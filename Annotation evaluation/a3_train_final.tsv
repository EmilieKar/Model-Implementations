Looking at the way the numbers were collected, analyzed and reported-- I realized that it's asinine to lend any credibility to any of them, as their failure to collect relevant data has fatally flawed the ability to have an accurate account that meets any sort of unbiased scientific standard, making the data-- by definition-- unreliable. 4. "People that are asymptomatic can spread the virus while appearing healthy". Seems to be the concept driving mask mandates, however; Asymptomatic individuals have NEVER been the drivers of Outbreaks, Epidemics, nor Pandemics-- EVER, in the history of airborne viruses of ANY type. I'm not aware of any conclusive unbiased data which shows the breakdown of the transmission rate of asymptomatic SARS-covid2, c19, influenza, swine flu, bird flu or any other... relative to being the driver of an outbreak that rises to the level of an epidemic or a pandemic.

0/0	14 obvious crucial questions about the Covid vaccines ‚ÄúThey‚Äù originally promised the only way back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a vaccine for coronavirus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù obviously lied. Fri Jan 29, 2021 - 8:26 pm EST January 29, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) - According to the government... If I get vaccinated: 1.- Can I stop wearing the mask? Government Response - No 2.- Can they reopen restaurants, pubs, bars etc and everyone work normally? Government Response - No 3.- Will I be resistant to covid? Government Response - Maybe, but we don't know exactly, it probably won't stop you getting it 4.- At least I won't be contagious to others anymore? Government Response - No you can still pass it on, possibly, nobody knows. 5.- If we vaccinate all children, will school resume normally? Government Response - No 6.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop social distancing? Government Response - No 7.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands? Government Response - No 8.- If I vaccinate myself and my grandfather, can we hug each other? Government Response - No 9.- Will cinemas, theatres and stadiums be reopened thanks to vaccines? Government Response - No 10.- Will the vaccinated be able to gather? Government Response - No 11.- What is the real benefit of vaccination? Government Response - The virus won't kill you. 12.- Are you sure it won't kill me? Government Response - No 13.- If statistically the virus won't kill me anyway ... Why would I get vaccinated?" Government Response - To protect others. 14.- So if I get vaccinated, the others are 100% sure I'm not infecting them? Government Response - No So to summarize, the Covid19 vaccine... Does not give immunity. Does not eliminate the virus. Does not prevent death. Does not guarantee you won‚Äôt get it. Does not prevent you from getting it. Does not stop you passing it on Does not eliminate the need for travel bans. Does not eliminate the need for business closures. Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns. Does not eliminate the need for masking. So...what is it actually doing? You haven‚Äôt forgotten that ‚Äúthey‚Äù originally promised the only way back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a vaccine for coronavirus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù obviously lied. In addition, a number of prominent leaders have lately been insisting there will be no return to normal. They are now very open about saying that everything has permanently changed to a ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù Klaus Schwab ‚Äì founder of the World Economic Forum ‚Äì makes it very clear in this excerpt from a talk by him. Everything that we are going through right now, including very dangerous, catastrophic lockdowns, will remain with us forever. Dr. Simone Gold talk below) that are not allowed to be used, is their excuse for this dramatic, imposed change on the entire world population for a virus and for the large majority of the population. Their supposed solution of the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù covid vaccine, as you can see from the above list, is not really a medical solution at all. It is not only not effective, it is increasingly looking to be unusually dangerous for an alleged ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù, which it is not. Dr. Gold has recently given one of the best talks to date on the virus and dangers of the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù vaccines. Everyone should watch this talk. It should be promoted around the world. So, again, what is the real purpose of these vaccines? They have already told us ‚Äì control of everyone to impose a New World Order/4th Industrial Revolution. We will all be required to have a vaccine passport or digital proof of vaccine, just as in Communist China, in order to enjoy already God-given rights and freedoms. Democracy and national sovereignty will be taken away and replaced by rule by a small, very powerful and wealthy elite. Everyone needs to stop watching all television and newspaper news and actively organize to oppose this world tyranny. Anyone who believes any of their propaganda and goes along with it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.
0/0	15 days to flatten the curve didn't stop the tyranny. Wearing masks didn't stop the tyranny. Lockdowns didn't stop the tyranny. Taking the vaccine didn't stop the tyranny. Compliance isn't helping you.

0/0	17% of test subjects had side effects from the vaccine. Not mild vaccine, most stage 3 and some stage 4. Stage 5 is death.

1/1	6 cases / 6,800,000 J&J vaccines = 0.00008823% -Per Statista odds dying choking on food is 1 in 2535! The damage to the trust and confidence of potential vaccine recipients is far greater than the risk of this potential adverse reaction. This is terrible medical risk management.
1/1	6 cases in 7 million vaccines. A less than 1 in 100,000,000 chance Chance of the same blood clot if you get covid....1 in 20 But you assholes didn't mention that did you.

What's the real threat? Meanwhile the military is coercing service members into the "voluntary" vaccines by not allowing them to dine in at dining facilities and restricting their use of fitness facilities if they decline the Vax.
1/1	6:40 he's way under selling it, one shot is 80% effective against infection two weeks after your shot. Is it perfect? No. But it's still very good and it's VERY unlikely you get this virus after one shot

1/1	@Marcos Aur√©lio If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine and get infected, you‚Äôre giving the virus another chance to mutate towards something new that the vaccine can‚Äôt protect other vaccinated people from. If the new virus that evolves in your body spreads again, the pharmaceutical company won‚Äôt have readily studied vaccine against it. In another sentence, the vaccine would be outdated, if there‚Äôs such a mutation. Therefore, by not taking the vaccine, you could be aiding the virus in its evolution and forcing everyone to go through the pandemic again. I hope this answers your questions.
0/-1	@MarcusTriton I've asked before, if you're sick from the vaccine, (like my neighbours were) are you a danger to me? I know as many people who got sick from the vaccine as from covid. Whether they really are contagious, who knows...perhaps the current human trials will tell us.

1/1	A late birthday present yesterday, first instalment of covid vaccine. No pain, no side effects, just lingering concern that I got called because someone else failed to show. Get the vaccination folks.
0/0	A lifetime business, I knew it, annual vaccination, they won't find a cure because it's not good business to eliminate the virus completely, but an annual vaccine is good business, and what's one's life expectancy with the unexpected side effects of the vaccine now that it's regular annual?
1	A little more hope. This is good news. Now we just need everyone to do this properly, wear a mask, keep your distance and only go out/do things of you really have to. If we all pulled together from the start we may not have been in the position we are now. Stay safe everyone
1/1	A lot of conspiracy theorists here... if only we had a vaccine to remove them.
0/-1	A lot of health care professionals have said they are going to wait a year.
1/1	A lot of people are being sarcastic about the vaccine, but shortly there will be real benefits to taking it, such as convenience in international travel (immunity to quarantines), not to mention if you go on business trips to China, your company will likely require you to take the vaccine anyway. You'll know what I'm talking about if you work at an international company.
1/1	A lot of people got sucked into the QAnon conspiracy theories about vaccinations and many millions still are. This woman is lucky that she finally came to her senses.
0/0	A lot of people have been expressing some concern over the safety of this vaccine because of the fast development.
0/0	A lot of people have died after they got vaccinated
1/-1	A lot of people know or think this covid 19 vaccination is painful is because of other type of vaccinations like for example the vaccination for the little children when they are 3, 4, 5, or 6 months old so they won't get a virus, sickness or infection. the little children vaccination hurts or feel painful when these children get it and if you want to know because of other type of vaccinations that is not for covid 19 people really think is painful , so people are not getting a covid 19 vaccination that easy
1/1/1	A lot of people seem to understand vaccination as *only* personal protection, when in fact it is *mostly* societal protection.
1/1	A lot of people who are against the vaccine are like "I cannot trust the people who encourage you to take it" and I always respond with "Then do you know more than medical professionals?" because the only people who are against the vaccines are not doctors.
1/1	A lot of these diseases were eradicated until the most recent dangerous trend of not vaccinating kids, and cases of measles were reported in the US.

0/0	A safe vaccine usually takes up to 15 years to develop. Long term side effects which may only occur years later need to be studied first.
1/1	A shame we have to wait six months to get it, but good news regardless.
1/1	A significant feature is... it is a single dose vaccine.. which will make vaccination campaign wide spread and relatively comfortable to do. Will add impetus to our war on pandemic .
1/1	A simple rule: love your vaccine, take it everytime they ask you to, wear as much masks as it possible to do it at once and stay self isolated forever. We can safe this world and become heroes for upcoming generations!

0/0	A vaccine a preparation containing live, attenuated or inactivated (killed) microorganisms (or some part or product of them), that is used to stimulate an IMMUNE RESPONSE in the recipient, which gains IMMUNITY. Only due to the state of "emergency" are these allow to be called vaccine. There is no proof that either of these do either. Who will take the blame for all these deaths for with holding HCQ from us?? Follow the money!!
1	A vaccine cannot cause COVID-19. No vaccine contains a complete form of the virus responsible for this illness. While their body builds immunity, it is normal for a person to experience minor side effects.

0/0	Absolute Bullshit. They didn't do any of the Testing that they would normally do for a Vaccine.
1/1	Absolutely - Yes 100%! I will be taking the vaccine the very moment that my turn comes!
0/0	Absolutely NOT.. AT THIS MOMENT... DON'T GET VACCINATED .. LET ALL THE GUINEA PIGS GET IT FIRST SEE WHAT THE LONG-TERM EFFECT IS GOING TO BE PLUS THEY HAVE NO IDEA ITS GOING TO ACTUALLY WORK...
0/1	Absolutely getting it. My dad, friend, and niece got Moderna vaccine. Only side effect was 1 had a little soreness in arm. My healthy 43 yo cousin got Covid, it caused a blood clot in her leg, and they had to amputate.
1/1	Absolutely getting the vaccine. Here's why: I understand how it works, I know it doesn't contain ANY virus & therefore can't infect me, it won't change my DNA, & they're not implanting an RFID chip. Pfizer & Moderna were tested on 74K ppl, & millions more have been vaxxed safely.

1/1	Absolutely my ‚Äòfavourite‚Äô way to describe vaccination : empathy for others.
0/0	Absolutely no need for young healthy people to take this vaccine, none whatsoever. I will absolutely NOT be told that I need to take something against my will
0/0	Absolutely no way I would get that, especially not if I was pregnant! So many babies have been lost, 2 pregnant doctors lost their pregnancies
0/0	Absolutely not. Although SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a slightly nastier virus than usual, it‚Äôs not anything to panic about. The world has gone absolutely nuts about this, but if you study the science, dig into the situation, you‚Äôll realize that what we have is panic and not a dangerous virus that calls for extreme measures. The ‚Äúcure‚Äù has been far, far, far worse than the disease.
0/0	Absolutely not. I don‚Äôt get flu shots, pneumonia vaccines, or anything else, either. I never get the flu, but everyone I know who gets a flu shot ends up with the flu. And I have a couple of autoimmune diseases and have no idea what havoc the vaccine might cause in my body. Besides, I‚Äôve had COVID already and it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal.
0/0	Absolutely not. Not a wise decision. People need to wise up and do their due diligence. Turn off the programming and ask themselves some questions. Like: why would anyone trust ANY of those people in ANY situation? They absolutely do NOT have our best interest at heart. They want to bring the population down to less than 5% of what it is now and THEY'VE TOLD US SO. WAKE UP! .

0/0	Absolutely not. Not unless they force me too. I will not take a vaccine with an MRNA component on moral grounds. I am allergic to some of the components. I react to even a flu vaccine.
0/0	Absolutely unbelievable that vaccine passports are even being considered for experimental vaccines that have not been tested on the long-term; and will not be ready for protocol approval until 2023! Irresponsible. People are so desperate to get on with their lives that they are willing get a vaccine and not necessarily for their health, but for ther freedom!
1/-1	Absolutely yes. If there were substantial negative side effects we‚Äôd have seen them by now. That‚Äôs what such extensive trials are for.
1/1	Absolutely!! Thank you for looking out for healthcare professionals, CDC! Pharmacists have been excitedly getting vaccinated!
1/1	Absolutely, yes!Vaccines are probably the single greatest advance in preventative medicine ever made by the human race. Furthermore, they are getting safer and safer. Vaccines that don‚Äôt even contain a whole pathogen, dead or alive, are an awesome advance.
1/1/1	Absolutely. As soon as I can.The vaccine manufacturers have exercised great caution and subjected the vaccines to intense third party unbiased testing and review. The test data are extremely impressive and the good the vaccines will bring is far beyond the risks.
1/-1	Absolutely. Easy choice.
1/1	Absolutely. I don't want to contract Covid, nor do I want to be spreading it around. I will take the vaccine gladly, as often as needed.
1/1	Absolutely.I am male and I am in my 60‚Äôs. I am in one of the highest risk groups in the population
1/-1	Absolutely.I am male and I am in my 60‚Äôs. I am in one of the highest risk groups in the population.
1/1	Absolutely~!! The vaccine development was moving faster than normal because the scientific community made it their top priority all over the world! Thank you for protecting American lives, CDC!
1/-1	According to a CNN article: "In Moderna's trial, 15,000 study participants were given a placebo, which is a shot of saline that has no effect. Over several months, 90 of them developed Covid-19, with 11 developing severe forms of the disease. Another 15,000 participants were given the vaccine, and only five of them developed Covid-19. None of the five became severely ill." I do not know much about about vaccines, but that seems absolutely amazing.
1/1/1/1	According to health experts, there could be regular side effects expected after a vaccination, such as muscle aches. But similar to other types of vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines undergo trials and testing involving thousands of volunteers...
0/0	According to history vaccines don't work. When I came to this country I had to be vaccinated did it work? no, not even the flu shot works just to make money. One day judgement day will come when God judges all these greedy politicians.
0/0/0	According to lib science there's 969 genders and men can have menstrual periods. I am Not going to trust their "science."
1/1	According to the CDC's 2017 report, 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months were vaccinated against MMR, 92.7% against polio. Vaccination acceptance is way more universal than the internet's portrayal of vaccination rates
1/1	According to the WHO, "there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection."

0/0	Actually here in London 75percent of NHS doctors and nurses have refused the vaccine so please educate yourself beyond one video lol
1/1	Actually my friend had no adverse effects after the injection
0/0	Actually, COVID-19 caused less mortality than the flu up until around the 15-24 age range last year. Measles has been identified to have an IFR of around .5% in children, whereas COVID is estimated around 0.003% for 0-19.
0/0	Actually, mrna has NEVER been used on humans, a quick Google search will show you that. And yes, I know its been used in trials BUT never actually used on humans.
0/0	Actually, no one in the world should take it.
0/0	Actually, not being sick means your immune system is working. There is nothing normal about injecting this crap into your body for a supposed ‚Äúvirus‚Äù that has a 99.7% recovery rate. FFS How does anyone believe this nonsense?
1/1	Actually, the vaccine does help stop you from becoming seriously ill with the virus, and substantially reduces your likelihood of infecting others.
1/1	Actually, we NEED #Vaccine .
0/0	Add another measure to the chart... deaths from corona vaccine...anyone who dies 28 days of having a vaccine..
1/1	Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 ‚Äî making it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd immunity
1/1	Additionally mRNA vaccines have been USED in cancer therapy successfully.
1/1	Admittedly my plan was to wait on a vaccine so I could get the good one rather than the first one however with the 1st seemly to have a 90% effectiness perhaps the 1st is the correct choice. I have two risk factors and my county has a 15% positivity rate so might be of the essence.

1/1	After all this time we are still in the fight , hopefully we'll be able to put this "COVID-19 behind us ..
1/1	After doubts were raised about the safety of the Oxford vaccine ( what we call Covishield) the UK immediately imported 1.7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and is already injecting people. That‚Äôs the kind of pro active approach our Covid czars need to follow
1/-1	After getting my first COVID vaccine, I can confirm it gives you 5G. My phone bars have increased exponentially and I've even activated augmented hearing. Well worth the effort it took to finding a vaccine.
1/1	After getting the pfizer vaccine i was so happy but the pain in my arm was bad but thats aight

1/1	After receiving two shots, I can visit my friends
1/1	After seeing the information and doing my research I am excited for this type of vaccine it opens the door on so many possibilities.
1/1/1	After seeing what happened yesterday we're going to need all the vaccines we can get.

1/1	After taking vaccine, there were no side effects affecting normal life.
1/1	After the first shot, everything was fine, just my arm was sore a bit.
1/1	After the vaccine is injected, your body uses instructions in the DNA/RNA to make copies of this virus part (or antigen). Your body recognises these and mounts an immune response, ready to protect you the next time you encounter the virus.
1/1	After the vaccine, there were no side effects affecting normal life.
1/1	After this explanation, I'm ready to cancel my vaccine appointment. Just kiddingüò∑
1/1	After waiting 2 weeks for the vaccine to kick in, I joined up with some vax‚Äôd friends for some long-awaited tabletop throwdown. I didn‚Äôt realize how badly I missed in-person gaming, but now I can‚Äôt wait until we have Covid under control so we can bring back conventions safely
1/1	After watching this and a few other videos I definitely feel safe taking this vaccine.
1/1	After we passed 100 million vaccinations in the EU, I‚Äôm very glad I got my first shot of #COVID19 vaccine today. Vaccinations will further gather pace, as deliveries are accelerating in the EU. The swifter we vaccinate, the sooner we can control the pandemic. #StrongerTogether
1/-1	After we're vaccinated, must we still wear a mask to protect those who have not been vaccinated?
1/1	After you get the first vaccination, your body is reving up the immune system and ready to fight COVID if it comes.
1/1	Again, VERY VERY HAPPY I GOT THE VACCINE, LOVE ME SOME VACCINATION, but whoooo boy, last night was ROUGH. That second shot does NOT play, and I'm very glad I'd already put stuff in motion to take today off completely.

0/-1	All fd up.. part of the whole big machine mechanism.. we're not dealing with parties and election's, this has taken a totally different turn.. I've said it before and we were told, if you didn't understand it then!? you better start right now!
0	All garbage vaccines, and they're not even vaccines by definition.
1/1	All good News showing slowly we are going in the right direction ,I personally waiting for the one from Oxford University then i feel we are turning the corner .
0/0	All governments of the world have gone mad. WHO is useless.
0/0/0/0	All is a big lie!!!!! Good luck if you survive a few years after getting vaccinated.
1/1	All medications carry risks. Don't want it? Don't get it, simply as that really. As for me, fill me up.
1/1	All my coworkers reacted to their shot within 24 hours, so when I had no reaction during that time, I thought I was in the clear. But, nope. 36 hours later, I was in bed alternating between chills and feeling like I was burning up. 48 hours post vaccine, all better! Worth it.
1/1	All my grandparents have been now vaccinated against Covid in Chile! Super happy and hoping that everyone will receive a vaccine in time!!!
1/1	All my mum (84) talked about for the past year was finding a vaccine for Covid. Today, though she‚Äôs in recovery after surgery, she smiled when I told her we‚Äôve started vaccinations.
0/0	All of these people are pushing a lie. It does not exist. And by it I mean "you know what-19".
0/-1	All of these things, and more, have been mentioned in claims that we‚Äôve seen on the internet, or heard about from people who contacted us.
0/0	All of this hasn‚Äôt been studied long enough, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not getting it
1/1	All parents have a responsibility to their children and society to have them vaccinated unless there is a real contraindication. The proof is there and is easily available.
0/0	All poison period.
0/-1	All sheepeople line up first
0/0	All that happened when I had the wuflu was I lost my sense of smell and gradually got it back. ... and a headache that came and went for a couple days (not bad enough to take anything). Sounds better than the vaccine.
0/0	All that take their corno vaccine will I am sure have delayed sickness perhaps death untraceable to the vaccine they will have deniability
0/0	All the Pzifer deaths are just ignored and not reported in MSM.
1/1	All the anti vax covid deniers crying about a 0.0004% chance of a bloodclot from the #AstraZeneca vaccine after spending a year saying they refuse to 'conform' to rules over a small chance of catching Covid. Looking forward to my 2nd AZ dose in the next couple of weeks.
1/1/1	All the anti vaxxers should be able to live on an island where they can freely contaminate one another with joy. The reason people born in the 70's and beyond don't have polio innoculation scars is because the vaccine WORKED
1/-1	All the credit go to scientists...not the golf and tweeter king.
1/-1	All the dislikes are ignorant people.
1/-1	All the doctors i've talked to have said that getting the vaccine is a good idea, idk though...all these people on social media tell me i should be worried. Idk who to trust more...
1/1	All the evidences points in favor of vaccination, just use your brain
1	All the feels for this! I was surprised that I got choked up seeing help on the way, this year has worn me down in ways I don‚Äôt even recognize yet. THANK YOU Pfizer-BioNTech, UPS, and FedEx for getting the vaccine distributed. Makes me proud to see it ship out of GR!
1/1	All the medicine has a risk of having allergy reactions. So why don‚Äôt you not give your kid medicine either.
0/0	All the negative commenters, you're commenting on a short trailer, watch the whole movie. There is more than enough proof. I grew up in Africa, we only got polio and German measles vaccinations. Most of us got measles, mumps, chicken pox, glandular fever etc We were away from school for a week, I never heard of any child dying. Now it's a vaccination for everything, even for the flu!!! It's a money making racket.
0/0	All the people lining up to recieve shots: 25,000 people tested said shot: long term effects unknown: 5 years later, everyone who recieved shot, grows ears and a tail.
1/1	All the results we have seen are mostly positive with Covid vaccine... fine if you cannot have it because of underlying health probs... but if not... everyone should comply
1/1	All the vaccines are safe and incredibly protective against severe COVID-19. They will keep you from getting really sick. They will keep you out of the hospital. They will save your life. They will help sustainably end transmission in the population.
1/1	All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it‚Äôs even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
0/0	All the youtube fools telling me to "trust the science" when I urged caution in the use of vaccines on people that are not at risk of covid 19. God i love being right.
1/-1	All them meds they tried and the vaccine won atleast he might of recovered from covid with what we can use against it now
0/0	All these are all well and good but vaccines are usually studied for years before releasing it to the public. Im still not convinced I need to take this.
0/0	All these idiots who say it's safe should be given the jab and even ten of them.and told to shut their mouths
0/0	All these medical conditions (except for the genetic mutations) can be mediated with gluten free casein free diet. Organic food. Filtered water/air. Nothing to do with vaccines.
0/0/0	All these vaccines are in the experimental stages are future symptoms and harm may take years to come out. say no to vaccines that are in experimental stages
0/0	All this bs and you still think this poison is safe???? Ya'll need to stop smoking whatever you're smoking.
0/-1	All this hit sound like a lie , when gods judgement come down it's gonna be hell on earth
0/1	All this hysteria for a simple flu, not taking a vaccine with that much side effects
1/1	All this population control conspiracy crap makes no sense. if the shots are that deadly, why would all the richest and most important people get it first?
1/0	All those infected experienced only a mild form of the disease, and NONE were hospitalized. So, get the covid vaccine. It may save your life.
1/1	All those people saying it must not be safe because it was done in such a short time, you got to stop and think maybe they had teams working round the clock, and that the vaccine was priority.
1/1/1	All those pundits and talking heads who wouldn't stop saying "it's going to take years at the current pace" just a few weeks ago are awfully quiet right now. Vaccines are the soloution to our problems and it has finally arrived.
0/0	All those vaccines made you autistic, as expected
0/0	All u have to do is just a little research, a tiny bit of research, and you‚Äôll run so far away from that vaccine !
0/0	All vaccines adverse reactions listed directly on the package insert is : DEATH
1	All vaccines and medications have side effects thats the truth but its still better to take them.
1/1	All vaccines are like that. That‚Äôs why we need everyone vaccinated. It‚Äôs 95% effective against getting sick at all though. The chicken pox vaccine is 60-100% effectiveness. When was the last time you heard of a kid getting chicken pox? Long time ago I bet.
0/0	All vaccines are poison, GMO, fetal tissue, animal gene. Be smart.
1/1	All vaccines are super safe.
1/1	All vaccines cause an auto immune response.
0/0	All vaccines in general are dangerous and ineffective. They have injured and killed people in the past.
0/0	All vax is poison.
0/0	All you need to know is anything that gets rushed and not studied or tested properly is not safe.,
0/0/0/0/0	All you need to know is you can still get COVID after taking the shot and you‚Äôll die wearing your mask because they‚Äôre never going away. So enjoy bells palsy and an assortment of other side effects.
0/0	All you people who say you won't take it need to stick with it. I don't want to be one of the last hold outs when they start blocking people from entering stores without proof of vaccination. Or if my job makes it mandatory. It has to be all of us.
0/0	Allah will save me, don‚Äôt need no needles
0/0	Allergic reaction. How about just Fucking Poison
0/0	Allergic reaction? Ya mean side affects
0/0	Allergic reactions and face paralysis are some of the side effects so far. You would have to be out of your mind to take the vaccine.
1/1	Almost 76% Americans with one shot now! We are getting so close to being done with this thing.
1/1	Almost convinced me that perhaps COVID-19 could be used to get rid of some of the stupid ones! This is a pandemic boys and girls. It can kill a lot of people. The rules are intended to keep,you safe from it.
1/0	Almost every complication shows up within two weeks. So far, the mild side effects are the ones you want
1/1	Almost like it‚Äôs causing an immune response based on the antibodies your body has been making since the first dose.
0/0	Almost like they want us to just shut up and obey and take this new untested experimental vaccine for some reason they seem desperate that we all take it.
0/0	Almost looks like a conspiracy to make people infertile, like they are more worried about overpopulation than the actual virus.
1/1	Almost no one over the age of 65 is against vaccines, why? Because thees people saw friends and family crippled or die from times before vaccines.
1/1	Almost time to help our lovely Canadian pals! Also I got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday and I‚Äôm HYPED
1	Already been a little over six hours since my first dose, and aside of the ungodly arm pain I‚Äôm experiencing right now, I‚Äôm feeling fine. #CovidVaccine
1/1	Already contracted the shitty thing during first wave so not in a big rush to get vaccinated. Not afraid of vaccines and will happily do it to help vulnerable people out there but I will wait my turn since I‚Äôm in my late 20s. Would love more info about possible adverse reactions (I have few allergies myself) and the likelihood of reinfections (suffered from IRDS as I was a premature child and I‚Äôm terrified I used up all my ‚Äúgood odds‚Äù with first infection - so I hope it happens only once) but I guess I can only wait for that.
1/1	Already got dose two. A sore arm and an afternoon nap were a price worth paying. If only someone had actually done something like this six months ago instead of trying to suppress testing and lying about the severity of the issue...
1/1	Already got my first dose.
1/1	Already got my first shot. I can't wait for a normal summer.
1/1	Already got my flu vaccine and I can't wait to get the COVID vaccine
0/0	Already had and recovered from covid. I wont be taking any vaccine anytime soon. I'm going to need to see alot more long term effects results
0/0/0/0/0	Already had covid not taking a vaccine
1/1	Already have. And I feel great.
1/0	Alrhough I don't understand everything, at least I understand something! Ty, Jesus bless you Medcram
1/1	Alright Mary it's time to go to bed, yall don't want to take a vaccine that has passed multiple human trials, no hospitalizations, no deaths, and still are naive to it. If it makes you feel better Trump was one who started funding and made sure it was safe üòè So you're so-called "Micro Chip" theory can get put to rest
1/1	Also I hope you fall into one of the tiers approved for vaccination. Please dont jump the line.
1/1	Also I‚Äôm getting the second covid vaccine today
0/-1	Also had someone we know die 3 days after the vaccine and he was only 36 healthy
1/1	Also if doctors were al a part of some conspiracy why would they all be getting it?
0/0	Also if you have a strong immune system there is no need for the vaccine
0/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself.
1/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself. You do realize it's still not as bad as the flu right?
1/1	Also mind blowing when ppl say they won't get the vaccine because they don't know the long term effects (which i agree to an extent) , but yet don't give a shit about the long term effects covid has. I rather get the vaccine than get covid.
0/0	Also the amish never take vaccines and therefore you will never find an autistic amish.
1/1	Also this morning, I've had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	Also, I researched the vaccines attempts for sars and mers. Yes, there will be some post injection adverse reactions but it was the long term immune system issues that were the problem. Have not found anything yet that says they overcame those issues. So, the long term consequences are not known by the public but pretty sure the vaccine pushers know.
1/1	Also, brain clots aren't contagious, Covid is. I've got my 2nd AV Jab in a couple of weeks, and have exactly zero concerns.
0/0	Altering instructions with mRNA to respond to a virus is genetic manipulation and changes the DNA blueprint that you are born with.....no thanks, i'll stay me.
1/1	Alternative title: Kurzgesagt politely roasting anti-vaxs in a nutshell.
1/1	Although I am not from the UK and will likely not receive any doses for the coming weeks, this is incredibly good news!! I hope other health agencies also finds the vaccine to be safe.
1/1	Although I've already had Covid I still plan on taking a vaccine eventually. I've been nervous about the mRNA vaccine but feel so much reassure by this explanation.
1/1	Although the vaccine is rushed that doesnt mean it isnt safe for use. they aren't just skipping past the "testing phase", they are still taking many precautions to make sure its effects do more good than harm.
0/0	Aluminum......Antifreeze.......Acetone.......Mercury.......Formaldehyde......Fetal Tissue.......It's everything you've ever wanted in a Vaccine or Witches Potion.
1/1	Always get my flu and other vaccines. Will get the covid vaccine as soon as it is available to seniors in Orlando
0/0	Always staying safe...too afraid to have it
1/1	Always vaccinate!
0/-1	Am A Little Bit Confused?!?
0/0	Am I the only one concerned about the possible long term carcinogenic effects of an mRNA vaccine?
0/0	Am not getting vaccine. Am healthy and drink more alcohol than water I'll be fine
0/0	Am not taking vaccine neither any of my kids taking that shit that's my law
1/1	Am seeing cases now of vaccinated patients not catching covid at all when exposed at home - or much milder illness, Dramatic local outbreak in local care home where those vaccinated were spared.This is 1st hand / coal face experience
0/0	Am very sceptical about this deadly vaccine.
1/1	Amazing explanation of these vaccines and how they work. Thank you so much for this video, you're an excellent teacher!
1/1	Amazing information in such dark times!! Got mine two weeks ago no side effects
1/1	Amazing news, get every one injected ASAP, let's get on top of this virus and get back to some kind of normality.
1/0/1	Amazing that we're getting to the point of dictating instructions to the cells
1/1	Amazing they have a vaccine already !
0/1	Amazing vaccine
1/-1	Amazing video bro, taught me so much and presented in a nice logical order with visuals. This is what they need to keep replaying on mainstream media for the rest of the idiiots.
1/1/1/1	Amazing what humans can do when we come together and throw a bunch of money at a common goal. This is why science funding is necessary.
1/-1	Amazing! Thank you for doing this!
0/0	Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? In order to avoid an illness with few or mild symptoms, you get a severe reaction, instead, to a vaccine which doesn‚Äôt actually protect you from the illness with few or mild symptoms that you‚Äôre trying to avoid.
0/0	Amen, sister!!! I'm not getting the shot, I'm healthy & feeling fine!! Tomorrow's my 73rd birthday üòäüòä
1/1	Amen. The risks of not getting vaccinated outweigh the risks of COVID. Period.
1/1	America has done an incredible job with the vaccines after that hiccup at the beginning
0/-1/-1	America wouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic
1/0/1/0/-1	America wouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic...
1/1/1/1	American here. Just received my J&J vaccine a few hours ago. So far, so good!
1/1	Americans don't know how fortunate they are to actually have the COVID vaccine so available right now. For most Latin American countries, we don't have a choice to make, it is simply not available. I'd love to get my mom and dad vaccinated so I can stop feeling so scared and anxious every single day. It baffles me that you guys are so privileged and don't even realize it sometimes.
0/0	Americans don't trust the msm for regular information. How can we trust them with our lives??
1/1	Americans have been eating themselves to death for decades but they don't seem to worry about that.
0/1	Americans have some serious trust issues! Doubting the medical field and the doctors. They think they know better than any expert.
0/0	Americans should also have the freedom to decline the vaccine
1/0	Americans: Show us the government officials taking the vaccine and we will see if they mutate into zombies or not. Americans when government officials take the vaccine on live national television: Look at how they blocked the view, its obviously water!
1/-1	Americas Frontline Doctors is the only place you should get your news regarding this nonsense
0/0	Amount of data on the long-term side effects - zero. Let that sink in.
1/1	An American doctor has said that oral contraceptives are much more likely to cause blood clots than the AZ vaccine.
0/0	An NHS nurse who has contracted Covid-19 three weeks after being vaccinated says she is "angry and heartbroken"
1/1	An anti vaxer getting autism would be an improvement.
0/0	An autoimmune reaction to the vaccine, and you wonder why more and more people are sick with autoimmune diseases.
1/1	An effective vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
0/0	An experimental emergency use vaccine for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you're sick.
0/0	An experimental emergency use vaccine... never before tested on humans.... for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it...and they are lining up for it ü§£üíâ
0/0	An risk of blood clotting isn't safe. There have been so many reports of adverse reactions.
0/0	An untested shot that wont keep you from getting the virus or keep you from spreading it?... so what is it?
1/-1	And I am NOT the only one reporting these side effects! It‚Äôs an immune response.
0/0	And I am still not taking it
0/0	And I thought the experts said the rushed to market vaccine was safe. This story is being covered by all news agencies before some keyboard warrior accuses me of being biased and not carrying out any further research.
1/1	And Im sitting here in good old Germany where they fucked everything up and people are going to be waiting month to get a vaccine. I did some research on a site and it suggested that if we continue to vaccine people this fast, then I'll be able to get one in November 2023. smfh.
0	And Now Anthony FAUCI announced that US will test vaccins onto all ages groups, down till 12yo this year, and ending with age : 6month to 2 years old at the beginning of 2022... WTF !!?
0/0	And can you say how many people has this vaccinacion has killed...and it has...no thank you i will not be injected‚Ä¶
1/1	And enough. Am getting the jab now.
1/1	And every single day, the number of Americans who will die will increase unless you #WearAMask and #Vaccinate
0/0	And getting that vaccine after living that long was the stupidest thing she could have ever done!
0/0	And hardly a word on taking care of yourself through a healthy lifestyle and not compromising your immune system. Its easier to believe that taking a vaccine that has never been used on humans and produced in the shortest time ever. So many questions answered with trust us. A vaccine that experts cannot tell us the duration of effectiveness, whether or not it will prevent you from transmitting, whether or not it will protect you from the mutations and of course long term adverse effects. I am not criticizing those that take it and will not tolerate criticism for not taking it.
0/0	And here goes down their fertility rate
1/1	And here we are at the end of the year with a vaccine that just got shipped to my state. Fantastic job!
0/0/0	And here we go! The VACCINATED are more likely to get the SA virus!
1/0	And how haven't we managed to get a 90 odd percent positive result with things like malaria etc? Is it because they don't affect us western whites as much? Seems weird that they have managed to create a vaccine that is so affective in such a short space of time to me??
1/1	And how many masked up people got sick and/or died from rona? Millions!!!! We are screwed either way but I am taking my chances with vax. I drive car, take hormone therapy, and work at high risk job. Life is full of risks. Won‚Äôt even go into my sucky ass genetica!
0/0	And if you have any allergies that you don‚Äôt know about don‚Äôt come !!!!!!
0/0	And it isn't just these v4ccines! Those long-term health issues are caused by most vaccines in some people. People with the wrong genetics, I suppose. I'm actually all for depopulation by sterilization. The poor and stupid human is a serious issue and there are too many of us. However, these long-term health issues are what I have a problem with. Another thing is that they're passed on through our descendants. NOT GOOD FOR HUMAN EVOLUTION.
0/0	And it‚Äôs finally happened. Broken heart Someone I‚Äôve worked with for almost 10 years passed away two nights ago , one week after his 1st Syringe.
0/0	And mannequins wearing them but what‚Äôs dangerous is the vaccine
0/0	And nobody should force me or anyone to take it
0/0	And not to mention all the big companies rolling out these untested vaccines like Pfizer have been sued to death and paid up huge fines for illegal marketing, improper labeling of medications, foreign corrupt practices, bribery, government contract related offenses and drug/medical equipment safety violations. But you can trust them.
1/1	And now there are three! This news just keeps getting better and better!
0/0	And now who is lining up to play guinea pigs
1/-1	And people complain about us Americans being uneducated, stubborn halfwits. The absolute gaul
0/0	And people die almost immediately, get very sick for weeks, oh and they do it on tv. For somthing no worse then the flu
1/1	And stay home. And get the vaccine.
0/0	And that‚Äôs how the beginning of I am legend started
0/0	And the animals in the mrna trials were "fine" right after, yet when exposed to illness their body had an auto immune reaction that killed them.
1/0	And the fear propaganda gets more deceptive and brazen. We still refuse to comply.
0/0	And the masses will receive this via mandated covid-19 vaccine.. good luck mandating me to take that...
0/-1	And the propaganda continues. Their day is coming when they will reap what they sow and it won't be pretty.
1	And the vaccine is the only thing today that can stop the pandemic
0/0	And these are NOT EVEN the LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS !!!!!
0/-1	And they honestly expect people who aren't even worried about Covid to get a vaccine like that???
0/0	And they say it were not lab created.....hm....I think it was! They are actually telling you how they created it without you understanding that they did create the virus!
0/0	And this is why I NEVER take the needle...and this is what the corrupt mainstream reports; can't imagine what they're not going to report.
0/0	And this vaccine alters your DNA and immune system and every child you ever make, if you will even be able to have kids after this. In the very small safety trials, 70% became infertile, and vaccinated males caused unvaccinated females to become infertile through their vaccine-altered sperm. By the way, the Pfizer vaccine has AIDS proteins in it and caused at least 60 people in Australia to become HIV positive, which they called ‚Äúfalse positives.‚Äù If someone injects you with part of the DNA protein strands of AIDS and you wind up HIV positive, then you‚Äôre HIV positive.
0/0/0/0/0/0	And those that die months or years after taking the vaccine will never be linked to the vaccine
0/0	And vaccines affect female fertility. Goes hand in hand.
1/1	And vaccines save lives !
0/0	And we are supposed to believe all this crap?
1/1	And we did nearly 600000 on Sunday probably more than the whole of the EU
0/0	And what are you going to do about the deaths its causing; i.e. Dr. in Florida died after getting the vaccine or the face paralysis or the other side effects that is happening?
0/0	And what is stopping your immune system attacking itself when it realizes there is a foreign entity in its cells?.
0/0	And what other info these mRna include ??!!!
0	And who‚Äôs going to be held accountable for this? NO ONE!
1/0	And within these populations they will pass Covid back and forth and takes us to ever more mutated viruses. The government will have to take serious steps both coercive and rewarding in the name of public health to encourage vaccination.
1/1	And yet my mother is still convinced the vaccines are actively killing otherwise completely healthy people. I can‚Äôt fucking wait to get vaccinated and rub it in her face
0/0	And yet people are dying who have taken the vaccines
0/0	And you didn't even mention potential long term damage to human cells get lost with your experiment
0/0	And you won't see this article on any other news site, that's for sure. I'm sure there is already in place a media black out reporting severe side effects or death from the vaccine. The problem is, you don't how it will effect you till it's too late. I'll take my chances with the virus.
0/0	Angelo Me too I'm not having this poison in my body just to be a rat on a wheel
0/0	Animals used in the studies died five months after.
1/0	Anit-vaxx mom be like: theres a 0.0001% chance my kid is gonna get a mild rash that can be treated easily? thats too dangerous might as well buy pills from a shady person in the alleys to cure my child
0/0	Annual shots?!?! No surprise there especially when it comes to Big Pharma....I'll rely on my antibodies and hope my body is going to keep me from harms way.
0/0	Another "vaccine" to refuse
1/1	Another Russia-bashing psyop campaign. Information warfare in progress. Bad vaccine? Just don't use it. Save the dose for the one who really needs it.
0/0	Another brainwashing... That gives me more warning NOT to have it
1/1	Another great result on COVID vaccine! AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine resulted in 67% reduction in positive swabs (i.e., infection) among those vaccinated. Vaccine will reduce transmission. Data also support 12 week prime-boost dosing interval.
1/1	Another great result on COVID vaccine! AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine resulted in 70% reduction in positive swabs (i.e., infection) among those vaccinated. Vaccine will reduce transmission. Data also support 12 week prime-boost dosing interval.
1/1	Another great vaccine to add to our collection, thank you to the scientist who have helped make this, those who volunteered to prove there safety much faster than normal due to lack of people, can't wait for my 2nd jab
0/0	Another lie from the WHO supposedly there to protect people? #EnoughIsEnough #covidnonsense to make people use chemical alternatives and prevent healthy people! We know better!
1/1	Another massively important finding is that in this huge trial, not a single person was hospitalized with Covid >22 days after single dose vaccination. Not one. That changes everything. Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
1/1	Another non-headline to grab attention .. a 'small study' ... why can't the media wait until the real people .. the scientists and the doctors ... have carried out extensive research to find out the exact facts. That of course wouldn't make a 'worrying, headline.
0/1	Another person died yesterday after the second dose...... #NoVaccineForMe
0/0	Another person dies after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccine4me
1/-1	Another reason for the vaccine is not to spread the virus.
1/1	Another reason to be mad at antivaxxers is because they can spread disease. Some people don‚Äôt have health insurance or could afford certain vaccines, meanwhile these people who do have health insurance and are privileged enough to afford it choose not to.
1/1	Another stupid anti-vaccine moron trumper
1	Another video where people are completely skipping over the convulsions. Still, the vaccine is statistically worth taking for those over 65.
1/1	Another well informed broadcast that helps to keep moral high and provides good understanding to us lay-people, thank you for your perseverance.
0/0	Answer "NO" why? because the polio epedemic happened after everyone was vacinated and 80,000,000 died
1/1	Anti Vaxxers mad

1/0	Anti Vaxxer‚Äôs: no
0/0	Anti vaccine is actually pro science
1/0	Anti vaccine kids: dies from sickness Anti vaccine mom: those dang video games
1/1	Anti vaccine movement is literally child neglect
1/1	Anti vaccine people are not stupid. They are selfish. Here is their reasonin: I didn't give the vaccine to my child and they are ok. Of course they are. Because all the other children were vaccinated, so the disease is under control.
0/1	Anti vaccine people: omg there kiling me
1/1	Anti vaccines means at least we won‚Äôt suffer too much overpopulation
1/1	Anti vax comments should not be allowed Anyone who doesn‚Äôt get the vaccine should be banned from going out
1/1	Anti vax people only take INSANELY small portions of people that probably are allergic to it.
1/-1	Anti vax strikes back
0	Anti vax? Or free choice?
1/1	Anti vaxer liability outweighs far greater than the insignificant risk of those taking the shots, to their society and to humanity in a highly connected world order
1/1	Anti vaxers, anti covid people are completely brain washed idiots
1/1	Anti vaxxers are fuming
1/1	Anti vaxxers are misinforming ignorant people. I trust science and would definitely get the vaccine.
1/1	Anti vaxxers aren't operating on empirical evidence or logic.
1/1	Anti vaxxers do not grasp the fact that risk for disease increases exponentially when more and more people forgo vaccines. They are entitled and selfish
1/1	Anti vaxxers give me tourrettes.
1/1	Anti vaxxers live in their cupboards with NO connection to the real world.
1/1	Anti vaxxers should be put on a list and denied medical help when they contract COVID ! Simple

0/1	Anti vaxxers were once all for vaccines until they witnessed a decline in their child's health following a vaccine.
0/1	Anti vaxxers were once all for vaccines until they witnessed a decline in their child's health following a vaccine. In the scientific literature, its well documented that vaccines can induce an over reaction in the immune system commonly known as a cytokine storm. Yet, when this happens and it leads to death or autoimmune diseases, almost everyone has been programmed to say, "it couldn't be the vaccines"
1/1	Anti vaxxers, America isn't the world.
1/1/1	Anti vaxxers: "There is no proof of the virus" People and medical workers who've died from the virus:ok I guess
1/1	Anti vaxxers: this sign cant stop me because i cant read
1/1	Anti-Vaccination culture will be the downfall of Society as we know it.
1/1	Anti-Vaccination culture will be the downfall of Society as we know it. I really had hope that maybe it was just a fluke - but people really believe this is poison from the government or bill gates or whatever the next conspiracy theory is. I pray for these men and women, and hope that science somehow becomes part of their education.
1/1	Anti-Vaxers: The black plague stopped naturally without any help of any vaccines 1/3 of Europe: Am I a joke to you?
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers are crazy. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. Even vaccines that effects you higher than the average will be protecting a person from that disease.
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers with no qualifications in virology: * Nervous Sweating *

1/1	Anti-Vaxxers? smh more like pro-diseaser
1/1	Anti-vaccine "parents" should have their children taken away as quickly as possible. When do innocent children's right to live beat parents right to choose? I say, "every single goddamn time."
1/1/1	Anti-vaccine movement is the origins of parents that want their kids to die movement.
1/1	Anti-vaccine party‚Äôs are stupid..
1/1	Anti-vax kids be having midlife crisis at 2

1/1	Anti-vax logic: This bridge is only 99.998% safe. I'll swim across the crocodile-infested water instead.
1/1	Anti-vaxers are heroes. Single handily saving endangered deadly diseases from going extinct.
1/1	Anti-vaxers are selfish people, as many as possible needs to take the vaccine to get herd-immunity
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are actually sub-human troglodytes that somehow managed to sneak into normal society, its surprising how they are still alive considering the essential oils they take must have melted their organs by now. Oh well, it's not like they were worth much anyways.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are an existential threat to humanity. End of discussion.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are immune to logic and facts. Why even bother.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are nothing else but idiots IMHO.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are still going to say that this video is a hoax
1/1	Anti-vaxxers be like: ‚Äútold ya‚Äù, and then go get in their car and drive 80+ MPH on the freeway without a seatbelt.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers call Covid vaccines "experimental" Well -the experiment is to see if very safe vaccines with proven efficacy can reduce the burden of disease, save lives and get us out of lockdown. That's something me and over 300 million others are delighted to be a part of!
0/1	Anti-vaxxers harass people waiting on line to get the vaccine at Dodger Stadium
1/0/1	Anti-vaxxers in a nutshell: "I don't care if you get sick because of me. My body, my choice. Your body, my choice"
1/1/1/1	Anti-vaxxers literally make me cry. Because they could kill me.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they‚Äôre the type of people who just... reject science.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they‚Äôre the type of people who just... reject science. We can have differing opinions all day long, but only when they‚Äôre legitimate opinions based in a world of facts. You can‚Äôt just deny science. It‚Äôs fucking science.
1/-1	Anti-vaxxers should be denied health care when they get sick.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers should be excluded from society. They should not be allowed to enter stores, schools, theaters, bars, restaurants or any other place where large groups gather. They are biohazards and should be treated like biohazards.
1/0	Anti-vaxxers will point out the low mortality risk of Covid as evidence of its triviality but will use info like the above as "proof" that vaccines are dangerous.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers will survive WWZ Because they have no brain
1/1	Anti-vaxxers. I hope they catch it.Then just watch them panic for medical attention. Idiots.
1/1/1	Anti-vaxxers: Vaccines are NOT TESTED FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY! They never have been! Vaccine researchers: currently testing covid vaccines for safety and efficacy. Anti-vaxxers: ...... 5G!!!
1/1	Anti-vaxxing is all about taking unsubstantiated misinformation as fact
0/0	Antibody dependent enhancement ADE was caused by the SARS Cov 1 vaccine years ago during testing and it was never approved. This also happened with the Dengue vaccine. as it does with many RNA viruses. There were no long term safety trials to determine if this will happen with this vaccine. so count me out. I'm not taking this vaccine and becoming a part of the largest vaccine trial in history.
0/0	Antigenic shift (mutation) is a common normal biological function among coronavirus /more so with flu. This is precisely why vaccines have little to no chance of effectiveness for Corona type viruses. History has proven this true over and over. Corna vaccines are notoriously problematic ( mostly due to rapid weakening) and have never been successful.
0/0	Antivax for life
1/1	Antivax logic: theres a 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of me breaking my neck while looking left and right before crossing the road guess i'll just suddenly walk forward
1/1	Antivax nonsense. No safety steps are being skipped over. Different trial stages are being run concurrently, rather than after the previous stage. They're being performed in different populations concurrently across the globe, rather than after eachother. Your skepticism is simply ignorance.
1/1	Antivaxer: ‚ÄúMy body, my choice.‚Äù Also antivaxer: ‚ÄúYour body, my choice.‚Äù
1/1	Antivaxers and antimaskers should be put on a desert island so sane people can work on achieving herd immunity
1/1	Antivaxers are idiots
1	Antivaxers, more like natural selection employees
1/-1	Antivaxxer complained that all the cats at my local shelter are vaccinated. There are diseases which are untreatable in cat‚Äôs which can be vaccinated against

1/1	Antivaxxers are a dumb breed of people
1/1	Antivaxxers are those people who would flip out if you told them that all water contains dihydrogen monoxide and that 100% of people who consume it ultimately die!
1/1	Antivaxxers think the syringe and needle is for a horse but they're so tiny it fits in a babies hand.
1/0	Antivaxxers will be the death of themselves
1/1	Antt-vaxxers should be arrested and their children taken from them.
0/0	Any Person with a well nurished Immunsystem doesn't need this vaccine. I hope it will not made mandatory for everyone.
0/0	Any chance the cell-manufactured spike protein, on exiting the cell membrane, could then instead turn around and plug into the very same cell receptors on the outside of the cell membrane that the whole virus would normally use? Where I'm going with this, is if the answer is 'yes', then what would happen if a cell was then swamped with spikes stuck on it's outside - i.e: would it then look like 'non-self' to our immune system, and come under attack(!), effectively causing some kind of auto-immune disease ? . . . also, you didn't address the allergic deleterious issue with the novel lipid nanoparticle, causing issues in some people . . .
1/1	Any coronavirus vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.
1/1	Any country that doesnt provide a vaccine to all their people for free is hurting themselves by doing so. Glad to see Canada has the right idea!
0/0	Any long term effects on this vaccine? I won't be taking it.
0/0	Any long term safely studies? I'll give it a miss then
1/1	Any option is a good option rn, we need as many people vaccinated as possible ASAP.
1/1	Any progress toward prioritizing Indiana teachers for COVID vaccination?
1/1/1	Any side effect is a reasonable pay off for the opportunity to protect ourselves from this virus.
1/1	Any side effects you'll get are temporary and short-lived
0/-1	Any test results data to proof what they say? Or should we blindly beleive all what pharma say?
1/1	Any vaccine Dr. Anthony Fauci recommends is one I will get.
1/1	Any vaccine is a better chance of NOT having clots than not getting it at all. Bring back the J&J.
0/0	Any vaccine that goes from the experimental lab, to production, to distribution in less than 10 months... Is something we should all have confidence in.... Lol
1/1	Any vaccine that passed its trial is better than no vaccine. And one shot is better than no shot. Just focus on vaccinating as many people as possible as fast as possible.
1/1	Anybody find it funny that the same person who says that they're not taking the vaccine because they don't know what's in it is the same person that you see at the fast food drive thru 6 out of 7 days a week??
0/0	Anybody getting the vaccine PERIOD, should be concerned.
0/1	Anybody think about getting an antibody test before considering getting the vaccine??? I mean according to cc studies back in may of 2020 there was more than 10x the amount of ppl getting the virus who had already had it....I don't understand why our nation is so forgetful and spinning in this wheel over and over...
0/-1	Anybody want some free snake oil? Side effects may include, but not limited to, blood clots and death.
1/1	Anybody who refuses vaccine should be denied treatment for covid.
0/0	Anybody willing to get a vaccine that comes out a year after the pandemic starts is an absolute idiot.
0/0	Anyone else a little wary of a vaccine pumped out this fast?

0/0	Anyone else's comments keep getting removed?? Anything too "anti-vax" is censored. That is very telling. We are all being duped, people.

0	Anyone heard about that new spunknic vacine.. you dont need to have the jab you can swallow it ughh
0/-1	Anyone here can have my share....Cheers
1/1	Anyone in the healthcare field should have their license revoked if they won't get this vaccine.
1/1	Anyone not getting vaccinated is obeying the propaganda of the white supremacists, the patriots, etc....Get vaccinated!
0/0	Anyone saying they're anxious to get it especially online, is working for big pharma or trolling for government. The government can't fully control you if they don't get you hooked on these jabs. Ask yourself if you made it through 2020 till now and the stats are showing the Rona is leveling out why are you getting it for a thing in which is still mutating? Do you notice how there is no mention by government of taking care of yourself by eating right, and taking vitamins
0/0	Anyone taking a vaccine for a disease that has a 99%+ recovery rate needs their head examined
0/0	Anyone taking any vaccine created in less than a year, not tested on animals, not tested for future birth defects, must be crazy.
0/0	Anyone that is saying the vax's are safe are lying and obviously being paid to do so, either that or they are just plain stupid.
0/0/0	Anyone trying to give me a shot is going to have the worst day ever of their life.
1/1	Anyone using any type of modern medicin shouldnt be to worried about a simple vaccine. Read the disclosier of adhd medicin for example and and see the risks that affect 1 in 10.000. Not 1 in 1.000.000 Ow and one of the risks u have from using ritalin for example, is death and infection in arteries in ur brain.. not just "simple" blood clot. Chill guys its a simple vaccine..
0/0	Anyone want to explain why more people than ever are vaccinated but the rates of covid are still going up??
0/0	Anyone who attempts to physically force me to take a vaccine is going to be met with a dragon like force
1/1	Anyone who does not want to be vaccinated is fine. But then do the world a favor and stay home forever, thank you.
0/-1	Anyone who listens to this and follow it, good luck!
0/0	Anyone who recieves the vaccine will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. Tell my people to avoid the vaccine. God is warning all His children. This is the end.
1/1	Anyone who wants a shot is getting it in Los Angeles.
0/0	Anyone who wants it ..they can have my dose! I'm not taking it... I don't feel the need to take a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.9 % survival rate
0/0	Anyone who wants to speed up their time up here on earth take the shot
0/0	Anyone who would trust the government is retarded and foolish. Conspiracy is the way the world is run why is it so hard to believe. People don‚Äôt know their history sadly. Tats why we all act so much like sheep !
0/0	Anyone with an ounce of common sense wouldn't want to be used as a guinea pig for a vaccine that was produced in such a short period of time.
1/1	Anyone without a brain says that you shouldnt get vaccinate. They are lying

1/0	Anything but the Chinese vaccines!
0/0	Anything phony Dr. Fauci recommends, I'd do the exact opposite.
0/0	Anything this political is a red flag for me! This whole affair feels like a worldwide military exercise. I ain't drinking the cool aide!
0/-1	Anytime a doctor says "There is no long term data" then you are taking a huge risk. They didn't even test this vaccine on lab rats.
0/0/0	Anywhere Bill gates shows up u know its sketchy idk but thats just me
0/-1	Apparently its not effective if you are French and aged above 65 or below 55 but works on everyone else very well.
1/0	Apparently one dose of both the Pfizer and Moderna ones are enough and that they should have marketed as one dose vaccines but can't now as the trials were based on 2 doses. It's a pity because it would speed things up.
0/0	Apparently some people think that getting a vaccine thats not 100 percent effective is a good idea.....
0/-1	Apparently the side effects are horrendous.
0/0	Apparently they don‚Äôt work since all these recent cases going up. Lmao
1/1	Applied to graduate, certified my rank list, and got my second #CovidVaccine today so I guess you could say I was productive!!!!!
1/1	Appreciated very helpful
1/1	Approximately 75% of Americans would agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19 if they received assurances about the safety of the vaccine
1/1	Aprove this already! I'm in this trial and 99.99% positive I got the placebo, but I'm slated to get the real deal once this goes green.
1/1	Are flu shots free for everyone or just select groups? I agree though, vaccination for most things should be a free public provided service
0/-1	Are medical freedom warriors being set up to be public enemy #1 after a future low uptake of the vax. Sting pullers can easily prolong this plandemic in order achieve more global reset objectives.
0/0	Are other illness more dangerous than this "Covid".......and until now we live with them and doesn't need to make Vaccin .......are pills for this SARS Cov .....
0/0	Are people allowed to question what is injected into them or is that going to be a criminal offence?

0/0	Are the people expected to take another experimental vaccine when China manufactures and releases another virus?
0/0	Are these vaccine drugs plant based? Organic? Vegan? Have they been tested on animals? Are there any non-organic or non-plant based ingredients in these vaccine drugs? What are the ingredients of these vaccine drugs?
0/0	Are these üêë lining up for the slaughter or üêê I have never üôà seen anything like this.

0/0	Are they getting paid to be guinea pigs from a experimental gene therapy?
1/1	Are vaccines good? Yes, beyond yes. Should everyone use vaccines? Yes.
1/1	Are vaccines safe? #Vaccines are now safer than ever before as they go through rigorous testing and development, subject to strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.
0/0	Are we going to talk about the side effects of the vaccines, what other diseases (not viruses) it might cause?
0/0	Are we ignoring the fact, these vaccines have aborted baby cells? I am really confused.
0/0	Are we really trusting a company that knew and still sold baby powder proven to cause cancer?
0/0	Are you SURE you want a covid vaccine? Because once you get it, there‚Äôs no taking it out of you and you will be permanently stuck with the adverse side effects
1/0	Are you going to get a vaccine for covid or are you still going to risk your life
0/-1	Are you guys going to make the rdif chip video too?
0/0	Are you nuts everyone takes the risks for everyone else and gets the vaccine? Everyone in my family who had Covid-19 didn't get sick with it. But we should take the risk and possibly get an adverse reaction to a vaccine. Anyone coming dictating to me or trying to stab me with a jab will be getting stabbed in the head.
0	Are you okay? NO! cause you will be dead after taking the vaccine!
1	Are you taking about the J&J SIX cases out of 7 MILLION that only affected WOMEN? I think you?l be fine

0/-1	Article in the Guardian today: only 57% of GPs have had the vaccine. I never need a doctor as I keep myself healthy, but if I did I'd be visiting a 43%er
1/1/1	As Americans get vaccinated, more parts of our lives are returning to normal. If you‚Äôve been delaying your plans in the housing market because of the pandemic, this is a great time to revisit those dreams. Call me with your questions today to take the 1st step toward your goals. https://t.co/vhxq85fXwI
1/1	As I already contracted COVID probably not right away as I'm already immune, but if it's mandatory for travelling Imma inject that shit ASAP.
0/-1	As I said in my book, we don't have a COVID-19 vaccine and may never. We have experimental biological agents using new mRNA technology that result in pathogenic priming & fertility issues and that do not stop transmission. Big Pharma immune from liability.
0/0	As I suspected...a vaccine was developed " too quickly " a rush to cure results in deaths...
1/-1	As I understand it, every state should be "all adults" by april 19 or sooner. My state will be all adults by the 16th , and I conveniently arrive on the 17th, so it should go fairly smoothly depending on appointment availability. I'm hoping I can get the J&J.
1/-1	As I‚Äôve been told by the anti-maskers all year, if you don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, stay home.
0/0	As Peter Hitchens quite rightly remarked: 'Face masks turn us into voiceless submissives - and it‚Äôs not science forcing us to wear them, it‚Äôs politics.'
0/0	As a African my ancestors never needed man made medecine. Nature made herbs only I dont eat man made food, I'm vegan.
1/1	As a Brit our vaccination procurement and delivery is probably the single competent thing that the government has managed during the pandemic.
1/1	As a Canadian - your response and action on getting vaccines out to the population is impressive! Everyone being within 5 miles of where to get a shot - awesome!
1/1	As a PA resident and only 32 years old I scheduled my first appointment while at my doctors today. My health care provider has opened up appointments to everyone.
1/1	As a Type 1 diabetic who spends 40-plus hours a week at @Cronkite_ASU, I was thrilled to receive my 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine early this morning. But I'm most grateful for the students I'm around every day who has been responsible, thoughtful and diligent to keep us safe.
0/0	As a black man in America, I'm gonna go ahead and opt out of the Tuskagee group and wait a bit before I commit to something like this.
0/0	As a doctor, I totally agree with your statement. I also have not taken the vaccine on this account, and my nurse who had prior covid infection had very severe side effects to the first dose of vaccine and we had to advise her against the 2nd dose.
1/1	As a funeral director, I just want to extend my thanks to the anti-vaxxers, you lot are really supporting the industry during these difficult times.
1/1	As a guy with autism, I am deeply offended. Bottom line is if you don‚Äôt vaccinate your kid they might die before their 5th birthday.
0/0	As a health care professional myself I will not get it.
0/0	As a health care worker. I won‚Äôt be getting it either.
0/0	As a healthcare worker, I will not be getting it, nor will my family
1/1/1/1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months. That'll be such a load off, especially since she runs a Covid clinic at the moment.
0	As a healthy 32 year old I'm getting pressured to take the vaccine. From what I've researched, if you've had covid you have the antibodies and don't need the vaccine. 2nd, getting the vaccine doesn't prevent you spreading the virus. I've been told things like "It's not for you, it's for everyone else." If I feel confident in my ability to fight off the virus naturally why would I get vaccinated? Since the vaccine actually only helps my symptoms, it should be a personal choice because the consequences are personal. Currently I don't see a reason why I should take it, and I certainly don't like that many events will require the vaccine to attend. Unless the vaccine van prevent the spread why so much pressure to get vaccinated?
1/-1	As a midwife I‚Äôm pro vaccine.. But have real concerns of this idea of compulsory vaccine and shaming individuals and communities.. Last I checked we lived in a free country.. Look what‚Äôs in front of you rather than inventing problems.. Bring people with you and do not alienate
1/1	As a nurse in a nursing home, most of our building got vaccinated at the end of December and as of this week we have no covid patients for the first time since March 2020!
0/0	As a passed middle aged adult with no underlying conditions, I will ALSO not get this shot!
0/0	As a person who has terrible adverse affects to flu vaccination and almost all doctors medications I guess I'm going to take my chances without a vaccine no matter how well it turns out.
1/1	As a person with autism, I find it incredibly curious some people would rather have a sick or dead child than an autistic one

0/0	As a pharmacist I have zero desire to get this vaccine. Thank you for being one of the very few to speak logic!

0/0	As an Adult...thankfully I have never had to take a vaccine...Not going to start now...I trust my immune system.
1/1	As an epidemiologist, I loved this. Is clear now that we will have to learn to live with the Covid. And sadly some many factors that helped for the Smallpox are long gone. We can only hope we can learn from this because is a matter of time for the next time.
1/1	As an under-30 who‚Äôs had a jab, this doesn‚Äôt concern me. There are always gonna be risks but I‚Äôd rather a 1 in a million chance of getting a blood clot than not have a 90% effective vaccine being administered at large.
0/0	As for me and my children. No thanks we will pass on an untested rushed vaccine with little to no information or liability. Nah fk that..

0/0	As long as I am alive, nobody is getting this vaccine in me.
1/1	As long as not from China
0/0	As long as the companies making the vaccines are shielded by a no liability clause, nobody should take the vaccine. ANY company should be held responsabile for the product or service it provides
1/1	As long as they're safe. They have to be safe while you rush through to get them out!
1/1	As made apparent by some of the comments, we have a strange amount of anti vaxxers in society. It‚Äôs surprising considering that without vaccines and modern medicine, many of us wouldn‚Äôt have made it to adulthood. Try not to let conspiracies override commonsense.
1/-1	As much as I recommend the vaccine I applaud you and support your decision, nobody should be forced to take it and you have to do what you believe is the right thing for you no matter what anyone else thinks or says.
0/0	As much as I'm glad that a vaccine is being used. I'm scared about the long-term health effects of a rushed vaccine.
1/1	As of April 18 I'll be 2 months fully vaccinated. Still feeling good. Wish the vaccine could have gotten rid of allergies. Maybe given me some more arms since I'm a Pharmacy Technician and we are SLAMMED daily between doing Covid testing, Covid vaccines and our normal every day stuff. Even fully staffed we struggle
0/0	As predicted, they have been telling the public that we must start planning for a "permanent pandemic". That alone should let you know its a hoax. But of course, nothing sets the masses off course from being obedient serfs
0/0	As safe as the Titanic .
0/0	As somebody who has been working in the pharmaceutical industry for 5+ years and the last 4 of it in Clinical Trials. There's a reason why it takes 4yrs to get approved and for that reason i'm bowing out of taking the vaccine for at least a year.
1	As someone in education I'd feel its irresponsible not to try my beat to keep the kids safe
0/0	As someone who already had COVID. Why would I get the vaccine? When, 1. Getting COVID twice is very rare. 2. Even if you get COVID, your chances of dying are like 0.000001%. 3. I got a negative test and am no longer contagious.
1/1	As someone who got the vaccine and someone who loves pop culture, I think of the vaccine and virus in terms of old western movies. Imagine there is a bounty, and a bounty hunter sees a wanted poster for the bounty. People see the warrant as well then see the actual person from the bounty and immediately know that‚Äôs the person to stop. That‚Äôs basically more or less how the vaccine works against the virus and how your body more or less responds when coming into contact with the actual virus
1/1	As someone who had blood clots in my legs in my early 20s from birth control pills, I'll take any vaccine you'll give me.
0/1	As someone who has first hand experience of this, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs frustrating to watch people who make decisions to not get vaccinated based on falsehoods.
0/0	As someone who has had COVID twice I will pass...It‚Äôs the same as the flu shot it‚Äôs a choice I don‚Äôt pass judgement on those that vaccinate because it‚Äôs their body their choice...we never judged those who decline a flu shot so why judge about COVID! I have a child that had severe allergic reaction to flu shot the one time we said yes and I say no to COVID....don‚Äôt let‚Äôs others decision to vax or not vax be what makes your decision do it for yourself!
1/1/1	As someone who has studied viruses and worked in research labs on other coronaviruses like MERS-cov and SARS-cov, it makes me laugh to hear Erika say "that's not a risk she's willing to take" because the risks of the disease are far more dangerous than the worst risks of the vaccine.
1/1	As someone who wants myself and my family to take the vaccine, I welcome this news.
1/0	As someone with disability and no immune system, I probably can't get the vaccine since I'm unable to get the flu shot. I've been self isolating on and off for six years. Ive only left my house about a handful of times. We should be listening to people who know about these things. Thank you to the man who said getting the vaccine not for themselves but people they don't know; that's people like me. We are all scared. Please think of others and not just yourself.
1/1	As soon as I can get this vaccine I will be rolling up my sleeve. A day or two of flu like symptoms is better than 3 weeks on a ventilator.
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement.
1/1	As soon as I can, yes. Obviously immunocompromosed, elderly, and frontline workers come first but I‚Äôve been in quarantine three times this year. I‚Äôm sick of it.
1/1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1/1	As soon as it‚Äôs available on the NHS, I will be happy to have it.
1/1	As soon as it‚Äôs opened up to cancer patients here in Alberta you can bet I will be getting this vaccine with no concerns!
1/1	As soon as my governor said that essential workers would be able to get the Covid vaccine, I hurried to the website to book my vaccine appointment. Tomorrow, I will have reached immunity from the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine.
1/1	As soon as people can‚Äôt get on a plane to Benidorm without a vaccine you‚Äôll see a dramatic increase in the uptake.
1/1	As soon as they say I can take mine I‚Äôll gladly go get it.
0/0	As supervisor of a district heavily impacted by COVID, I am deeply concerned that despite overwhelming evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy there remains a debate around the value of getting vaccinated ... It is our responsibility.
0/-1	As the "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise, they realize it would be a war crime to vaccinate the prisoners. That's why they aren't doing it.
0/-1	As the scripture says: Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. Luke 17:33 KJV
0/0	As the scripture says: Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. Luke 17:33 KJV Many will take covid-19 vaccine thinking they are saving themselves but the truth is they will be doomed forever. WAIT AND SEE!!!, LET HE WHO HAS EARS HEAR FROM THE LORD

1/0/1	As the vaccine become available, be prepared to see a lot more anti-vaxx posts and shares. Be careful to ensure your information comes from a credible website. It‚Äôs normal to be worried but vaccination is the only way out of this.
1	As the vaccine becomes available many people might feel they should not get it. But as suggested in the article, by getting it you could take care of your family in the event someone in your house gets sick.
0/1	As they are the most vulnerable, and there's a shortage, they'll perhaps have enough of the Pfizer for them. If not, the German state will have a lower bill for the old-age pensions in a few months time.
0/-1	As they get their fake shot they laugh at the dumb people that believe its man kinds savior
0/0	As they increase the vaccine shots . The more cases of covid increases ! The people were told , wash hands , wear masks , lock downs , close business , 6feet social distancing and don't see family members because this can increase your risk of getting exposed ! Now let's inject you with a virus straight into your bloodstream ?!? This is now good for you ?!? The people getting vaccinated are becoming walking Petri dishes and helping to infect health people in the public .
1/1	As they should. And once the vaccine is widely available, they should require all passengers to show proof of vaccination or medical waiver.
0/0	As usual, Dement*a Joe Biden does not know what he is talking about!!! My body my choice
1/1	As we distribute more vaccine, we‚Äôre getting closer to beating this pandemic.
1/1	As we face compounding crises, I am feeling very blessed to have received my 2nd #COVID19Vaccine dose today. I encourage everyone to roll up your sleeve when your time comes. #VaccinesWork
1/1	As you are a vital health care worker, I hope you have either already been vaccinated or gotten an appointment to get one in the next few days, SD.
0/0	Aside from the sophistry of wearing masks, I WILL NOT take any #COVID19 #vaccine. ZERO of the normally mandated Phase 4 (long-term side effect) studies done (usually 6-10 years). Using fear as a tool illustrates the disingenuous nature of those controlling the population.
1/-1	Ask 1000 people whether they would want to vaccinate. 500 says no The press: half of Britons don't want a vaccination
0/0	Ask me in a year what I think about this experiment vaccine? Because I‚Äôm not taking it.
1/1	Aspirin has side effects u all gonna stop taking that too?
0/-1	Associate Professor Mary-Ann Davies tells me that the most common #covishield vaccine side-effects are: 1. Pain in the area where the injection has been administered 2. Mild flu and a bit of nausea or dizziness
0/0	Astra Zeneca Vaccines have been stopped in Denmark and other European countries due to reported blood clots!
0/0	AstraZeneca is useless!!
1/1/-1/1	AstraZeneca says it aims to have a ‚Äònext generation‚Äô Covid vaccine ready for use in the autumn which will incorporate some of the mutated variants of concern. Work well underway to design new vaccine structure at Oxford.
1/1/1/1/1	AstraZeneca seems to be more effective and researched. It seems promising and not rushed. I'll wait on them.
1/1	AstraZeneca would be my choice for sure.
0/1	Astrazeneca covishield. Just a bit of arm soreness and fatigue the next day.
1/1	Astrazeneca. Arm was a bit sore for two days. Have to have the second shot next month
0	At 1 point there were only 6 deaths from Covid as well. Just because they only found 6 doesn't mean there aren't any more.
1/1	At BKC jumbo Covid centre I and my wife got 2nd dose of Covishield under dean Dr. Dere. We record our appreciation for excellent arrangements made by all the staff working at spread over makeshift centre under able supervision of Dr. Dere.
1/1	At a rate of about 2 per million.No medical procedure is without risk.But the vaccine risk is far outweighed by the much greater risk from covid.
1/1	At first I was against the JJ vaccine but when you realize it can keep you out of the hospital and prevent death I said ok. So that's what I got.
1/1	At last my Dad has been given the #vaccine so relieved
1/-1	At least 90% of the comments here look like they've been written by Neanderthals without an education.
0/-1	At least I will not be having any vaccine side effects since I will not be taking it. EVER
0/0	At least the USA is ethical enough to stop roll out after clotting events in order to spare other countries, Great Britain rolled AZ vaccine out anyway despite of many complications and clotting incidents with the vaccine in several countries.
1/1	At least three-quarters of residents in most U.S. skilled nursing facilities had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Keep up the great work.
1/1	At least we know there is a vaccine that works.
1/1	At least your body won't turn into a coronavirus duplication factory if you get successfully vaccinated.
1/1	At my hospital only 40% of our staff have been vaccinated. It‚Äôs so disheartening. We‚Äôve had the vaccine since December 18th. I signed up the very minute the appointments were available.
1/-1	At some point it has to be personal responsibility
1/-1	At some point someone had to say it. Your an asshole cause it‚Äôs not about you it‚Äôs about giving it to others
0/0	At the highest levels of the medical cartel, vaccines are a top priority because they cause a weakening of the immune system. I know that may be hard to accept, but its true. The medical cartel, at the highest level, is not out to help people, it is out to harm them, to weaken them. To kill them. At one point in my career, I had a long conversation with a man who occupied a high government position in an African nation. He told me that he was well aware of this. He told me that WHO is a front for these depopulation interests
1/1	At the moment we have only vaccines. To find medicines needs more time. We have to return at our life, and to do it, all the world have to be vaccinated. At the moment is the only way to get out from the pandemic.
0/0	At the same time it's killing some people.
0/0	At the same time you face legal consequences for not taking the vaccine, there are NO legal consequences for recklessly and fraudulently manufacturing a vaccine like J&J got caught doing with 14M doses. 14M doses with the wrong ingredient is not a mistake, that‚Äôs fraud. And what‚Äôs the consequences? Nothing. Nothing at all...
0/-1	At the same time, many people are ambivalent because, while they want to protect themselves against infection, they also fear possible side effects from vaccination.
0/-1	At this moment I had a message from my friend from someone she know after he took the vaccine and had a stroke he is 23y
1/1	At this point, I would rather get the AstraZeneca vaccine on an airplane while on birth control than get COVID.
1/1	At this point, the question has to be how many people are going to be co winners of a Nobel prize. Three viable vaccines this week, a year after sars-covid2 was even discovered. Phenomenal.
0/0	At this rate the EU will be recommending an Asprin with hot chocolate as a vaccination!
1/1	At this rate, everyone will be vaccinated by the end of 2021. Hopefully the rate continues to go up.
0/-1	At what month or year after taking a vaccine for Covid do you become sterile or your health deteriorates until death? And by then nobody will question or even think about you being sterile or have died because of the vaccine you took a few months or years ago. The pushers of the vaccines response? In public, "we didnt know" In private, "Mission accomplished"
1/-1	At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said ‚ÄúThe mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can‚Äôt be pro life and pro vax at the same time.‚Äù A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/1	Augurs well. Soon all the states will be Covid free.
1/1	Autism isn't something you acquire, it's something you're born with.
0/0	Autism was never heard of in the scientific community until they started administrating vaccines in the 30's.
1/1/1/1	Average age of my hospitalized COVID patients today is ~40 years (compared to 70 years a few months ago). Soft reminder to all the young people still undecided about the COVID vaccine. Hospital isn‚Äôt a good meeting point. Get your vaccine please.
0	Aw shit dem vaccines fuckin up
1/-1	Awaiting final effectiveness results of SputnikV vaccine üòå
1/1	Awake at 4.00 am after getting my oxford and feel awful. Chills and shivers, though I'm sure it's not as bad as covid 19 üôè.
1/-1	Awesome
1/1	Awesome news but to truly end this nightmare we need to make sure the entire world is vaccinated so variants are not spread around the globe!
1/1	Awesome will be so happy when my grandkids can get their vaccines
1/-1/-1	Awesome!
1/1	Awesome! I am really happy for you!
1/1	Awesome! I can‚Äôt wait to get a COVID vaccine someday!
1/1	Awesome! Putting together a series on mRNA vaccines right now debuting later this week!
1/1	Awesome! Reasonable people will take it, idiots will rebel against it, the disease will take its course and maybe we‚Äôll be left with a better world after.
1/1	Awesome! We won't have another summer ruined!
1/1	Awesome!! We all get vaccinated too!!
1/-1	Awesome!!! I can‚Äôt wait inject that shit!
1/1	Awesome, I'll take 1 vaccine and $1400.00. Honestly, just make the vaccine available, I really hate that organization of nationwide distribution has been such shit.
1/1	Awesome, JR! I just got my first today, Moderna! :)
1/1	Awesome, cant wait to get my first covid shot and get back to living
1/1	Awesome. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed now. I‚Äôll continue to wear a mask as long as our society asks us to, because I‚Äôm not an asshole and my fellow citizens have no way of knowing I‚Äôm fully vaxxed. But my N95s are getting retired...
1/1	Awesome. Started my moderna today too
1/1	Ayyy, just got my first dose of the vaccine Let‚Äôs GOOOOOOOO
1/1	Az is safe and effective and covid is deadly
1/1	BBC is always quality, good information about the vaccine. Hope everyone takes it. I hope to get it in May
0/0	BBC lies 89% of the time according to top scientists
0/0	BEWARE!! What is good news about SKIPPING TESTING?? It's not going to "put this to bed"!!! i was flu vaccine injured in 2012 - in short, it took me 3 years to be able to use a fork and a knife again to eat. it was horrific, the worst experience of my entire life. I am now disabled, will never work again and have permanent neurological damage - I have constant neuropathic pain. it took EIGHT YEARS to go thru the "Vaccine Court" process only to win a fraction of my losses. If you are damaged by the COVID vaccine, you are screwed. You are not protected and you will be damaged. If you get the flu, you won't die!!! If you do, it's your time. I would rather have died than live the life I have with constant pain, unable to do things I love, unable to work. My condition will worsen as I age and I will suffer more and more and more. DON'T GET THE VACCINE!!

0/0	Bad vaccine
1/1	Barbados PM Mia Mottley: Barbados to receive first shipment of 100,000 doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shortly from India - this would vaccinate 50,000 persons as it is two doses each; hope to start deployment in "very near future"
1/1	Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to a person trying to become pregnant in the short or long term
1/1	Based on what I know the only side effect of vaccines is a child crying because they‚Äôre afraid of needles
1/1	Based on what has been proved about vaccines for other diseases, the COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus
1/1	Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases and early data from clinical trials, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19
1/1	Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases and early data from clinical trials, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19.
0/0	Basically what she's saying, using WAY too many words is, we have this stuff we're going to inject you with and we have absolutely NO idea if it will help or if it will do anything at all. In reality, it's no more than a placebo to give people a false sense of safety.
0/0	Basically what they're saying is "We have no idea about the long-term health risks and in any case we won't be held accountable but just trust us and get the jab
0/0	Basically what they're saying is "We have no idea about the long-term health risks and in any case we won't be held accountable but just trust us and get the jab"
0/0	Bastards. Stay away with the poison
0/0	Be careful guys. There is not enough research to know the long term effects of this vaccine.
0/0	Be safe don't take it
0/0	Be smart let other people do it first and take it last just in case they turn into zombies
0/0	Be sure to read the side effects!! I‚Äôll take my chances with the virus; a 99% plus recovery rate.
1/1	Beauty! Congrats to Germany, the vaccination machine is now really starting to get going. A much more normal summer is in sight for so many countries.
0/0	Because 1) bill gates made it himself with the promise of getting rid of 15% of the population approximately as he stated before that the world is overpopulated 2) you don't need it as survival rate for the virus is over 99% if it even exists 3) vaccines are toxic, especially ones made by psychotic elites who once upon a time went to inject people in poor countries and crippled and killed some of them. Need I go on..
1/1	Because 1.4 million deaths are too many. Let‚Äôs stop this madness
0/0	Because 95% effifacy rate was fake. It was tested by Pfizer and Moderna themselves. It was B737 Max part 2.0
0/0/-1	Because I don‚Äôt want to have it, end of.
1/1	Because I know enough science to know that getting the vaccine is a MUCH better bet than getting COVID. In all likely hood you will be getting it soon yourself, do you really think that we will allow disease carrying morons to wander around loose for ever?
0/0	Because I've got lots of common Sense, a good immune system, and I don't really want to play any part in gates' gene therapy experiment.
0/0/0/0	Because as one doctor said "its not a V@c. Its gene manipulation" humans are the lab rats in this new test..
1/0	Because her daughter can‚Äôt get vaccinated, she should be begging everyone else to get vaccinated.
1/1	Because in the end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) avoided Trump‚Äôs attempts to play politics with our safety. Thank you to the FDA career professionals
0/0	Because it doesn't work, FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY...VACCINE RUSHED TO PISH POLITICAL AGENDA, MORE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND DIE BC OF IGNORANCE AND SELFLESSNESS
0/0	Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe. This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
0/0	Because it took them less than a year to develop it. Seems a bit fishy, like they had covid planned.
1/1	Because it will be a communal and healing experience: to wait our turn, to make sure the people who need it the most get it first, to do something as a country all at once, to watch the herd immunity build in all of us. To crush this bug, we need to all do it together
0	Because it's NOT natural 100%. This virus clearly has been engineered in a lab. And now is behaving like a biological weapon. Even the OMS hasn't ruled this out yet.
1/0	Because not all the vulnerable CAN be vaccinated, as shown in this very news item. There's no proof yet that the vaccine doesn't reduce your ability to infect others.
0/0	Because not everyone thinks it's a miracle... some people think its damaging ... I'm not getting it unless I see there are no side effects....
1/1	Because of your advice and videos doctor I was able to convince my mom and father in law to take vaccine thanks doctor
0	Because of your timing to announce this after the election, me and about 70 million other Americans will boycott Pfizer for eternity
0/0	Because so many are having bad reactions and I have many allergies I think I will opt out until more is known about these drugs.
0/0	Because the long term effects of these vaccines are impossible to assess because it hasn't been tested long term. That's undeniable.
0/1	Because the mRNA approach to vaccines is new, you might have seen claims and worries about what might happen after it‚Äôs injected into the body.
0/0	Because the one sell vaccine is the one who created the virus.. Booom
1/1/1	Because the virus is a lot worse. There is no reason to believe that these vaccines will persist in the body beyond a few weeks let alone months. I‚Äôm not saying they will be 100% safe, people might have all sorts of strange reactions to it, but if I can stop this virus from spreading and killing thousands of old people I will. Even if there is little risk from the virus to me. We take many bigger risks every day than this vaccine. have you ever read the ingredients list on your food? there are more untested chemical mixes in the latest alcopop than a vaccine.
1/1	Because there are still people stupid enough to avoid a life saving vaccine?
0/0	Because there is a good risk assessment for the contraceptive pill before it is prescribed individually, unlike the vaccine
0/0	Because they are all equally useless. Except for giving you strokes.
1/0	Because they are still requiring mask, the whole point of the vaccine is to stop this madness
0/-1	Because they have started to wake up and feel inner strength...........No way any government can stop this.
0/-1	Because why take an unproven, experimental vaccine that doesn't prevent Covid-19, where we're being told that we would STILL need to wear a mask and social distance even after getting it!?
1/1/1	Been Covid positive twice already,have auto immune disease and had my first dose of covid jab! Hurrah! I'm still alive!
1/1	Been on a trial. With this vaccine. No problems. Little side effects, glad to hear all these news updates. A very powerful vaccine. Glad to have been on the trial with synexus
1/1	Before about two centuries when the first vaccine-smallpox - the "smartpants" of that era used to believe that we will all turn into calfs and we will growl and other! Its like it hasnt passed a day.........!
0/0	Before even watching, I knew the goal of this video: "Find uneducated people who don't want the vaccine for stupid reasons." This way, viewers who don't think critically will falsely conclude everyone who refuses to get it is doing so for stupid reasons.
0/0	Before vaccination: risk of infection After vaccination: infected. Great way to speed up the process. Let‚Äôs all go get infected shall we! Said no one EVER.
1/1	Beginning of the end.... of the pandemic*
1/-1	Being a celebrity doesn‚Äôt mean you are exempt from COVID-19 rules. Follow the guidelines, Keep others and yourself safe, Wash your hands (20 seconds minimum), Wear your mask... Get your vaccine!!
1/1	Being anti vax is like choosing to swim across a crocodile infested river instead of using the bridge because you're scared of the bridge collapsing
0/0	Being hesitant about Covid vaccination is a perfectly valid position. Not everyone is convinced that these vaccines are safe, and the "efficacy" data is still very limited.
1/1	Being in the last-priority category for a vaccine is really nerve-wracking rn ......
1/1	Being part of the solution
0/0	Being pumped full of who knows what, still they wouldn‚Äôt be liable, so keep injecting and tell them it‚Äôs good for them, they believed the plandemic, they‚Äôll believe anything we tell them too!!
0/0	Being pumped full of who knows what, still they wouldn‚Äôt be liable, so keep injecting and tell them it‚Äôs good for them, they believed the plandemic, they‚Äôll believe anything we tell them too!!!

1/-1	Berkeley researchers have now found 20 compounds that in combination with remdesivir, are much better than remdesivir alone in protecting human lung cells from SARS-CoV-2
1/1	Best News ever! My mum has been shielding since 23 March 2020 apart from short stint back at work Aug-Dec she‚Äôs not left the house, been shopping or socialised for 12 months. On Monday she has her 1st dose COVID vaccine. This has made my 2021. Thank you #NHS
0/0	Best advice I can give is try and dodge this for at least another 2 years. If it means no hols abroad then so be it, small price to pay.
1/-1	Best get it approved soon. I‚Äôve got a life to live here... couldn‚Äôt even give a toss about this virus now
1/1	Best if EU gets it's own and we will have our 5 vaccines for ourselves lovely
1/1	Best thing I‚Äôve read in a VERY long time: my COVID-19 Vaccine Card!
0/0	Best thing to do, is not take it
1	Best vaccine so far with effective results
0/0	Best vaccine, stop eating processed food, exercise, do intermittent fasting and get a little sun light (without sun screen).
1/1	Bet the anti vax mob will all say the virus just disappeared of its own accord when mass vaccination protects them
0/0	Better because this vaccine is not safe. More dangerous than covid
1/1	Better chance to get hit by lightning. Vaccines will bring us out of this pandemic and bring life back to normal.
1/1	Better do that's the only reason I got the jab
0/1	Better for you than any of the vaccines is to actually get the Coronavirus and let your body build up a better immunity to it.
0/0	Better get your shot,British covid baby and Africa Ebola Covid baby could meet up and bring forth Godzilla's revenge. Or World war Z. I admit I've watched that movie a few times this last year. Prep work. Keep your vaccine, I never touch the stuff. Ever..
0/0	Better name would be the "Roulette V". Wait and see.
0/0	Better not use people without their consent as guinea pigs
0/0	Better pray than getting the vaccine.
1/-1	Better than Johnson&Johnson
1/1	Better than having Covid: I did and went to hospital. Not nice BUT I was lucky! I AM having the vaccine TODAY. I STRONGLY advise people to have it.
1/1	Better than nothing for now.
0/0	Better to drink bleach. It kills everything.
0/0	Better to fight off a virus naturally with a 99.99% recovery rate than to chance a rushed vaccine that we can't even get direct answers about.. one has a clue about
0/1	Better vaccinate and certificate of Malaria cos it killing more people especially the younger children than Covid-19 In my country
0/0	Beware of the wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, the governments cure may be worse than the virus.

1/1	Beyond grateful to all the staff involved in vaccination clinic in Connolly Hospital. Phenomenal roll out
0/0	Biden gets injected with sterile water
1/1	Biden pledges free Covid vaccine for 'everyone' in US if elected, this is surely something positive right?
1	Biden said he wants to be at 100 million vaccinated in his first 100 days in office, we are currently at 1.34 million a day so I think he will surpass that goal. It should be noted that we were doing 900k a day when he was inaugurated but a roughly 67% increase in 2 weeks is still good to see
0/0	Biden will make the vaccine mandatory! Then he will talk about Corn Pop!
1/0	Biden's cautious approach should BOLSTER public confidence in our vaccine protocols.
1/1	Biden's vaccine deployment has been great.
1/1	Biden, Kamala, and Pence got theirs almost immediately just to name a few.
0/0	Big Pharma can't cure cancer or diabetes (because there is no money in it...they make more keeping you alive and treating you) but they develop Covid vaccines in months? Who is paying for this? Why is it profitable and curing diabetes is not?
0/0	Big Pharma has ZERO LIABILITY. That tells you everything anybody needs to know.
0/-1	Big Tech and all of its inconsistencies on display. Again, again and again!
0/0	Big deals. It's likely to be as toxic as AZ, Moderna, Pfizer and the chinese crap. BIG DEAL!!!
0/-1	Big game!
1/1	Big heap of THANKS to the scientists who got to work quickly and, hopefully, we will see this pandemic end in a couple of years.
1/1	Big news for a #COVID19 treatment developed at Rockefeller: the university has entered a licensing agreement with @bmsnewsvto advance development of a monoclonal antibody cocktail that preclinical studies suggest can effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2.
0/0	Big pharma has every confidence in the vaccine that's why they took out a "can not get sued" rule if anyone dies from it.
0/0	Big pharma is laughing all the way to the bank.
0/0	Big pharma paid millions for this propaganda.
0/0	Big pharma trying to control the common cold/flu seasons, AS IF they could ever never be. Allopathy have NO PLACE inside a HOMEOpathic environment

0/0/0	Bigger group of groupthink dummies I don't think I've seen in a while! Sitting outside wearing their ridiculous masksü§£ü§£ You all enjoy your shots! üòÜ
1/1	Biggest takeaway: I hope that people feel even more reassured about vaccine safety, because they see how quickly, carefully & transparently our regulatory agencies are.
0/0	Bill Gates flowwing through your veins good Luck ill watch,
0/0	Bill Gates has enough money to end world hunger instead he is creating more vaccines! Coincedence?
0/1	Bill Gates once said that the population was headed to 9 billion, and that ‚Äúif we do a really good job with vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 to 15 percent.‚Äù That would equate to 900 million to 1.35 billion less people.
0/0	Bill Gates vaccine is killing a lot of People in Africa...Please Help !!!!!!! Don't take the vaccine #TheGreatReset
0/0	Bill Gates was the one pushing the 'vaccines', he also has dealings with the lab where this virus came from. Let that sink in. I owe you nothing and my life is fine, I don't have a desperate need to go to the pub or travel abroad.

0/0	Bite me! VACCINES ARE POISON!
0/0/0	Bla Bla Bla. . Keep scaring the sheep into getting the vaccine
1/1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
1/1/1/1	Bless the scientists who worked so hard to get us these vaccines within a year!! So astonishing
1/1	Bless you WHO, I cant wait to take the vaccine

1/1	Booked my vaccine!!
0/0	Booster I'm not taking the first give mine to someone who wants it
0/0	Boosters and annual vaccinations. Big pharma having an absolute field day with this scamdemic.
1/1	Both Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines use an mRNA platform, found their vaccines to be about 95% effective. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine showed a somewhat lower efficacy, but is less expensive and poses fewer issues involved in distribution and administration
1/1	Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19.
1/1	Both doses only made my arm super sore for 2 days each. Some people I work with have had zero reaction to either shot
1/1	Both my grandparents took the 1st dose a few weeks ago (my grandmother even takes insulin injections ) They are both fine
1/1	Both my parents got their first #COVIDVaccination today and 2021 feels just a little brighter to me.
1/1	Both my parents got vaccinated this morning Mum said it was so well organised and everyone involved was lovely
1/1	Both my parents have had their first jab. Both rough for 24 hours after it. Ill be having it as soon as I'm allowed
1/1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are investigating
1/1	Both of my elderly parents have got the vaccine. So relieved I could cry.
1/1	Both of my parents got vaccinated with both doses with pfizer i am so happy that they are finally protected!
1/1	Both of my parents have had at least their first dose and it's a huge relief!
1/1	Both parents getting their first #vaccination tomorrow .....finally ! Haven't seen them since last July. As soon as we are allowed I will be heading West.
1/1	Both parents were vaccinated and there were no side effects
1/-1	Both shots of Pfizer gave me a sore arm. Second shot gave me fatigue.
1/1	Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have completed phase three trials that were far larger (30k and 44k respectively) and more robust than almost any vaccine that has come before so I‚Äôd say you should stay away from the keyboard and not write anything about something you obviously have ZERO understanding of.
1/1	Both vaccine delivery & electoral college vote same day on Monday! What grateful 2 gifts! It must comes from Santa Claus!
1/0	Bottom line is you can have safety or you can have speed you cant have both when it comes to vaccines!

1/-1	Bring it on I'm up 4 it
1/1	Bring it on big fella the faster we all get vaccinated the faster we will be able to travel again and enjoy uninterrupted quality time with our families wherever they may be. Well done Australia let‚Äôs make Aussie the number one country where everyone who can be vaccinated is vaccinated for herd immunity
1/1/1	Bring it on!!! The slight risk of some kind of reaction is worth it knowing my grandad will be safe in my presence.
1/1	Bring the vaccine out and end the coronavirus
1/-1	Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines with 2 different mechanisms (Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc) are combined in a two-shot schedule.
0/0	Bro they can‚Äôt even find a vaccine for some cancers and aids yet they find vaccine for COVID so fast.It gives-me new world order vibes.......
1/1/1	Bro why even talk to anti vaxers if they want to die let them
1/1/1	Brother just got his second dose today and my SIL gets hers later this week. Just wish I could get the jab but I get to wait a bit longer.
0/0/0/0/1/0/0	Bruh at this point, people would rather live in the walking dead than to take this
0/1	Bruh my mom is making me get the covid vaccine in 2 hours
0/0	Buck parker seriously. Info from cnn. Yeah no. There's doctors who say dont get it because of way better reasons than cnn. But at least you has good reasons
1/1	Bullshit everywhere, vaccine is OK to take
0/0	But a total of 23 deaths have been reported out of 25000 people vaccinated. That's sounds worse than what the corona virus death rates are.
1/1	But any vaccine is better than covid without vaccine right? If it is effective against serious illnesses and death then what is the problem?
0/0	But as a 30 year old adult who is highly dubious about the whole Covid thing and especially the super fast creation of a vaccine . No i won't .
0	But but the best doctor in the world rOBERT kENNEDY said it contains nanoparticles that will make you into a robot
0/0	But can‚Äôt make a vaccination that prevent cancers and incurable sexual diseases ?
0/0	But didn't pfizer just publish a new study where they were testing other variants, with some arguably more deadly?
0/0	But do u know the long term effects? Do you know? Look at the hpv vaccine
0/-1	But even as vaccines are being rolled out, there‚Äôs little agreement on the exact sequence of priority groups.
1/1	But first, let‚Äôs talk about the second dose real quick. The second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine got to me.
1/0	But high school drop-out Jenny McCarthy says vaccines are bad!
1/0	But if four people with Covid had died of heart attacks and old age you can bet that it would have been attributed exclusively to Covid and not the preexisting conditions. When people die from vaccines suddenly it's all about the preexisting conditions
0/0	But if the virus mutates then the vaccine will be inneffective. With viruses, mutation is very common. It can take days only.
0/0	But in the 21st century and under a powerful supposed drug industry led health services ... he had under lying conditions? In UK 60000 deaths THEY SAY from covid ... that they can't even prove exists? Independent well respected laboratories in America failed to find ANY covid in 1500 tested positive but did find Influenza! Did you know that such as Diabetes and some cancers etc are CAUSED by the Epstein Barre Virus that doctors don't want to talk about ? I was told for 30myears to live with it and take mountains of antibiotics ... until an holistic Canadian doctor in USA told me that can be dealt with and promptly did so ... 4 weeks of taking a mix of certain herbs! If you have any condition that you are living with ... get tested for EBV! Doctors all too often LIE and those advising government are doing just that in order too make billions from those fake chinese vaccines!
0/0	But it is said to be 52% effective from what I heard from Prof Gray yesterday. What exactly do we want from this vaccine, is it not to protect us from covid19 and all its different variants?
0/0/-1	But it really might not be safe. Normally vaccines have lots more testing. It‚Äôs amazing that it‚Äôs here, but don‚Äôt forget to be careful.
1/1	But it's the dumb people who refuse to take vaccines, so the vaccine for dumbness wouldn't be taken by the people who need it.
1/1/1	But my coworkers say that the vaccines still have the same death rate as the virus. First off I dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths. Second where do these people get their "information "?
0/-1	But now the left can‚Äôt wait to have their vaccines. I still remember when kommila was adamant about not taking it because it‚Äôs ‚Äútrumps vaccine‚Äù.
0/0	But now they have the gull to tell us we need to take a vaccine for a low-threat virus? I can't believe people are actually defending this shit.
1/1	But scientists remain confident it will protect against serious disease.' And that's exactly who we should be listening to to. Not the small study as stated above.
0/-1	But that woman with bleach poisoning was doing what the government told her to do. Just like the vaccine. Being an NPC is dangerous, isn't it?
1/1	But that's what thousands of people are doing for us right now to try and find you a vaccine without side affects that works.
0/0	But the drugs companies want a profit and the politicians want a quick fix. So long term testing goes out the window. Caution is thrown to the wind.
1/1	But the people who can't take the vaccine, due to a bad immune system, can die if not enough people take it. This is not about us as individuals, it is about humanity as a whole.
0/0	But they are the first mRNA vaccines. Really a coincident? I would expect some mRNA vaccines for other preventable diseases before this one.
0/-1	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/0	But they or someone they live with might get sick from a virus or bacteria that they picked up around the time they got vaccinated.
0/0	But they said it was safe !!!!!
1/0	But to be fair studies have shown vaccines cause autism. Because you need to be alive to get it
1/1	But vaccines aren‚Äôt just for yourself. The main reason we get vaccines is so we don‚Äôt spread it to others who may be as risk to whatever it is you get the vaccine for. The fact that you‚Äôre worried about yourself instead shows how self centered you are.
1/1	But vaccines will soon make a big difference to transmission, where billions of doses will be available over the next few months
0/0	But wait I thought this vaccine was the miracle cure hense the reason your making millions of people be your test dummies for it‚Ä¶
0/0	But wait, Joe said he had a plan..no nevermind, he doesn't..but wait, the vaccine is the answer, nope, wrong again...masks work, ummm, well, questionable at best....oh I know, lockdowns, surely THAT will do the trick, well sh!t, wrong again! So are the days of our lives....üòÇü§∑ü§¶
1/1	But we can't even get appointments for elderly in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. We are still in phase 1 a because there aren't enough vaccines here. Please step in and help Pennsylvania.
0/-1	But what happens to your immortal soul when you take this genetically induced vaccine?
1/1	But you are not talking about the real issue about these vaccines, their availability for every single human being on the planet, currently these vaccines are not even accessible to half of the global population on Earth because, they are very expensive to afford, it sucks...
0/0	But you cannot sue for damages. That should tell you everything.
0/0	But you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better than getting Covid when a third have no symptoms and the vast majority of the rest have mild symptoms - I‚Äôve had Covid twice now and only had a mild cough. I won‚Äôt be having the vaccine. I‚Äôm not anti vax but i am pro safety-too many unknowns for me
1/1	But.....once everyone who wants one has access to it, who cares? Let the skeptics and the paranoid anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists learn the hard way.
1/1	Buuuut... yes, it's 85%+ effective against ALL of the new strains... so get vaccinated!
0/0/0	By CDC's own numbers recovery rates are higher than the vaccine effectiveness. ...I'll pass
1	By February end all 'interested' healthcare workers would have taken shot. Rest will do so as & when they wish in future. Govt. has done its part of vaccinating them on priority. Time now to shift focus on other frontline workers.
1/1/1/1	By God I never thought I'd see the day
1/1	By God‚Äôs grace, I got the CoviShield-AstraZeneca vaccine today. It‚Äôs a relief since I‚Äôll be living again with my 94-year-old grandma in 2 weeks.
0/1	By all means feel free not to have the vaccine but at least have the decency to accept the science and statistics...Oh yes, and also accept the fact I think you are a moron for not having it because you are! ;)
1/1	By not getting the vaccine you put other people, including your loved ones, at risk. This is as reckless as drunk driving.
0/0/0	By pausing the vaccine, they are telling us the vaccine may be more harmful than the virus (according to Emergency Use Authorization guidelines). Either the J&J vaccine is worse than they tell us or the virus is not nearly as bad as they tell us.
0/0	By rasing your vibrational frequency with the emotion of love, the immune system will be golden.
1/1	By rejecting a vaccine, Trump voters are naturally selecting themselves out of the gene pool. Thanks be to them
0/1	By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
0/0	By taking that vaccine you still won't be protected! You don't even know the risk!
0/0	By taking the vaccination your still not protected!you don't even know the risk
1/1	By the time I get it it'll have been more than a year since I last saw my mum, so after getting injected I'll be heading directly to the airport.
0/1	By the time I'll be getting my corona vaccine y'all be moved onto other things thinking the pandemic is over everywhere. "I'm vaccinated" will be met with "against what?" I'm sure of it.
0/-1	By your own explanation, since I've already had the virus the mRNA has already done it's thing, therefore the vaccination will do nothing for me that my body hasn't already done. Yes?
1/1	Byeeeeee COVID
0/0	C'mon man! Now...here's the deal... The doc died from the vaccine. CASE CLOSED!

1/-1	COVID-19 HAS BEEN ERADICATED
0/0	COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE: The experimental mRNA vaccine is NOT a vaccine as it does not give any immunity or prevent anyone from spreading the virus but does cause unknown adverse effects including death. The vast majority of people are now immune and we already have very effective treatments and preventatives for COVID-19*.There is absolutely no need for any experimental vaccine for COVID-19. *https://c19ivermectin.com/
1/1	COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications, and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. Inject the vaccine to protect you.
1/1	COVID-19 disproportionately impacts the health of people from marginalized groups. Members of these groups are. Not curbing the spread of COVID-19 entails added suffering for members of these groups who are already victims of historic and current injustices
0/0	COVID-19 has a 99.97% survival rate. These are great chances. Vaccines introduce unknowns. Without long-term evidence, there are no promises there won‚Äôt be yet unknown side effects which will be devastating. It can‚Äôt possibly be known until they‚Äôve been applied for a long time.I will not get a COVID vaccine.
1/1	COVID-19 is not a hoax. Wear a mask. Social distance. Don't go to an in-person Super Bowl Party. Get the vaccine when you can. The Lord bless you and keep you.
1/1	COVID-19 lessons from Israel after 4 lockdowns (depending how you count) and ~30% of people vaccinated: Lockdowns work only if you actually lock things down, vaccines are safe and work well if you actually get vaccinated, transparency is key, fake news & lying = bad
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccine drive may prove to be the biggest health movement in the history of mankind. To help the Government roll it out smoothly, organizations of all industries, sectors, and sizes have stepped up.

1/1	COVID-19 vaccines are developed following the same legal requirements for pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy as other medicines.
1/-1	COVID-19 vaccines are medicines that prevent disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by triggering an immune response
1/1	COVID-19 vaccines are precisely what we need ASAP to safely get our lives back.

1/1	COVID-19 vaccines do not contain egg protein, so there is no concern
1/1	COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness
1/1	COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in clinical trials and have been approved because those studies show that the vaccine significantly reduces the probability of contracting the virus.
1/1	COVID-19 wasn‚Äôt our fault. But taking risk with COVID-19 is our fault. Playing the blamegame like passing the parcel btwn political parties is our fault.Counting scores between Tablighi Jamaat in 2020 vs Kumbh Mela in 2021 is our fault.Debating on Vaccines is our fault.

0/0	Can we just let this go? The pharmaceutical companies already got our money... Just LEAVE US ALONE!
1/1	Can we just take a moment and think about how truly amazing it is that we seem to have 2+ effective vaccines in less than a year from initiation of development? It is absolutely the greatest showing of our collective, global scientific output and such a rare opportunity in history for us to actually measure it. The common enemy that unites us, and allows us a small window in history in which the whole science community, across disciplines focus on one objective.

1/1	Covid is a relatively low risk for death. But there is more and more evidence that, for a not insignificant portion of those infected, there are long term negative effects. I felt comfortable enough with the mRNA vaccine to get it, but I understand why some would be skeptical.

1/-1	Covid-19 vaccine candidate is 90% effective, says manufacturer. 90% is incredible. It means that we only need like 60-70% of people to take it to get to herd immunity levels, theoretically (EDIT: there's some debate on what this percentage should be. The closer to 100% the better, but you start to see the effects much earlier than that. 70-80% might be enough for this virus). I know we want everyone to take it, but there's a significant number of people that won't because reasons. If this vaccine were only 60% effective, it would still be good news, but it would mean we'd need almost every person to get vaccinated. Now we have a little wiggle room.

I‚Äôm not going to claim any expertise, other than to say that in the UK Covid has claimed more than 125000 lives (this a likely underestimate, given all these deaths were within 28 days of infection), while a handful of deaths have been associated with vaccination (at most, as causation is difficult to prove). This despite over 30 million jabs having been given in the UK. Deaths from Covid are now into single figures per day (from 1800 per day in January) - not all of this reduction is associated with vaccination, but a lot probably is.

0/0	DON'T GET THE VACCINE My friend got covid and recovered in just a few days. Nothing super significant about that right? Wrong! He has CF (cystic fibrosis) which is a major issue with the lungs. Research says that people with pre-existing diseases WILL die if they get covid. Like I said, he was fine. He told me it was nothing more than an intense flu. In just a few days, he got over it. One last thing, HE DID NOT HAVE THE VACCINE. Besides, do people really know what is actually in this Vaccine? This could be the easiest way ever that whoever made these "vaccines" take over the world. All they would need to have done is put some sort of devise in with the vaccine that enables them to access the brain, and ta da, they take over. (Just sayin.)

I do my own logical thinking like any other normal person. I'm not sure which organization it was. CDC or WHO. one of the two claimed that masks weren't necessary. which had my bullshit alarm going DING DING DING DING. because like I said earlier. I actually use my brain. I've been wearing 2 masks since the start of the pandemic plus a face-shield. it's only logical to think two layers are better than one. that a layer is better than no layer. You have a brain. for the love of whatever god you worship. USE YOUR BRAIN.

0/0	Dear patients, after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine, you will no longer be able to treat the symptoms of the vaccine in a complementary way. You will have to live with the consequences because you will no longer be able to be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body, just like a person with a genetic defect like Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, stopping genetic heart disease, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, etc.), because the genetic defect is eternal! This clearly means: if a vaccination symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination, neither I nor any other therapist will be able to help you, as the damage caused by this vaccination will be genetically irreversible. In my opinion, these new vaccines represent a crime against humanity that has never been committed in such a significant way in history." - Robert F. Kennedy 4/9/21 Covid vaccine injuries. Telegram

0/-1/0	Definitely a very good, clear and compelling presentation. The only question that remains for me, and which some immunologists have posed, is whether the spike proteins produced, which induce the immune system response, can lead to autoimmune disease, particularly in some susceptible individuals; and, that such reactions may not manifest until several months or years (3-4) later.
1/1	Definitely getting the vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
1/1	Definitely going to get vaccinated.
0/0	Definitely going to wait and see if there any long term side effects. Astra Zeneca's are already causing some blood clots. People are desperate and they'll let someone inject them with grape juice if they thought it would help at this point. Good luck to everyone.
1/1/1/1	Definitely not going to be in the priority group, but if I ever get a chance at it, I'll take my chances. Partially because I'm keen for travel to resume, and partially because we can't be having everyone take a wait-and-see approach. Someone's got to go first.

But J&J providing 72% protection and 100% protection from death in ONE shot that doesn‚Äôt require ultra-cold storage, is also a miracle

0/0	Dr. Katherine can you please explain how the covid19 is deactivating our dna receptors for skin? The release of covid19 is obviously a military bio attack. The dna recptors for the skin were removed so that covid19 could be manipulated to attack certain skin tones. How do the current vaccines interact with covid19 infection? And what are the possibility our descendants will have major skin issues like Stephens Johnson syndrome? Please correct my post with your facts. Thanks.

1/1	EW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE: Pfizer vaccine efficacy: Pfizer and BioNTech on Wednesday said that their experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is 95% effective 7 days after the second dose. The companies released the final efficacy analysis from their phase 3 trial, which has enrolled over 43,000 people. The placebo group has had 162 COVID-19 cases, compared with the vaccine group's 8. Among adults over age 65 in particular, efficacy was maintained at 94%. Of the 10 cases of severe COVID-19 diagnosed, 9 occurred in the placebo group. The data monitoring group has not noted any serious safety effects. The companies intend to submit a request for an emergency use authorization "within days." I got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine 12/23/2020. NO PROBLEMS.

0/0	Ebola vaccine was developed after 10 years...most of the viral vaccines are developed after a time frame how come they are already ready with vaccine in less ten a year and why China is not talking anything on vaccine. We cannot let people die like that
1/1	Educate yourself and take the bloody vaccine!
1/1	Education is key, looking back at history there is no reason not to take the vaccine.
1/1	Eh I wouldn't take it as fear mongering and more of a "if you have severe allergic reactions you might want to consult your GP"
0/0	Eh I‚Äôll just wait a while until non of those people get sick
1/1	Eh.. I‚Äôll take 91% effective overall and 100% effective against severe COVID after 6 months. Hell, I‚Äôd take 60% effective with a higher efficacy of preventing severe infection/death.
0/0	Either way i don't want it
1/1	Either way, I trust vaccines seeing as they have saved millions of lives.
1/0	Either way:- No vaccine - potentially poorly Vaccine - probably not poorly (or reduced likelihood of poorliness, anyway)
1/1	Eligible for a vaccine? Have it, then.
0/0/0	Emergency use authorization, no liability for pfizer/moderna, rushed trials, you can still transmit the virus once vaccinated, rushed trials. Need more reasons?
0/0	Employers who force employees to take it should be sued since u can't sue the companies who make it!!!
1/1	Employment should be denied if workers deny the vaccine. How else will we ever get ahead of this?

1/1	Enough people have died already, we need to save ourselfs. Its time to heal with the vaccines
1/1	Entirely agree. Make it compulsory or they loose their jobs. How did we eradicate polio, and other diseases. People are so selfish and idiots. Getting it might change their minds
1/-1	Erin O'toole's outrage over vaccines is completely ridiculous especially when he apparently has no issues with his biggest endorser Jason Kenney making cuts to healthcare during the pandemic.
1/-1	Estimates say it'll cost between $3 to $30 per dose. Lets say its $30 that's 9.81 billion dollars to ensure everything American has the vaccine...not even 10 billion. Makes sense, and that's assume the dosage is $30 per vaccine.
1/1	Even IF the vaccine did cause blood clots, it's still lower than a population average‚Ä¶
1/1	Even from a purely capitalist perspective, vaccines makes total sense. It's why pretty much every for-profit health plan gets behind free yearly flu vaccines, because sick people cost more, both to the health plan and to the employer. Not to mention sick people aren't out spending money.
0/0	Even health officials are calling this political bullshit. The firefighters and medical professionals don't even wanna take this greedy death curse.
0/0	Even health workers don‚Äôt want it.
0/-1	Even if I get an infection, I could still spread it. It does not work.
0/0/0/0/0	Even if I have to loose my job and become homeless I will not take it.
1/1	Even if it was in the vaccine it would be a version of the virus that wouldn‚Äôt be able to actually infect us. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing for years. And that fever you get from a vaccine sometimes isn‚Äôt because you‚Äôve been infected by the virus in the vaccine. It‚Äôs because your immune system is functioning normally! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs supposed to happen. Fevers aren‚Äôt caused by infections; they‚Äôre part of your body‚Äôs response to what‚Äôs infected it (or what it thinks it‚Äôs infected by, in the case of certain vaccines). It‚Äôs trying to kill the pathogen!
0/0	Even if it was mandatory, I'm not taking it!
0/0	Even if it's safe and works, its still my choice not to have it. I've never had flu jab and never had the flu
0/0	Even if it‚Äôs not rushed I still won‚Äôt take it. It‚Äôs not liable
1/1	Even if people that are vaccinated can still transmit. Every person vaccinated is one less person that will not need to be hospitalized if they do happen to get it. (unless they are the exception). The major issue with this virus is the hospitalizations.
1/1	Even if the COVID vaccine isn‚Äôt perfect, yes it may have side effects but I‚Äôm willing to take a bullet for others.
0/0	Even if the answer is yes my answer is NO.
1/-1	Even if the found it I‚Äôm still going to wear a mask just in case
1/1	Even if the six deaths were definitively and directly tied to the vaccine, that's literally one in a million chance of dying: your current chances of dying after contracting Covid are between 1 and 3 in 100. That's a factor of 10,000.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Even if u have the vaccine u dont get to go back to normal and u might die or be left with a disabily or bizarre illness so why would u have it?
1/1/1	Even if vaccines can cause autism and it's a big if. It's still better than everyone dying of influenza or other preventable diseases. Polio is much worse than autism
1/-1	Even if vaccines caused autism (which they don't), then wouldn't she still rather have a living autistic child then a child dead from German measles?
1/1/1/1	Even if vaccines did cause autism, weird how some parents would rather have their kid dead than disabled
1/1	Even if you ignore mortality, there are plenty of people with Covid who have symtpoms that last for ages ‚Äòlong covid‚Äô and theres no certainty when. these will end. A vaccine greatly reduces the chances of this happening to you
0	Even if you will take all the necessary precautions to stay safe, if it's time to go you can't do anything to prevent it. Just go with the natural flow of life.
1/-1	Even in India, my third world country vaccines are highly subsidised (like the vaccine for Swine Flu in a private hospital costs less than 2$). All essential vaccines are free in govt. hospitals.
0/0	Even my leftie mum refuses to get the vaccine. Mum always knows best!
1/1	Even of the threat eventually faded because of vaccines and Covid becomes yet another common circulating virus, I believe we should seek the total eradication of Sars Covid-19. The forced extinction of a virus purely out of spite
1/1	Even people under 30 are better off taking the vaccine vs the chance of Covid.
0/0	Even so, why all of this vaccines goes to your DNA? Why are they playing with the entire human population like lab rabbits?
0/0	Even taking the vaccine doesn't make the corona go away!
0/0	Even the most coreupt bureaucratic organizations admit MRNA is not a vaccine, but an experimental biological agent.
1/0	Even the your vaccinated you can still spread it
1/1	Even though my entire household has COVID, I am so fucking happy that people will get this vaccine and not have to go through this. Its a good day.
1/-1	Even when the gameboard gets into this seemingly lost state, there will exist a winning move not taken - to vastly scale up mRNA vaccine manufacture capabilities, and respond to new immune-bypassing viral strains within weeks. Maybe China or Israel will do that; the USA can't.
0/0	Even when viewing the science that's being presented as objectively as I can I'm still not willing to get a vaccine based on the info(or lack there of) I'm recieving.
1/1	Even with perfect employment of social distancing measures, mask wearing, and personal hygiene, there is still a risk of infection without a vaccine.

0/0	Every day I hear about how scientists still don‚Äôt understand how this virus works. That they don‚Äôt have a single clue why/how/if/when...yet, somehow they‚Äôre able to make a vaccine that protects against this virus? The virus they don‚Äôt understand? Yes, makes sense
0/0	Every doctor will back the COVID vaccine. I will not be getting it and will never trust anything that Bill Gates is involved with.
1/1/1/1	Every drug has side effects, you should read viagra warnings.

1/1	Every one of us has been getting vaccinated since we were infants and that you are still alive so you can be paranoid is pretty solid proof your fear of this one is as dumb as it gets.
0/0	Every person at my place of work who has had the vaccine say they felt ill after. I would not have it if they paid me.
1/1	Every person deserves vaccine
1	Every person should be injected in order to achieve herd protection.
1/1	Every person should have the opportunity to get it
1/0	Every person who gets two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine decreases her own probability of dying if COVID-19 by over 95%. Additionally, as part of the pool of humanity, she decreases the probability COVID-19 death of each individual in her extended circle by a small amount.
1/1	Every person who was born in this earth get vaccinated SINCE birth. And kids till getting elder (seasons flu shot) and yes you get tired AND ITS NORMAL
1/1	Every pill you ever took had a long list of potential side effects, have the vaccine
1/1/1	Every shot in the arm is another step toward stopping #COVID and ending this pandemic.
1/1	Every single Covid vaccine is more effective than the annual ‚Äòflu vaccines. Media outlets need to stop irresponsible reporting merely to generate headlines
1/-1	Every single country had the ability to purchase vaccines
1/1	Every single thing we do day and night has a risk . Our whole life is about taking risk . Covid jab is no different . eg- Drive to the supermarket is more riskier travel experience than taking a covid jab
1/1/1	Every single vaccination is one step closer to returning to normal.
1/1	Every vaccine has a side effect, it's nothing new. With the vaccines, all you'll get is a sore arm and nothing more. It's better than having covid.
1/1	Every vaccine has side effects. Prescription meds have more and far worse side effects. The vaccine side effects are called your immune systems learning the virus and creating antibodies. Serious vaccine injuries are very rare.
1/1	Every vaccine protects virtually 100% against serious illness, hospitalization and death!
1/1	Every vaccine/drug have side effects. Its not a rocket science.
1/1	Every week you talk we have vaccine but in the reality ground we found slow process no action you just close the province and make lockdown that easiest thing you can do it we lost our jobs and business I hope government take reaction to get people vaccinate
0/0	Every year hospitals are full, senior care and lodging, schools, workplaces are ravaged with influenza and many die. No secret, no hype, no fear and quite honestly no one bats an eye. Its influenza, its accepted, it happens every year....right. So where is it this year. It failed to make an appearance üò≤ Instead we have a virus that now has several strains. Yup that's right. Viruses doing what they do even with our annual flu season. We have a new vaccine now to fight it. Praise the miracle! This vaccine has a 95% success rate...yup 95% in insuring you still wear the mask, won't be protected, can still pass it on and
1/1	Every year we have to rollout a new flu vaccine because the virus mutates, but we get on with life because the vaccines are there for it. New we have the same for Covid-19 the same can be applied, we can‚Äôt live like the last year forever.
0/0	Everybody ain‚Äôt getting the same shot! They ant fooling nobody!
1/-1	Everybody gangsta until Corona vaccine turns everyone into Titans
1/0	Everybody is sitting here downgrading the vaccine because they're afraid to take it or just plain idiots would you rather deal with the covid-19 and be put into an induced coma in the hospital and your family not knowing if you'll make it boy can't we be smarter
1/1	Everybody should take the vaccine
1/1	Everybody that does not take the vaccine will die
1/1	Everybody's different ..but I had both shots already, you don't even feel it ..and I didn't have any side effects.. best shot i ever got!
0/0	Everybody's rushing to get a vaccine to market, and cutting corners. Does anyone remember thalidomide, a 60-year old sedative? For some reason, probably corner-cutting again, it didn't get properly tested on pregnant women. The result was that thousands of babies were born with major deformities. So, even though I'm in a high-COVID-risk group, I'm not going to be one of the first lining up for a shot of one of these half-tested vaccines.
0/0/0/0/0	Everyone Concerned about COVID deaths but when it‚Äôs vaccine related death it‚Äôs not a concern ???....
1/1	Everyone I know who have had the vaccine had no side effects at all. Can‚Äôt wait to have mine. I want to see my family soon.
1/1	Everyone I know who‚Äôs gotten covid has had it pretty bad and everyone who‚Äôs had the vaccine has done fine with it!
1/1	Everyone I work with is ready and willing to get the vaccine, and we're in biotech.
1/1	Everyone I work with is ready and willing to get the vaccine, but we're in biotech. So I'm not sure how helpful that is for you.
0/1	Everyone else is doing it. You should to. It is your moral duty to do it.
1/1	Everyone get your damn vaccine so I can be a part of the herd immunity since I'm "medically unable" to get it!!!
0/0	Everyone getting vaccinated is a little test subject , no different than a lab mouse.
1/1	Everyone have to be careful about this virus it‚Äôs real,have seen people who‚Äôs been affected by it. Hope the vaccine works as the say too
1/-1	Everyone is talking about how bad or mild this disease is when they get it, but they're not even discussing the lasting side effects from having covid. We see people with lasting cardiac and pulmonary issues after having covid. Too many people concerned with the possible long term effects of getting the vaccine but not concerned with what happens to your body after having covid.
1/1	Everyone knew the EU Commission would totally fail. Arguing 3 mths in price when AZ giving this vaccine away practically for Free! Only the Commission could screw this up.... love the German media reaction to VdL trying to blame others.. Uk vaccinate 10,000,000. With AZ Oxford now proven excellent for over 65s And prevents virus transmission
0/0	Everyone make sure they don‚Äôt take this vaccine. It is the Mark of The Beast.
0/0	Everyone must make the decision whether or not to receive the vaccine for themselves. I'm personally not interested in receiving it. Aside from that, Percy out here looking like a fine, Black Goku! :)
1/1	Everyone must take the vaccine. its very important. it should compulsory to the citizens...
1/1	Everyone needs a vaccine
1/1	Everyone needs the vaccine to eradicate CoVid-19
1/1/1	Everyone needs this vaccine, let's pray we get the shot on time.
1/1	Everyone should care for the ones who might get seriously ill by the virus and take the vaccine
1/1	Everyone should get the vaccine if you qualify
1/1/1	Everyone should get vaccinated, it's the healthy and safe thing you can do for you and your family and friends!
1/1	Everyone should get vaccined, then we exempt from lockdown restrictions
1/1	Everyone should have the vaccinated without cost. The vaccine should be made available to everyone free
0/0	Everyone should not take this devils brew.
1/1	Everyone should take the vaccine. Even the anti-vaccine people
1/1	Everyone take the damn shot!
1/1	Everyone thats looking forvard to live our life as it was before covid should take the vaccine ASAP
1/1	Everyone wants to go back to normal! Vaccination is the solution.
0/0	Everyone who has not already taken any of the vaccines needs to back away. There are many doctors who say it is ineffective and potentially dangerous.
1/1	Everyone who take the vaccine trails are HERO. Stay strong!
1/1	Everyone who went to school should know that take the vaccine is the only opption...
1/1	Everyone with any brain power will take it
0/0	Everyone's infected except you and me and everyone we know...............
1/1	Everyone's so hostile to each other in here. Guys, we're all people . You have the right not to take the vaccine just as much as you have the right to take it when it comes out, calm the hell down. The reality is people are dying and could greatly benefit from a vaccine. The reality is some people also are not affected by COVID-19 whatsoever. But please take a moment to consider each other. We all just want to be healthy safe and happy, right? We all live in the same world, we gotta stop acting like everyone's an enemy.
0/-1	Everyone: I hope they make something soon to end the spread When the vaccine is announced: I‚Äôm not taking it until everyone else does
1/1	Everyone‚Äôs body is going to react differently to the Covid-19 vaccine...yes there have been a few bad or really bad things happen but it is mostly positive
1/1	Everything has risk!!! You know what else causes cancer? breathing. Stop doing that if you don't want to get cancer.
0/0	Everything is AMAZING isn't it. Keep your nasty vaccine I do not need it. I have a very strong immune system my God in heaven gave me. You are misled or you are liars along with the government .
0/-1	Everything is a conspiracy theory until happens.
1/1	Everything seems good from the scientific side with the vaccine
0/0	Everything that has to do with so-called covid is a scam! You should not be vaccinated and of course do not wear a mask. it turned out that there are small worms in masks that look like black sewing threads and those who have been vaccinated will become seriously ill and that some of them have already died
0/0	Everything they do is just simply EVIL .
0/0	Everything they said and never once asked who "Wants" this vaccine. I know no one who wants it including myself. Anyone who tested positive for the virus does not need one.
0/0	Everything you put in your body from pharmakeia is harmful. Side effects just differ from person to person. I will never take any vaccine but for those that do No reason to get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.97% recovery rate.
1	Evidence of vaccination by Covid is also dying. I think it is good that there are still critical voices, who have not allowed themselves to be silenced. It shows that there is still hope. Should be vaccinated yourself when time is given, but not with AZ
0/0	Evidence that the Co-vid 19 vaccines are not safe is mounting. I have often thought that the Wuhan Virus is-- or is related to-- a biological weapon. I'm not letting it into my body via a shot.
0/0	Evil thing. I refuse any vaccines
0	Evil vaccine
0/0	Ew. Never
0/0	Exactly if the makers don't believe in their product enough to take responsibility for damage from their product no thank. Don't try to shame me for not taking it you deal with it if you get damaged from taking it.
1/-1	Exactly this. People are saying oh it‚Äôs only 6 months, but like it‚Äôs only been six months since the trial! It could be years for all we know (hopefully).
0/0	Exactly why I‚Äôm holding off on all the vaccines for now. I‚Äôm already at risk for blood clots and stroke.
1/1	Exactly why schools can wait to open. Vaccines first.
0/0	Exactly! And they want us to take a vaccine that alters your dna. A vaccine that they aren‚Äôt even sure prevents transmission etc. they don‚Äôt even know I. Which ways it is effective fully so who knows what crazy side effects it has? With a survival rate so high, the risk is ok with me.
0/0	Exactly! It's fucken suspicious. It's not even a 'vaccine' they can't guarantee it will prevent covid. What is the real agenda here? Population sterilisation?!
1/1	Exactly. I believe in vaccines but I don't want to be the first in line for the COVID vaccine(s). Why? Because all of these vaccines currently undergoing trials were developed exceptionally fast using new techniques. But yes, I most certainly will get vaccinated.
0/0	Exactly. Never taking any vaccine. They put yourself and others at risk and I feel like a Guinea pig by taking it, because they only want people to take it to help the economy.
0/0	Exactly. how can we trust the medical industry when it's main motive is money. all they want is money.
1/1	Excellent , we need that vaccine in Europe now
0/0/0	Excellent and thank you. People need to wake up to the horrors these jabs are causing and the whole control agenda. It may as well be an alien invasion as the goals are the same. VAXXTERMINATION & GLOBAL ENSLAVEMENT of the few survivors required, now that automation and A.I can handle all the psychopathic megalomaniac parasitic needs. We are superfluous and merely a drain of resources. It's cull time. They have declared war on humanity. So be prepped and ready to bring it to them and have them run to their bunkers until we dig them out and lawfully arrest, investigate, trial and exile to life imprisonment, Darpa bio-sensor chipped (so we can tell when they are nearly dead) and then lawful public execution of the worst insider trading, war profiteering, nuremburg war criminal eugenicist sociopathic parasites, the world has ever known. Peace to you Christian :) Natural immunity and Vitamin D all sunny day long. BAN THE JABS.ARREST THE PREDATOR PLOTTERS. EVOLVE AS ONE UNITED HUMANITY PURGED OF SCUM.
1/1	Excellent description of how the mRNA Covid vaccine works and how it was designed to maximize the efficiency of the translation into spike proteins and to evade destruction by the immune system at the time of injection.
1/1	Excellent news! I'm hoping i can be one of the people who gets this early. My wife is pregnant and my biggest fear in life is having her catch it from me and potentially losing her and our child!
1/1	Excellent news, hopefully this gets approved within the next two-two and a half weeks and we can start getting these into arms by late February!
1/1	Excellent news. I can't wait for my family and friends and myself to get this treatment.... Everyone stay safe and take care until then.

1/1	Experts continue to conduct more studies about the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on severity of illness from COVID-19, as well as its ability to keep people from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
0/0	Explain how a protein strand found in Ebola, another sequence found in SARS-2 and finally the use of a Corrona virus as a delivery mechanism is called COVID-19??? Naturally occuring? Not in a million years...the fact it is only RNA single stranded protein tells you this was assembled. This is a man made virus, released by accident or malicuous intent is all we need know now.
0/0	Explain why Pfizer have been given ‚Äòexemption from liability.‚Äô
0/0	Explain why you get a sore throat from the vaccine and all the symptoms of having the virus. That can only happen if it is invading cells

0/1	Extremely effective at what? Shortening your life span? Yeah that's true. There good for fuck all else.

1/1	FIRE them for being stupid. Unless you have a history of severe allergies and anaphylaxis you should be getting the vaccine. These people will go straight to hell for their selfishness and putting other at risk.
0/0	FREE:: my Coronavirus shot, Up for grabs!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	FRUIT, VEG, WATER, and lots of VITAMINS should be the daily headlines pumped and pumped into the public eye by all media. Never ever under any circumstances do you pump a virus with metals and all unsavory ingredients in any person who is weak elderly or disabled that has a low weak immune system, NEVER. FRUIT, VEG, WATER, NOT TAP WATER BUT CLEAN WATER. The whole world should be supporting all farmers to grow grow grow fruit and vegetables on a huge scale, the price should be minimum. Strange how the disabled and elderly are those who are dying mostly!!! and they are such important people for all societies, they are full of wisdom mind strength, and positivity, they are special, they are priceless.
0/0	FT - Israel has more than 50% vaccination but their new Covid cases are not diminishing. Any analysis you can provide? Thanks.

0/0	Fabiafidus - minuscule??? so you‚Äôd be fine if that 1 death in 25000 is your child, partner, parent or sibling? Bet you couldn‚Äôt say yes. Just one life taken from a vaccine is unacceptable!!
1/1	Fabulous news! Another vaccination option to help us move forward and get back to something nearer normality
1/1	Facebook are still refusing to take down anti vaccine profiles.
0/0	Fact check- these are experimental for emergency use only... no thanks Bill Gates and crew
0/0	Fact check: vaccines are not the only way to boost your immune system against Covid, Vitamin D, Selenium, Zinc, Vitamin C, are actually not only good enough, but to fight Covid faster than the vaccine. Many I personally know between 70 and 80 have used it with covid and got healed within a matter of days( 85% of deaths have been within this group and older, yet they lived to see another day).
0/0	Fact: all the people I know that have gotten it have had body aches and fevers and sickness. Sooooooo..... Have fun y'all.
1/1	Facts. The people who still say the vaccine is "poison" f**king annihilate my hope in an instant though. Same with those who don't think the virus is real and that 3million people just died randomly lmao.

1/1	Fantastic explanation. The vaccines for covid are amazing. I've had both doses of pfizer, nearly all of my family have had their first dose or are scheduled for it (which is a huge relief!), and every time someone posts a happy selfie with their vaccine card I think: we are this much closer to beating this. We are this much closer to going back to hugs and eating together and singing together.
1/1	Fantastic information. I took Pfizer first dose and going for second in 11 days but this is great to pass on to anyone I may know that may be considering this one.
1/1	Fantastic news very happy to hear this and a massive well done to all involved in the rollout so far . Feel happy to be part of that 32 million . This vaccine programme so far has been absolutely remarkable
1/-1	Fantastic news!

1/1	Fantastic news.
0/1/-1	Fantastic, Its a bloody shame a lot of people will only read the headline and assume the worst...
1/1	Fantastic. Can‚Äôt wait to get mine so I can have my life back. I‚Äôve been mostly sheilding since March.
1/1	Fantastic. The sooner the FDA Grants Johnson&Johnson emergency use authorization the sooner we can start to alleviate critical Supply Shortages.
0/-1	Fast food place is required to be inspected at the very least every year. Pharma facilities are inspected one time in 9 years... you can often visually inspect food to see if it is okay. Producing 14M doses of vaccine with ‚Äúthe wrong ingredient‚Äù like J&J did is not possible unless it involves fraud. Finally, the only reason they stopped is because they got caught. Furthermore, the only way they get caught is when the FDA catches a statistically significant group of people dying from consuming the same product from the same facility...
0/0	Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination.
0/0	Fauci can have my share of the shots. He needs another double dose‚Ä¶
0/0	Fauci doesn‚Äôt make any money from the Johnson and Johnson vaccine does he?
1/1	Fauci isn't always a reliable source of information, but he is completely correct on this point. The J&J vaccine provides a high degree of protection against moderate to severe cases and is 100% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. It is also a lot easier to distribute than Pfizer / Moderna since it doesn't need to be kept as cold and it is only a single dose. The J&J vaccine needs to be approved and distributed ASAP.
0/0	Fauci literally said with a straight face, the ‚Äòvaccine‚Äôis 90% effective but if you don‚Äôt continue to wear a mask you‚Äôll give it to others. Seriously, is it me?
0/0/0	Fauci needs to be fired now. Fauci knew about the positive effects of Hydroxychloroquine on SARS-Covid & Corona virus. Fauci has covered this up in order to push the forced vaccination agenda.

1/1	Feeling very grateful to have been vaccinated today
1/1	Feeling very grateful.
1/1	Feels good. I‚Äôm on immune suppressing drugs, so I was afraid my shots (Moderna) might not work as intended, and people with autoimmune diseases were excluded from the studies. I felt like shit from the 2nd shot, which I took to be a good sign. Doctor ordered antibody test anyway, and I made antibodies. It‚Äôs such a relief to feel protected.

0/1	Finally a doctor that has some sense. I'm not subjecting myself to the covid vaccine
1/1	Finally a video where the information is presented clearly and concisely, with no overt agenda. This makes me feel significantly better about the vaccine. Still interested in any longer term effects, but seeing how it works coupled with a rudimentary understanding of cell biology, I feel more confident in the notion that there will be limited long term effects.
1/1	Finally got my appointment! Wednesday here I come!,

1/1	Finally, watched. Very interesting! Thank you again for bringing us clear and well explained information without the biased politics! And Thanks Dr Kim for your continuous efforts to develop a vaccine.
1/1	Finally. Can't wait to get this to the masses. Give the mRNA to the older generation and this to the youngans since it protects them better.
1	Finally. Hope to get mine in a couple of months. Totally ready to go to a crowded restaurant and back to the movies!!!
1/1	Finaly things can go back to normal
1/-1	Find a dr who says donot get this vaccine..l
0/0	Find it hard to believe they just whipped up this vaccine really quick. Baa Baa Baaaaaaa haha
1/1	Find it weird that the fervent supporters of herd immunity don‚Äôt actually want herd immunity now that‚Äôs it can be achieved with a vaccine.
1/1	Find your place in the vaccine line! Hope see you in the vaccine line soon!
1/1	Fine anti-vaxxers, we won‚Äôt blame the virus if it kills you guys; well just blame your poor choice.
1/1	Fine message. I have completed the two doses. Except body pain no other side-effects are noticeable.
1/1	Fine message. I have completed the two doses. Except body pain no other side-effects are noticeable.üôè
1/1	Fine with me. I‚Äôm very happy to do my part and not get Covid and die. Or pass it one to someone else who would die. It‚Äôs called civilization bubbas
1/0	Fine. Don‚Äôt take the vaccine. Enough people will take it to counter your ignorance. Just don‚Äôt expect to be allowed to travel across any international borders.
1/-1/1	Fingers crossed every single private institution requires proof of vaccine for people to enter once it has been widely available.
1/1	Finished my second round of phyzer (spl?) over a week ago. First round, a little soreness, second round a little more soreness and a day of feeling a bit tired. Very happy I was eligible and willing.
1/-1	First
1/1	First Pfizer's is 90% effective, and now Moderna's is 95%? This is fantastic, especially with so many people wary of the vaccine. We're almost there, everyone!
1/1	First covid #vaccination this morning, can‚Äôt describe the relief that will be a bit safer soon
1/1	First dose done! (I‚Äôm smiling under this mask.)
1/1	First dose down! Feeling great. Please, get your vaccine when you qualify. Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect yourself and others from COVID
1/1	First dose had at London Bridge centre, very happy to have had it, when you get offered it to have it
1/1	First dose of moderna today (30F) feeling good besides a sore arm
1/1	First dose of shot, taken. Covid vaccine for baby, done. Still need tdap.
1/1	First dose on board March 24th. #2 coming up. Science is freaking amazing!
1/1	First dose taken. Never felt better <3
1/1	First dose today! I got my first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine today and I'm feeling more than better.
1/1	First in line! I will take my chances. I am a Chauffeur. In cars with people I don't know. I promise you this. No one get in the vehicle without as mask! Or they are walking!
0/0	First it was 2 weeks to flatten the curve, then wear a mask to save Grandpa, then wait till the vaccine, well now all of a sudden Grandpa is Vaccinated and getting arrested for not wearing a mask. This was never about a virus, time to RISE
0/0	First mRna vaccine in history, with side effects monitored for less than 365 days. No thanks, I won't be a guinea pig for this mass gene therapy.
0/0	First make sure the vaccines are fully tested and proven safe before pushing the world to take them. We are not your test animals.
0/0	First of all, It is not "safe"..people have actually died from it....GLHF Dont trust the robots
0/-1	First off by "coronavirus vaccines" you mean sars virus vaccine, and they been studying that for more like a decade and a half. Secondly they might be if the same family of viruses, but they have not been studying a new virus that appeared 3 years ago 10 years ago. They may be similar but they are not the same virus. Have fun with blood clots lab rat.
1/1	First read this prediction and thought, Well in New York seems I'm falling in that 10%. Then I read that Cuomo was opening vaccines to 30+ tomorrow! So if you're 30+ in NY, get in line and get your vaccine. Let's beat this.
1/1	First shot down... I‚Äôve had a recent history with some bad lungs issues so I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve finally started this process. GET VACCINATED, FRIENDS! SAVE LIVES.
1/1	First shot of Pfizer. Sore arm for a few hours. That's it.
1/0/1/1/0/1/0/1/1/1/1/0/1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1/1	First time at my favorite restaurant in more than a year. Kind of emotional. Cheers to science! Yay Manhattan!!!!!
0/0	First use the corrupt politicians as guinea pigs!!
1/1	First vaccination tomorrow, which is great. Only 1/5 of my elderly vulnerable family vaccinated, which isn't great. Hearing so many stories of failure to provide the infrastructure for mass vaccinations.
1/1	First vaccine done!
1/1/1	First vaccine today! Got the Moderna. Everything was extremely well organized. This is a good day!
0/0	First volunteer for COVID-19 Vaccine is dead. She died 2days after availing herself for the vaccination.
0/0	First you both inject this tasty mRNA vaccine, upload your video of both doses.
0/0	First, don‚Äôt talk to us as we are clueless kids. Second, I watched this video till the end just to hear your main argument for safety is ‚Äú science is awesome?‚Äù Common. For the first time in history you tell the human cell to produce a foreign particle that the immune system detects as threat, and all you have to say is ‚Äúawesome‚Äù ? This is the main reason why folks are concerned and there is absolutely no credible explanation offered as to how this mechanism of artificial manipulation of human cell to manufacture a part of the virus is safe, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and harmless.
0/0	Flu is down 98% this season with it being relabeled covid19
1/0	Flu shots are free. Why wouldn't Covid shots be?
1/1	Flu vaccines have been around for years. Most of these vaccines are just alterations of already existing vaccines. It's not like they had to design an Ebola vaccine from scratch..
0/0	Flu yes covid no. I will not get that for my children. That vaccine could have dangerous long term effects. I for one don't want to make that decision for my children.
1/1	Folks need to realize the power of science, when they made these vaccinations they were only working on this particular one, so all the time and effort was focused on one viruses! It was not made over night! Think about the flu vaccination, it? a guess each year as to which one will hit! MANY MANY HOURS went into this shot. That could save many lives!

1/1/1/1	Folks please get vaccinated... if not for you then do it for all those you love and care about! #Vaccinate #VaccinesSaveLives
1/-1	Followed this account ages ago with my mates as a joke but this isn't funny. This virus has killed over 100,000 people. Stay safe and stop spreading bullshit
1/1	For a vaccine we're looking at 12-18 months üòû
0/0	For all of you that don't know getting that shot nullifies health and life insurance policies
1/1	For all the anti-vaccine kids reading the comments , don't be scared the rest us who're all vaccinated we'll keep you safe :)
1/1	For all the crazy psychopaths in this comment section complaining over the vaccine being administered on live TV, I got both my doses already and have had absolutely no reactions.
1/1	For all the nay sayers trying to turn this into an opportunity to bash the Welsh Government - who cares? The sooner we have a majority vaccinated, the sooner we have a chance of rates dropping, and the sooner we have a chance of some (some, not total) return to normality and people having a living and a life. Probable most importantly, the sooner you can stop your whinging, about this anyway.
1/1	For all the negative people on here. Shut up . Be well happy there is a vaccine !
1/1	For anyone who wants their lives back, take the vaccine.
1/1	For better or worse, the recent news about the extremely rare blood clots for both J&J and AZ puts into perspective how impressive the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are. Even more good news for Moderna here. (Of course, I‚Äôm not suggesting that one should not accept J&J/AZ... I‚Äôm just impressed that Moderna/Pfizer are doing so well given their huge rollout)
1/1	For every kid who died because of vaccines 1000 died because the lack of it
1/1	For everyone saying they ‚Äúwon‚Äôt take a rushed vaccine‚Äù, none of this was rushed. They just accelerated the process with the use of newer technology. They still had many trials and errors, many different vaccines that made it through and many that did not. Stop trying to ‚Äúspread awareness‚Äù of a fact that isn‚Äôt even true.
1/0	For everyone talking about their symptoms from getting their shot, I‚Äôve heard the worse it is for you the worse COVID would‚Äôve been. Sorta why some people are experiencing nothing from the shot and some are tired for 3 days. If the shot does a number on you then you are definitely glad you got it!
1/1	For gods sake the scientists know their work, its been tested thoroughly!!
1/1	For goodness sake you people be thankful for all the work done to get us this vaccine, people a lot cleverer than you
1/1	For me, personally, I am more afraid of long-covid and shit like this than I am of the side effects of most of the vaccines.
0/0	For more than 15years the vaccine for HIV has not been found, how possible can it be for this corona lasting for a year and some good months to be found, let's take heart.
1/1	For now we don't have othewise other than taking the risk
1	For now, the reason I'm not taking it is because there are others who need it more than me; first responders, healthcare workers, and people at higher risk. But you better believe that the second it's available for us muggles, I'll be the first on line!
1/1	For once I'm actually glad to be in the U.S during covid. Our vaccine rollout has been crazy, I'm 25 with no existing conditions and got my second shot today. Anyone over 16 is eligible in many places here now, it's honestly impressive.
1/1	For once in my life I find myself agreeing with Boris Johnson. This won't become a habit. We all knew this virus would mutate over time and it will do so again. The important thing is to keep faith in the vaccine for otherwise we are defeated.
0/0	For once, I agree, that vaccine is doing a lot of damage‚Ä¶
1/1	For once, my state is at the top of the good lists, when we are mostly at the bottom. We have the third highest rate of vaccination rollouts of any other state so far. I personally have had both doses of the vaccine now and I'm not over 65 nor am I in a frontline position. I'm so hopeful now :)
1/1	For people who are anti vaccine, I feel sad for you. This is not a political issue and the fact people try to play that game are just sad. Think about your health and of others and not politics.
0/1/0	For people who don't want to get vaccinated, that is fine. The question is "What are they going to do in order to prevent or transmit infection to others?" Are they faithfully masking with N95 or higher with a properly fitting mask? Distancing on top of that? Are they scrupulously cleaning their hands, keys, phone, doorknobs, car controls, etc.? Are they avoiding bars, restaurants, or any other place where they would be removing their mask in public? Are they isolating at home? If yes, then THEY DON'T NEED THE VACCINE because they will not contract the virus. The problem is that people want to get "back to normal" and go to the beach, bars, restaurants, see relatives and friends, etc. You either have to live in a bubble, take your chances with the vaccine, or take your chances with COVID. I already had COVID in Feb of 2019 and it was BRUTAL. I choose the bubble. After adequate time, maybe I will choose the vaccine. But until then, it is my DUTY to other people not to get sick or pass it to others.
0/-1	For perspective, I've had clots during pregnancy and after. I also had a pulmonary embolism while 21/22 weeks pregnant. I'd specifically like to avoid being in the ICU on a vent again.
0/-1	For some health-care workers, experience in an industry that seems to put profits over patients and staff contributes to hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccines.
0/0	For something with a 99.97% survivability and hasn't been isolated.
1/1	For sure! But I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt nervous
1/1	For sure. I'm positive now and it freaking sucks. I couldn't eat without throwing up and just washing dishes feels like running a marathon.
1/1	For the anti Vaxxers, look at the comments from hpv vaccines. Look no one turned into no zombie
1/1	For the anti Vaxxers, look at the comments from hpv vaccines. Look no one turned into no zombie üßü‚ôÄÔ∏è they require up to three vaccines depending on the age.
0/0	For the love of God, stop pushing these vaccines!
1/1	For the record I am still patiently waiting for the Vaccine I got last week to turn me into a 5G Cell phone tower. All you people on the internet said it have computer chips in it and I am in serious need of better cell service at my house.. But zero damned change in signal, just some crappy immunity.
1/1	For the sake of humanity, take the vaccine!
1	For the sake of the people around me i will, but im not very inclined to...
0/0	For the time being, no. I am over 65, overweight and need knee replacement surgery (before you jump to conclusions, I had an injury 33 years ago BEFORE I became overweight and have had 4 surgeries on that knee. Over the years I have gained weight because I could no longer be as active as I had been).
1/1	For those anti vacciners because I know there are some here lurking. I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt side effects and such and such but would you rather die of covid?
1/1	For those in the back who weren't paying attention, Israel is essentially Covid free. Because of vaccines. Hopefully this will happen in many other countries in the coming months. #VaccinesWork
1/1	For those panicking about the 1 in several hundred thousand chance of blood clots from the Astrazenica vaccine, this is a list of possible side-effects of over-the counter painkillers affecting 1 in 1,000 people. No medicine is 100% risk-free!
1/0	For those scared of getting cancer, re-read some of the meds you take for diagnosed conditions like autoimmune ones. The drugs that they give you will have cancer and neurological side effects. Those who use recreational drugs or smoke, well if you can take that than what is a vaccine?
0/0	For those that died taking the placebo, I want to thank you and your family. Your sacrifice has been noted, honored and truly appreciated may you rest in peace o protector of the human species.
1/1	For those that still think it‚Äôs not real talk to a doctor or nurse. Listen to what they have to say. We usually listen to them and follow what they recommend. Yet with this ppl say it‚Äôs political. Wife is vaccinated. I got first shot. Getting 2nd soon. The older generation learned from polio and other stuff that vaccines work. Yet my generation thinks it‚Äôs all a conspiracy. Smmfh all because we didn‚Äôt live thru what the older generation did. Seeing it first hand. Well now we are seeing it
1	For those who appreciate scientific arguments watch Gershom Zajicek M.D, Asymptomatics are protected against coronavirus mutations
1/1	For those who are refusing the vaccine why?It works....
1/1	For those who do not trust the shot. I will take it for you.
1/1	For those who follow and understand science, the answer is yes.
1/1	For transparency and for the peace of mind for everyone, I think we should have Moderna and Pfizer vaccines
0/0/0/0/0	Force me I dare you. I will starve to death in the forest before I take the poisonous Mark of the beast.
0/0	Forced vaccines will be my revolt
0/-1	Forced you say, don't be the one coming to jab me
1/1	Forcing masks or vaccines is a slippery slope & soon they will force us to do other things too!‚Äù When your behaviour impacts other people, that‚Äôs exactly what we do: - driving drunk - second hand smoke - stopping at traffic lights All of these have rules to protect others.
0/0	Forcing people to have invasive medical treatment is wrong.
0/-1	Forcing people to have no options and take the mRNA which has as many serious side effects and blood clots too. If the J&J is a problem you can bet they other two are as well. And govt wants to force people to get these experimental medical products ? Scary
1/1	Forecasters predicting 2 feet of snow in greater Philly area...our first Philly blizzard and our generator has not yet been installed. This could get interesting...Hope I can get to my COVID vaccine appointment on Thursday.
1/1	Forget about all the doubters...they always want the worse or the worst for the whole globe but for me I am already in with the V-sign from here in Kenya! Some guys are always just there to critisize every achievement when they are non-partisan themselves!There is a vaccine out there and I eagerly waith for it...Thank you WHO for the legal approvals after a very very long period of months!
0/-1	Forget the experimental vaccine. We are missing a huge and important piece of data by not having the antibody test readily available. How many of us have already had it? 70% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic- which means the denominator of those infected is likely way bigger than we know - making the actual death percentage completely unreliable.

0/0	From all I've seen and heard the covid vaccine will be the most dangerous there's ever been - and I've seen plenty of vaccine injuries - some I had on internal ventilation in intensive care as a result, others had died as a result.
0/0	From the same people who brought you "just two weeks to flatten the curve".
0/0	From what I can tell it was better hygiene that saved millions of people over the last 100+ years and not vaccinations

1/1	Getting my second dose of Moderna tomorrow morning. With a background in public health and infectious diseases, I have followed the prior development of mRNA delivery technology, and I was delighted that it was applied early to bring vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to market. Now, to see if my immune system will actually develop antibodies unlike during my contact with the virus last spring. I have faith since mRNA is literally telling my cells how to build antibodies and what the virus looks like.

1/1	Getting this Friday. I don‚Äôt care about people trying to scare me out of it cuz I‚Äôd rather not get covid
0/-1	Getting vaccinated after you've had the virus doesn't make sense. After I had shingles i asked my doctor about the vaccine and he said it wasn't necessary as I already had the virus. So what is going on with covid-19 vaccines
1/1	Getting vaccinated also may protect people around you ‚Äî particularly those at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
1/1	Getting vaccinated creates an antibody response, so that you are protected without having to experience the illness
1/1	Getting vaccinated is being part of the solution. Not getting vaccinated is being part of the problem. Be a part of the solution.
0/1	Getting vaccinated is not just about the person getting the shot, it's saving the lives of others if you don't and transfr the disease as a carrier .That should be the message to those who are scared and reluctant .
1/1	Getting vaccinated is safer than getting infected
1/1	Getting vaccinated saves lives. Not getting vaccinated can end lives. Enough said
1/1	Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19
1/1	Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
1/1	Getting vaccined finally!!!
0/0	Gibraltar: Huge surge in 'Covid deaths' after the implementation of 'Covid vaccines' as 4 times as more people die of 'Covid' in three weeks than in the previous ten months since 'Covid' was discovered.
0/0	Gimme a break...could be anything in that syringe.
1/1	Gimme that "blood clot" vaccine. I don't care. I know what covid can do and I'd much, much rather risk the blood clots.
1/1	Gimme that shit. Fill me up baby. I need it
0/-1	Give her the vaccine. She already looks dead. Sick people
0/0	Give it to Bill Gates the creator of vaccines
0/0	Give it to all the politicians and their families first, wait a year and see how they are going on with it
0	Give it to the commies first.
1/1	Give it to the people who want it. Those who think it is not safe, let them device a plan to protect themselves. I for one is ready to be vaccinated when my turn comes up!
0/0	Give it to the pigs first.
0/-1	Give it to the politicians first, the real deal and not saline shots for tv. If they're still alive and not riddled with exotic cancers in 10 years, the shot could be safe. If they all die from it, then we the citizens will be safe. It's win-win.
0/0/0/0	Give me 50 grand ill take it otherwise no
0/0	Give me a break, and count me out. I am educated and made an informed decosion.....NO
1/1	Give me all the vaccines.

0/1	Give mine to Dr. Fauci
0/-1	Give mine to boris johnson
0/0	Give them the vaccine, a lot of jobs will be available after the side effects kick in.
0/0/0	Give vaccine to victim nor healthy innocence.Satan vaccinate your own self with your agents.God is God and God alone is my HEALTH.
1/1	Given a 5% chance of death with COVID, 1 in a million to have non-lethal blood clots with this vaccine is well worth the risk.
0/0	Given how much of a rush there has been to push the vaccine out, I can't say these results surprise me. Normal testing for a vaccine to go into production has been at a minimum 6 years and often takes over 10. My concern is that a rushed vaccine being pushed on people is going to create a whole new flock of anti vaxxers the likes of which we have not seen in the past. Even some of those who typically trust science will be wary that the proper process may not have been followed given the rush and due to the fact such an enormous economical impact is on the line for governments to get people vaccinated. We have some big challenges ahead of us and I hope I am wrong.
1/1	Given that there are people out there who genuinely struggle to believe that the earth is not flat, it's not exactly surprising that plenty don't understand covid either
1/-1	Given that vaccinations have helped people who have "Long Haul" covid symptoms, do you think giving the vaccine to people who are hospitalized might help them?
1/1	Given the millions who've received the vaccine versus those who have reported blood clots, I'd still say the vaccine is safe for the vast majority of people.
1/1	Given their mishandling of vaccines so far, the Morrison/Murdoch government should be trying to source all four major, approved, vaccines. You'd think they would have learnt their lesson that putting all your eggs in one basket is not a great idea. Of course, now that we are languishing at around 100th in the world for vaccine rollout, our negotiating position with the big pharmaceutical companies isn't very strong.
1/1	Giving facts to the ignorant is like giving medicine to the dead
0/0	Giving vaccines to create Zombie.
1/1	Glad I found this video to show my parents! They‚Äôre 88 and 87 and had an appointment to get the vaccine but my anti vac brothers talked them out of it with a videoü§®so I‚Äôm going to play yours for them this morning. Great information!! Thank you for taking the time to make this video!

0/0	Go ahead and take all the doses as much as you can. That does not make it acceptable to many like me. I and my family are vaccinated by the blood of Jesus Christ.

0/0	Go ahead sheep, get your jab and social media likes, you're so brave <3

1/1	Good information my family and I are definitely taking this vaccine.
0/1	Good information! Yet, the contention that post-COVID-19 should get vaccinated is NOT based on evidence but PURE speculation! Also massvacination when infections are high bears risk of immune escape mutations. Who are your advisors?

1/1	Good news I'm going for my Covid vaccine jab today. First step to travelling again..
1/1	Good news for the whole world! Once US is done internally, we will flood world with vaccines and save this world again!
1/1	Good news no doubt, but lets not kid ourselves that these vaccines will be a magic bullet that'll immediately return the world to 'normal'. It'll take months, perhaps even years, to get everyone vaccinated. Covid-19 will become endemic (it's virtually impossible to completely eliminate a virus once it's 'out'), so we'll still have to be careful.
1/1	Good news on the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness in real life!
1/1	Good news that Oxford Vaccine being rolled out today.

1/0	Good though a number of care workers seem to think they would be risking their lives by having it and they've chosen not to pump chemicals into their body whilst tattoos and piercings seem to be the norm!
1/1	Good to hear ... now let's get this covid under control so we can all start living again !!
1/-1	Good to hear JR Spread the word not the virus
1/1	Good to hear JR, I live in the UK and had mine 3 weeks ago how come it's taken this long?
1/1	Good to hear because obviously it would be a waste if the vaccine wasn't bringing the infection rate down. Props to Israel for getting so many vaccinated so quickly.
1/1	Good to hear you had no reaction,,I hope everyone gets vaccinated !
1/0	Good to know the mRNA is "shredded" by the body after a time period. How long does the nanocytes remain in the body?
1/1	Good to know. I had no side effects. And it worried me even though I retired from the medical field.
1/1	Good to see COVID vaccination campaign has also launched in Pakistan today.
0/0	Good to see so many people finally waking up to what‚Äôs really going on here.. United we stand divided we fall.. I know what side I am fighting for and it isn‚Äôt the side of our government ...
1/1	Good work guys! Keep up the vaccine drive!
0/0	Good!!!!We don‚Äôt need it!!!
1/1	Good, I'll be happy to take any of them as my second dose. Seems a sensible idea to test the viability of taking a mix and match approach. I'm certain they will test it thoroughly !
1/1	Good, don't get the shot. natural selection will weed you out. just keep following Trump. more doses for the rest of us.
1/1	Good, let‚Äôs keep rolling out the vaccines now, get back to normal and if necessary roll out more vaccines in the autumn, like we do with flu, and stop making the issue of mutations (that happen anyway) more of an issue than it needs to be.
0/0	Good, nobody wants it. We will resist with force.
1/1	Good- vaccination is our only way out of this emergency.
1	Good. Anti vaxxxers are literally some of the dumbest people along with flat earthers.
1/1/1/1	Good. Hopefully it's up to 2M per day by February.
1/-1	Good. I'm taking it. Evangelical freaks will probably not take it, thinking it's that "mark of the beast" BS though... FORCE THEM.
1/-1	Good. Let natural selection run its course
1/-1	Good. That means I will get it quicker.
1/1	Good. There's lots of vaccine hesitant people who are more comfortable with the J&J vaccine than mRNA. Disagree with them all you want, but the best way to get shots in arms is to get J&J back on the market, not to convince them to get an mRNA shot.
1/1	Good. We will take it!
0/0	Good...no one needs their poison vaccine.
1/1	Goodbye to covid-19! Vaccinated today

1/1/1/1	Got my first today! Can't convince my mother, she says she won't get it because she doesn't know what's in it o.O No amount of scientific proof I lay out in front of her will change her mind. Tomorrow I'm going to tell her to make sure her affairs are in order because if she gets it, it will probably end her. I won't because I'm vaccinated and will have to deal with all the bullshit when she's gone. This actually makes me pretty sad :'(

1/-1	Guys the whole planet is peer reviewing these mrna vaccines right now under micrsopes these are very easy and cheap vaccines to produce
1/1	Guys you only have 1 job to save world! Take the vaccine and end this disease.
0/0	Guys. Don't take the vaccines. I'm sorry but these people can't even create jobs now they have something that may save your life?????
0/0	HA, you forgot death, watch a REAL news channel, here you'll find real side affects that they wont tell you on the BBC
0/-1	HARD PASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
0/0	HELL NO I WOULD NOT TAKE IT
0/0	HELL NO...I would rather DIE before I take that nasty deadly vaccine...Don't you people know that vaccines were never ever intended for humans? Vaccines were for animals only, but that's how they think of us, as ANIMALS, we are their animals...go deep into research and find out for yourselves what vaccines are really all about. If you feed your body the right foods you won't need a nasty vaccine...oregano oil, black seed oil, zinc, iodine, krill oil, Molasses, cinnamon etc etc...these are the things our body needs, along with lots of fruits and vegetables...with them our body lacks nothing...I take them every day.....they strengthen your immune system as well as repair any ailments in the body...I was on doctor's prescribed poison for years, I stopped taking them and started taking the above mentioned oils and foods, now I feel so much better, no side effects at all....There's absolutely NO NEED for vaccines, To hell with the nasty deadly vaccines
1/1	HIV's RNA knows how to elude and destroy the immune system (antiretrovirals are miracle drugs that prevent this destruction, but not the eluding). Moderna's mRNA will teach the immune system to ACT UP, FIGHT BACK, FIGHT COVID! /end
1/1	HOORAY FOR SCIENCE!!!!
1/1	HOORAY! Had the phone call and COVID vaccination booked for weekend! Hope I'm not still snowed in by then! Keeps blowing a blizzard, then sun.
1/1	HOPEFULLY, THE CHILDREN WILL GET THE VACCINES! SEVERELY DISABLED ADULTS, HAVE NOT! SO SAD
0/0	HOW COME persons took the vaccine and had very bad reactions? A lady said she lost all control of her body after taking the vaccine
0/0	HOW STUPID YOU MUST BE TO TAKE A VACCINE NOT EVEN PHARMA BACKS UP. YOU ARE GIVING THEM PERMISSION TO KILL YOU AND HAVE NO REPERCUSSIONS.
1/1	HOW are we supposed to deal with the fckin virus if we dont get vaccinated???
0/0/0	HUMANITY WAKE UP! THAT MASK YOU SEE, IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES PROTECT YOU FROM VIRUSES! the one you use does not work and your government is lying a lot! It's time to STAND UP! ENOUGH is ENOUGH!!

1/1	Had 2nd does yesterday. Slight fever. Some mild body aches for several hours. I'm feeling almost normal now. It's good to feel you immune system kick in to fight the vaccine. I would not want to risk my immune system being overrun by the Covid-19 virus itself.
1/1	Had Astrazeneca 20 days ago. Was ill for 2 days (like a cold). I was told that most ppl get a fever in around 12 hrs and they hit the mark almost in a minute :D Cant wait for the second one to be done with it.
0/0/0	Had Covid, no big deal, body fought it off with no problem. Have the antibodies, need no vaccine.
1/1	Had Trudeau done this last May instead of pandering to the likes of Chi*a we would have our own vaccines by now and able to sell or give to other countries.
1/1	Had about 36 hours of chills, myalgia and fatigue that improved with rest and ibuprofen. I was able to work a full day afterwards. Please get the vaccine if you qualify or when you are offered the vaccine.
1/1	Had absolutely zero reaction to my first Pfizer jab. Had my second on Wednesday and today I'm laid up in bed feeling like a train wreck with swollen tender neck glands. Paracetamol has helped a bit. Hopefully be better by tonight. Still happy to have had the vaccine though

1/1	Had my first #CovidVaccine jab today, the Pfizer version, feeling great and no side effects at all
1	Had my first #vaccination this morning. I felt so relieved and so grateful that I thought I might cry. I've always loved both science and the NHS, but perhaps never quite so much as over the past year. There really is light at the end of the tunnel for us now, isn't there.
1/1	Had my first COVID Vaccine after placement today ... very grateful
1/1	Had my first Jab about 7 weeks ago, No Pain or Side Effects at all. Everyone Please get their Jabs & help keep all the Rest of the People Safe
0/1	Had my first Jab about 7 weeks ago, No Pain or Side Effects at all. Everyone Please get their Jabs & help keep all the Rest of the People Safe.
1/1	Had my first Moderna shot yesterday at 4pm. Around 11 pm, the vaccination shot site was pretty painful. Now, the next morning, it's definitely worse. Big knot in my arm and visible swelling. I'm glad I was able to get it but not loving life right now.

1/1	Had my first dose a few weeks ago. Hopefully 2nd dose soon.
1/1	Had my first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine this morning. Really well organised by my GP surgery and didn‚Äôt feel a thing with the jab. I‚Äôm currently about 2 hours out and l no side effects this far. I‚Äôll update this if/when I get any.
1/1/1	Had my first dose of the moderna vaccine. So very grateful. Eight hours later and so far I only have a sore arm at the site of injection. My nurse had an amazing hand, didn‚Äôt even feel it.

1/1	Had my first shot of #COVID19 vaccine today.
1/1	Had my first shot yesterday absolutely no side effects ..the 2 shingles vaccines I got last febuary were much worse I definitely had reactions too those ..covid one was a breeze
1/1/1/1	Had my jab last Tueday without hesitation. Our scientists have been positive about the vaccine for a while and I've had, and continue to have, a huge amount of faith in them. Sad to see some European politicans ignoring their own scientitsts and this is damaging the vaccine effort in Europe.
1/1	Had my second Oxford Jab yesterday . No probs. 79 and not in the best of health but quite happy to be vaccinated!
1/1	Had my second dose a week ago. I'm so relieved to have gotten it, as I see the death toll and permanent injuries rising due to this disease. Wear your mask, wash your hands, social distance, and get vaccinated! That is how we will defeat COVID

1/1	Had our first shot of Phizer two days ago, husband and I have no side effects, not even a sore arm. Both of us didn‚Äôt feel the needle go in. The flu shot gives us a sore arm for a couple of days. Very happy we got it! Can‚Äôt wait for the second dose.
1/1	Had the Covid vaccine staff were brilliant.

1/1	Had the first shot already - arm felt like it had been punched for a few days. I requested a couple of vacation days for when I get that second shot. If I have flu-like symptoms, I'll tuck in, eat hot soup, doze and watch movies; if not, I'll get my spring cleaning done. Win-win!
1/1	Had to go home from work after the second shot but had lab confirmed antibodies the next week
0/0	Hah the news guy said no side affects, lies,many people i knew who took it got all mangled up on side effects, so im glad they are standing up for thier rights
0/-1	Haha! ‚ÄúYour gambling if you don‚Äôt vaccinate.‚Äù My response: your gambling with much greater odds of harming your child if you do vaccinate!

0/0	Hank Aaron took the vaccine to show the black community it's safe, dies 17 days later after second dose.
0/0	Hank Aaron took vaccine to show black Americans there's nothing to fear. He dead. Why would I take a vaccine for a virus with a recovery rate of 99.7% The only virus is the deep state globalist. Shot in the arm or shot in the head, either way they want you dead.
0/0	Hank Aaron's tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of #COVID #vaccines. He received the #Moderna vaccine on Jan. 5 to inspire other Black Americans to get the vaccine. #TheDefender
0/0	Hank Arron died 5 days after taking it, and has anyone seen the nurse that passed out on live TV after taking it ?
1/1	Happily threw my mask away. Vaccinated and trusting the science.

1/1	Happy "2 Weeks Post-Second Vaccine" to me!
1/1	Happy Friday everyone. Good news related to most recent nursing home covid data. Cases and deaths are continuing to trend down. Some of the most recent decline may relate to early vaccine efforts in certain states.

1/1	Happy you were able to be vaccinated! I am immunodeficient and don't have a spleen and am signed up and waiting!
0/0	Hard pass for me. I‚Äôm not getting the vaccine. I have a God given natural immune system. If I get it, I will do my best to fight it. If not, Jesus take the wheel I‚Äôm heading home.
0/-1	Hard pass on the vaccine
1/1/1/1/1	Hard to believe but I'm actually excited about this this means that vaccines might be starting to be made the right way now
0/-1	Hard to know the long term side effects if you are only looking 1 to 1.5 years ahead.
0/0	Has anyone actually read up on these "Vaccines" look up how it slices your DNA and mutates it...
1/1	Has anyone been hospitalised or died from Covid after taking the AZN vaccine, either from the trials or since approval? If the answer is No, then the statistic as it stands is correct. If the answer is Yes, please share the link that disproves this.
0/-1	Has anyone mentioned that these so called vaccinations are still on clinical trials until 2022/2023. Surely, if we want to take part that‚Äôs up to us but we shouldn‚Äôt be pushing or encouraging others to participate!!
0/0	Has anyone yet mentioned these are not really vaccines, rather they supposedly minimise the effects of COVID if you get it. There is no evidence that if you're vaccinated you don't pass on the disease as supposedly asymptomatic people do. Oh well...
1/1	Has common sense completely yeeted out the window!?
0/0	Has he had the vaccine üíâ? He can have mine for free!
0/0	Has no one ever wondered why it is that the media never seems to mention alternatives to vac cines; like Vitamin b3 and magnesium?(research Vitamin b effect on Cytokine immune system) Why is this so? Censorship? For what purpose? For whose again? People do for self. Grow your own food. hashtag pushback.
0/0	Has the vaccine been tested on pregnant women because the timeline suggests it has not
0/0	Has there been enough testing?
0/0	Has there been enough time to test the side effects?? All this is evil.
0/0	Hasn‚Äôt been enough time to know what will happen. I‚Äôll pass
0/-1	Hate needles üò©üò≠
0/0	Hate the fucking mask ‚Äî I‚Äôm very frustrated with the lack of clear scientific explanations or transparency, accountability... A vaccine that is being mass-trialed on the population...
0/0/0/0	Hate the war on drugs, not the people using them. Prohibition hasn‚Äôt prevented drugs from entering the country or people from using them. It‚Äôs actually created more dangerous drugs, overdose, addiction and stigma. The war on drugs isn‚Äôt ending harms, it‚Äôs causing them!
0/0	Hate to be the one to say it but nobody knows whats in those syringes, it could be any shot. Just trying to condition us to take it
1	Have a great deal of confidence in scientists.
0/-1	Have a jab and be free but I should be free with or without being part of an experiment.
1/0	Have all these fools come work in the hospital with us healthcare workers. See what it‚Äôs actually like on the frontlines. Because the bimbo sitting in her mansion is so out of touch with reality she has no idea what‚Äôs going on. ‚ÄúNo evidence of a pandemic‚Äù
0/0	Have anaphylaxia. Have a list of allergies. My doctor, thank God, says no way Jose. And if she would not have said that, I would have said that on my own. My coworker's mom took the first shot to Pfizer and within 30 seconds after had a code blue heart attack. They revived her. But she was in a coma for 2 weeks as her kidneys and liver began to fail. Some how she survived. But when she woke up, she showed signs of mid-stage Alzhiemers.
1/1	Have had both of mine, feel so relieved. Everybody please get the vaccine so we can get back to some sort of normal.
0/0	Have not taken it nor do I plan on doing so. Gates and his croonies will not be able to add me to the statistics who willingly volunteered to be guinea pigs.
1/1	Have people seen how one mutation, eg the one in England, can affect the population? We need vaccinenation to stop this!
1	Have people seen the caos at the hospitals? All of this can be stopped with vaccination
0/0	Have scientists heard of Natural Selection? Unfortunately there will be deaths from a virus, but our bodies have the ability to fight viruses. It may be hard to swallow, but it‚Äôs the truth. Question: Why can‚Äôt you sue these companies that are making the vaccine?
1/1	Have the anti-Vaxxers lost their way to this video? Don't see a lot of down votes. I understand some people are allergic to science and make up any anecdote and conspiracy to deny it.
1/1	Have the life saving vaccine or stay inside forever so you don't potentially infect or kill others . Vaccine equals freedom.
0/-1	Have you been getting any desire to eat brains or has your temperature plummeted recently?
0/0	Have you ever seen a vaccine pushed like this for an illness that has a greater than 99% survival rate? What could this really be about?
0/0	Have you learned nothing from the 1979 Swine flu debacle?! CDC villains are trying to stop herd immunity so they can mandate a rushed vaccine. What‚Äôs it going to be this time? Paralysis? More autism? More cancer (SV40)? Death? This is nuts!!! Natural herd immunity is best!!!
1/1	Have you never read about how diseases like smallpox, yellow fever and polio have been almost eliminated thanks to vaccines. Why is it whole swathes of society have completely forgotten?
1/1	Have you seen the pictures of kids in iron lungs because of polio? VACCINES ARE SAFE AND THEY WORK!!!!!!!!
1/1	Have you tried the COVID-19 vaccine? All the cool kids are doing it! ( Just got my first dose of Moderna! )
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Haven't been vaccinated in 20 years and haven't been sick in 20 years. That's all the proof I need.
1/1	Haven't our nurses been through enough?
0/0	Haven't taken the vax. Won't EVER take the vax. My life, My body! (remember that one?)
0/-1	Haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine yet, but I did get accepted into a Covid community research study. The biggest side effect I‚Äôve noticed so far is smugness that lingers for several days.
0/0	Having a strong immune system, not being obses, and taking care of your health is the best way to protect yourself from covid not Vaccine .
1/1	Having a vaccine that is somewhat effective is better than no vaccine at all
1/1	Having had COVID-19 March during the first wave I‚Äôll happily have the vaccine please
1/1	Having mine tomorrow morning - absolutely no hesitation.
0/0	Having worked in patient record systems, I can attest that adverse reactions are massively underreported

0/0	He don‚Äôt even vaccinated his kids, why is he giving this poison? Oh I forgot it‚Äôs all about population.
0/0	He even says ...‚Äôacts just like our immune system...‚Äô WE ALREADY HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM, so WHY would we need dirty gates mRNA vaccines , we don‚Äôt, NOT required

0/-1	He said protect you against sars cov 2?
0/0	He said the vaccine is safe but doesn't care in Norway or other countries people died from the vaccine.
0/0	He said we need to trust the vaccine lol coz we can't trust anything they have said so far . Keep your vaccine
0/0	He's a doctor who understands "immune escape" and the problems that can arise with mass vaccination campaigns. He also knows this is gene therapy and not a vaccine, yet he's on the news wanting everyone to get "vaccinated" with an experimental intervention. THIS IS EVIL AT ITS FINEST. Look at his dead eyes, there is no soul with a moral compass in there.
1/1	He's lucky to have his vaccine, I'm at risk, I'm 59 years old and I don't have a vaccine, bravo!!!!
0/-1	He's not an essential worker! Back of the line joe

1/1	Health care worker here. Words can't describe how happy I am! This is one of the greatest scientific achievements of the century and I can't wait to get the vaccine once it comes out!
1/1	Health care workers have courageously stepped up and have worked around the clock on the front lines and have born the brunt of caring for and watching over half a million people die from this scourge. They have been simply heroic in putting their own lives and loved ones lives in jeopardy for over a year. And they have cared for everybody no questions asked about ignoring mask mandates and gathering in large groups. Any sick person is cared for by these folks. We all owe it to these scientists and honorable professionals to get the vaccine so they don't have to continue to work around the clock and try to save people from dying. It won't end until 70% of Americans are vaccinated.
1/1	Health doesn‚Äôt come in the form of a vaccine. It literally does though?
1/1	Health experts generally agree that the mixing and matching of the vaccines should be safe.
1/1	HealthAccessTp explains no shortcuts were taken to approve #CovidVaccines. Pfizer & Moderna trials had proper sample sizes of 30,000 individuals each. Side effects were properly monitored for 60-days during the trial period. Millions have now been vaccinated, let's celebrate.
0/0	Healthcare workers know better than anyone the truth about the virus, they don‚Äôt see a dire need for a vaccine.
0/0/0	Healthy immune systems do not require, rushed unproven vaccines.
0/0	Healthy nurse (35) gets encephalitis after Pfizer vaccine and dies. She was previously given Pfizer's corona vaccine. When Rachel McKinney came across as confused and struggling to talk, she was sent to hospital. There, a scan showed that she had inflammation in the brain.
1/1	Healthy people taking the vaccine allows for people with compromized immune systems to live normal lives. Stop beeing so selfish people!
0/0	Hearing that the person got Transverse myelitis and paralysis of hands and feet. It would not be the first time that these type of sars vaccine had that side effect. We have to wait
0/0	Heartbreaking. 23 people died within days of 1st Pfizer dose. 13 deaths due to common reactions, incl. fever/nausea, ‚Äúmay have contributed to fatal outcome in some frail patients".

1/1	Hello sir. I have been watching you since the beginning of this madness, and I finally got my vaccine yesterday. In our state in the US, they opened up the age range to 16 and over. Felt a little under the weather for a few days but I finally feel like there is an end now. Whew!
1/1	Hello! I was waiting for you information on this vaccine. Thank you, always appreciate the science and research that you convey in your videos. Greetings from South Florida....
0/0	Hells NO!!!!
0/0	Hells NO!!!! I aint taking no shot
0/0	Hence the adverse reactions. Everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s genetic make up differs. This nano tech can deduce each one. I think not. Common sense
1/1	Her being against vaccines because she had a bad reaction, is like someone say is against exercise and is bad for you, because she sprained her ankle once.
1/1	Her research that started 10+ years ago has lead to the science that developed the MessengerRNA which is how Pfizer & Moderna were able to be developed in record time......Thank you for your work that is saving lives!
0/-1	Herd immunity exists through vaccination, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. Second, this is a corona virus, we don‚Äôt typically see vaccines for corona viruses, because you can contract them over and over again, like the common cold. Getting it once does not make you immune.
1/1	Herd immunity for the win
0/1	Herd immunity is great if it's through vaccines. Herd immunity without immunisation is just letting everyone get infected. Literally no rational person can find logic in that.
1/0	Herd immunity is our way out of this crisis!
0/0/0	Herd immunity. You need the young and healthy to get herd immunity. The Mrna vaccine is giving people covid. This was always about the vaccine and getting it out as a human trial a experiment. For most people this is 99.8% survivable so only the diseased and elderly need extra protection. However, this lockdown and destruction of our lives and our currencies and our continued TYRANY from leaders is not tolerable. GIVE IVERMECTIN or GIVE HCQ NOW along with zinc and D and stop this terrorism of the people NOW!
1/1	Herd-immunity is the only way to fight the virus, take the vaccine
0/0	Here are my concern. These vaccine giants are owned by business people(Pfizer, AstraZeneca, moderna and etc) meaning they only care about profits instead of health. 2nd the government lied to us so much that it's really sickening for example the food pyramid,the 5 senses of the tongue, heck we don't even know where the Spanish flu came from but no they have to censor it. 3rd the CIA is for sure backing up these to torture people. Hello Tuskegee experiment? Anyone ?. Doctor if you can manage to answer my concerns it would be nice . Lastly. How did they eradicate the Spanish flu ? So if we did it before even when the vaccine wasn't even available at that time don't you think we can do it now ? Especially if our technologies got advanced more ? Doctor if you can manage to answer my concerns I would be happy. If my concerns get deleted then know it wasn't me and that is very concerning.
1/-1	Here in Bosnia I had already seen several cases of rheumatic fever and a case we thought was miliary tuberculosis, diseases now rare in America. It was sobering to think that the mundane process of vaccinating these children might ultimately save more lives than any UN-brokered peace treaty.
1/0	Here in Brexitland we need a vaccine against the far-right taking over. Then we can ditch brexit and get back some humanity instead of all this populist 'euro-hate'.
1	Here in brazil people think that the vaccine will turn humans into aligators lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
0/0	Here is a great idea. You do you and I'll do me and you can do the vaccine if you want it and I will not if I don't want it. Free choice!
0/0	Here is how this pandemic of corona virus works: 1- medical billionaires with scientist create a virus in labs 2- they release the virus 3- they make a vaccine 4- they urge gov to sell the vaccine 5- they make billions by making everyone get a vaccine
0/1	Here is what you need to know, it has a lesser survival rate than Covid itself. Continue on!
0/0	Here we are now with more questionable deaths after the shot~~. #RIPHAGLER #RIPAARON
0/0	Here we are witnessing us humans being tested like Guinea pigs :| (Dont get the vaccine)
0/0	Here's a personal anecdote of mine: once my grandma was turned into a rocket because of the Tetanus vaccine. She ended up flying away to live a better life. After she reached outer space and said her goodbyes, the government counted her as a covid death
1/1	Here's a thought, the last time there was a pandemic this dangerous, they had no vaccines and had to go the herd immunity route. 30 million people died and that without the modern transport infrastructure and a world population far less than it is now. So, anti-vaccers, my question would be what would an acceptable final death tally be for you?
1/1	Here's hoping everyone who can will get this vaccine! Who wouldn't want to reduce their chances of serious illness?
1/1	Here's my @PostOpinions op-ed on the Johnson & Johnson #covid19 #vaccine pause. Biggest takeaway: I hope that people feel even more reassured about vaccine safety, because they see how quickly, carefully & transparently our regulatory agencies are.
0/0/0	Here's the reason I'll refuse to take it, and it didn't dawn on me until just last night: How were we able to come up with a vaccine for a brand new disease in 9 months, yet scientists have been trying to centuries (and still haven't succeeded) to find a cure for cancer?
0/0	Here's the reasons I'll never get the vaccine. 1) c19 data isn't scary 2)I don't trust big pharma and their paid Scientists. Especially when they, big tech and the media ban other Scientists from speaking 3) The constant lies from corrupt Scientists and politicians 4)I'm not 75 with heart and lung issues. Cheers
0/0	Here's why I can't compare them, cause I won't be taking any of them...more fear mongering & J&J pushing for acceptance of their magical elixir along with the other companies' magical elixirs so they can get paid too...they can't get their share of the fear mongering market they've created if people look at their efficacy rating & don't understand why the other magical elixirs could be, in theory at the very least, equally ineffective as their magical elixir...makes perfect sense when you think about it...
0/0	Heresy in 21 century. One cannot ask questions about pfizer vaccine. It actually says a lot. A silence louder than words....
1/1	Here‚Äôs the thing though. If everyone decided to not get a vaccine over the 1 in a million risk or whatever, the chance of getting COVID in the next few years is probably north of 50% since it wouldn‚Äôt go away. Not getting a vax over side effect concerns is very selfish. It‚Äôs basically ‚Äúeveryone else take the 1 in a million risk and I‚Äôll reap the benefits of herd immunity‚Äù
1/1	Here‚Äôs to all the morons that think that COVID is a hoax üëè Why is it so damn hard to just follow the rules? Wear a mask, social distance. Let‚Äôs stop the spread and hope that 2021 is much better than 2020.
1/1	Here‚Äôs your daily reminder: take whatever vaccine you are offered. Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&J- they‚Äôre all good & being regulated. You‚Äôd rather have the vaccine than COVID, and vaccines are a major part of how we end this crisis & return to mixing/socialising & an open economy.

1/1	Hi WHO thanks for your Important information about Vaccination of Covid 19.
1/1	Hi y‚Äôall! I personally received the vaccine and I made a video about my day and my experience! If this is something that y‚Äôall are interested in come check it out and subscribe for updates!
1/1	Hi! COVID ICU nurse here! Thank you so much for making this video, it is so important to address all the absolute ridiculous misinformation out there. Had my second dose of Pfizer over a week ago, felt a little flu-like for 24 hours, and since then I‚Äôve been 100% fine. I am so thankful to have been able to be vaccinated and hope once it is available to the general public they will be grateful too
1/1	Hi, I received my vaccine yesterday, AstraZeneca, I'm feeling a bit roppy today but I'm ok ‚ù§üëç
1/1	Hi, l am 71yrs old and had my second vaccine and so did my husband and we have had no pain at all , so everyone can stop worrying, go get that shot .
1/1	Hi, this video is amazing (going to use it to explain vaccines to my mom). I would just appreciate it if you could write an update in the bio or something? Like which types of vaccines are the new covid vaccines and the thing I am most interested in is: what are the dangers!? I don't feel like any videos highlight the dangers of each? (I want to reassure my mom that we will not die/ become autistic lol).
1/1	Hi. I had a blood clot during pregnancy. And I would still take the J&J vaccine. Nothing in life is without risk, especially pregnancy or pregnancy w/ COVID.
0/0	High amount of vit. C, Zinc and Vit. D. And you'll be fine.
1/-1	Highly specific delivery of antigens to target cells and high expression of antigen after vaccination

1/-1	Holy shit... So if a fourth wave doesn't happen, then when can we expect to be back to normal? Haven't gotten mine yet so not sure on everything
0/0	Honestly I‚Äôm very worried about This vaccine. We were rushing to make this vaccine and it was ready in less then a year which is too fast and we should have waited more to see the after affect of the vaccine.
1/1	Honestly it‚Äôs worth it to get the covid vaccine just for the tiny little crumb of socialized medicine
1/0	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger.
1/1	Honestly preventing a severe case is what we need. Eradication isn‚Äôt realistic at this point.
1/1	Honestly though. Pro vax people (like myself) trust them because of the good risk assessment ratios. If it‚Äôs 99% reliable, I will be more focused on that 99% than that other 1%
0/-1/0	Honestly you'd better hope they tested it and it doesn't have any drawbacks once they give it to people. If it's safe for everyone regardless of genes, go ahead then.
0/0	Honestly, I prefer to get COVID-19 again. Those were my covid symptoms for one day. Looks like the vaccine is worse than the virus itself
0/0	Honestly, I will never get the vaccine. Not because it doesn't work but because it's just ignorant. It's like putting a cast on your knee because you scratched it up when you fell. A simple scratch isn't nearly serious enough to get a cast. Same for the virus, a simple cold isn't enough for a vaccine. I just can't wait until the vaccine is available to everybody so that I can't be blamed for giving people the virus.
0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies.
0/0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies. Humans aren't guinea pigs and regardless of what you say here, plenty of bad side effects have been reported.
0/0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies. So many side affects of the vaccine
1/1	Honestly, a few minutes ago, i had this similar argument with someone. I discussed about the fuctions of vaccines in general and how the immune system works, etc. He threw some religious BS argument (that God created the our perfect immune system, etc. Im not against religion btw) and, what i surmised, are conspiracy theories, etc. As a nurse, and as a health care provider, its frustrating coz his kind of mind-set, his thinking, is making it hard for us (health care workers) to educate the public.
1/1	Honestly, been waiting for this vaccine since freaking March, when we all got shut down
1/1	Honestly, i understand the anti vaccines side, but saying that these vaccines are unsafe is not true, its safe depending on if you have a certain reaction to them, or not.
1/-1	Honestly, i understand the anti vaccines side, but saying that these vaccines are unsafe is not true, its safe depending on if you have a certain reaction to them, or not. And if you are safe but still dont use them because of this reason... It doesnt make any sense since you're not affected.
1/1	Honestly, it's the first time in forever that everyone around me is cautiously optimistic about life. The relief of living normally again will probably cause me to cry.
1/1	Honestly, just make it required for everything. The government requiring it where they can, and insurers making everyone else require it.
1/1	Honestly, this situation makes me MORE confident in the COVID vaccines in general.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Honestly, when the Coronavirus vaccine becomes available I‚Äôm going to be so happy. The disease killed my grandfather and if I can stop another family from going through the same pain then I‚Äôm down.

1/1	Hope we can have Pfizer vaccine as well too here in the Philippines
1/-1	Hopefully "at least 6 months" turns out to be "over a year" once we have more data.
1/1	Hopefully FUNDING made the vaccine production faster. Isn‚Äôt it amazing what science can do when it has money? Let's take it then!
1/1	Hopefully I don't catch covid and die before I get one!

1/1	Hoping we will end this soon with those vaccines..
1/1	Horrifying to see all anti-vaxxers, we need to be positive to the vaccine in order to get back our normal.
1/1	Horror fact : synthetic viruses during wars can always bring back eradicated diseases :-O Good to have vaccines , just in case.

As we watch and wait there "RARE" will not be so rare because there will be more deaths. They don't report the deaths to us just the rare ones.

0/0	How stupid you should be to take something in your body with NO known long term effects. A lot stupid.
1/0	How surprising that there were no doctors or medical professionals on the skeptical side
1/1	How the fuck are people anti vax with this specific vaccine but blindly take any other?
0/0	How the hell this vaccine was allowed to roll out this fast is incredible.
0/0	How they can come up with vaccines faster then the making of face mask???
0/-1	How they fight the new mutant variants you have no idea!!
0/0	How this whole situation has been handled doesn't lead me to have the most faith.
0/0/0	How to trust a vaccine that was so hurriedly developed? How to trust a government to be truthful about it? Very hard for some people to believe in this. What is the content of the vaccine?
0/0	How vaccines work? Sure, ... inject you with toxins that hurt you, and make you part of the list of people who may die from this covid that is searching for the right person?
0/0	How was it tested in a large scale against the new variants ;; you told us that they haven‚Äôt been around for long , I trust my immune system , Thanks üôè
0/0	How were millions persuaded to take a radical new cell-altering injection which is still at the trial stage??? The power of propaganda is immense. The fact #BillGates, Depopulation King, funds the jab should be enough to raise the alarm!
0/0/0/0/0/0	How will life saving blood transfusions affect those who receive blood from a vaccinated person? I'm not sold on M-RNA, we do not know long term effects on how it will affect our DNA. It's irresponsible not to question this. I'll take my chances on natural immunity.
0/0	How would you ever know if a Covid-19 vaccine works or not when there are no symptoms or harmful effects from contracting it?
1/1	How y‚Äôall scared of the vaccine but not scared of Covid Face with raised eyebrow,
0	Hows the johnson-johnson vax workin? There is 0 proof that mRNA has ever been effective for anything ever. My friend had Moderns shot- 5 weeks later got covid. Its a matter of time before each vaccine gets pulled from the market (just like astrazeca and johnson-johnson) which were considered SAFE A MONTH AGO.
1/1	Huge sense of relief for the whole family by vaccine
1/1	Huge thank you to all involved in vaccine development and deployment- my partner Caroline has her first dose, wonderful team at St James Portsmouth
1/-1	Huge thank you to all the dedicated healthcare workers for all their bravery and support during this difficult time.
1/1	Huh...we actually use a'lot of medications from Pfizer at our closed door, private pharmacy. Politics aside, I hope this is the first step to normalcy. I just want to go back to Disneyland and want Comic-Con and Wrestlemania back.
1/1	Humanity has always benefited from new technology, mRNA vaccines is new technology. New things always scare some people but the pros far outweigh the cons
0/0	Humans have been living 1,000s upon 1,000s of years without vaccines and they were fine.
0/0	Hundreds have died from taking the vaccine
1/1	Hundreds of thousands are dead. Just because the majority aren‚Äôt dead doesn‚Äôt stop it from being a big deal. A majority of Americans weren‚Äôt killed on 9/11, for example.
0/0	Hurd immunity, so why take vaccine if i can still get COVID anyway, NO THANKS ,give it to the SHEEP I'm good,
1/1	Hurry up

1/1	I (38) just got vaccinated (1 shot) in Jerusalem.
0/0	I 100% agree with your logic. I am getting tired of this new "Im vaccinated" trend happening everywhere. While everyone is touting vaccination as some passport to normal life, theres alot of us that don't need a pill or shot because our body's are the best defense against illness. The problem is we are still a society that wants a quick fix or to spend money for results instead of putting in the hard work of being truly healthy.
0/0	I AINT TAKING THAT BULLSHIT!!!!
0/0	I AM Antivaccine!These are NOT Vaccinations,therefore i really am against it!
1	I AM VACCINATED!
1/1	I AM a person living w/ cancer. I WILL advocate for those living w/ cancer to live better & longer. RIGHT NOW, that means fighting for pp w/ cancer to get #COVIDvaccine. None of the cancer science progress will have mattered if COVID kills us. We're high risk even if <65!
1/1	I AM getting the vaccine today - gladly. Anyone who refuses it is a fool.
0/0	I Absolutely refuse to get it under any circumstance
0/0	I BET BILL GATES IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THIS DOCTOR HOLDING UP CUE CARDS AND HIS THUMBS UP WITH EVERY SENTENCE.

1/1	I JUST HIT 70 YEARS LAST OCTOBER AND SURPRISINGLY I RECEIVED AN INVITATION FOR OUR VACCINE HERE IN QUEBEC. I HAVE HEARD OF A TOTAL MESS IN OTHER PROVINCES BUT IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AT OUR NEW "GLEN SITE" FOR APRIL 4TH. I WISH ALL OTHER LOCATIONS ON OUR PLANET WERE AS EFFICIENT!!!
1/1	I NEED MY J &J POWER CYNANIDE SHOT NOW !!! WHERE IS IT AVAILABLE !!!
0/0	I READ THE LAB STUDY THEY ARE NOT TELLING YOU..DON'T TAKE IT! ABSOLUTELY NOT. I READ THE LAB STUDIES. THIS IS A DRUG, THERE IS TREATMENTS FOR COVID. WHY WOULD I PUT THE CRAP THAT IS IN THE COVID19 DRUG THAT is HAZARDOUS TO MY HEALTH. THERE IS A 99.6 SURVIVAL RATE FROM COVID, AND MANY BAD SIDEFFECTS, IT PERHAPS LIFE LONG, AND DEATHS FROM THIS SO-CALLED DRUG! IT CAN CAUSE YOUR NUREO TUBE TO SWELL, THINK ABOUT THAT.
1/1	I REALLY HATE THAT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER TO GET IT!!!!!
0/-1	I REALLY appreciate that Dr. Yasmin made the distinction between Anti-Vaxers and Vaccine-Hesitant. Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0/0	I Rather die than taking the vaccine
1/1	I SINCERELY HOPE #VACCINATION RECORD CARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS LEGITIMATE CITIZENS. If you're still fighting against vaccines after 2020, do the world a favor and just die. We don't have time for your bullshit anymore. Just...just fuck off. Thx

0/0/0/0	I WOULD RATHER LIVE ON A CYBER DUMP THAN TAKE THIS
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I Will Get Vaccine
1/1/1/1	I absolutely love this race in the scie clinic world. But I an hopeful this movement opens more pathways to other viral treatments. Like hiv or flu
1/1	I actually find it interested that over 50,000 in the army had covid but only 21 of them died
1/1	I actually think the Covid vaccine should be mandatory. When I was a kid all students were given tuberculous vaccines in school. Why? Because it was a contagious deadly disease and a risk to public health. No debate. You took the shot. This should be no different.
1/1	I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind doing this, I‚Äôm already going to be exposed to the virus in school so why not get infected willfully in a controlled environment?
1/1	I agree - every person who gets the vaccination is another break in the chain of contagion.
0/0	I agree 100% This vaccine was produced to fast. I'm not taking it.
1/1	I agree about taking the vaccine, because the alternative is to get covid.
1/1	I agree everyone should take the vaccine.
0/0	I agree with Rui G, there should be more emphasis on a healthy lifestyle than a vaccine. Okay, so you get the vaccine, but you die from High Blood Pressure and Diabetes!!!!
0/-1	I agree with her cause I see nothing in my area at all
1/1	I agree with this point of view, we should believe in vaccines, the virus will get better
0/0	I agree with you I'm against this vaccine!
1/0	I agree with you. The UK Govt initially distanced themselves from the Russian vaccine, it now seems its efficacy is somewhat higher than the AZ vaccine. Mabey we should have placed orders with the Sputnik vaccine.
1/1	I agree. Let's get them done. We have the vaccines available to get all nurses and all teachers done.
0/0	I agree. Usually clinical trials take at least 9 years to gather robust safety data (observation for side effects) in a variety of various patient groups (elderly, children, pregnant women, patients with specific health conditions, etc.), but this vaccine as been rushed through by the health authorities and granted marketing authorisation (permission to be administered to patients) at such a breakneck speed, it is of a grave concern. That is why we do not need a similar situation as was seen in thalidomide.
0/0	I ain't foolish enough to take the first shot, nevermind a third one. # SATANS SERUM. #JESUS SAVES
0/0	I ain't getting it. Its not tested.

0/0	I ain‚Äôt putting anything they give me in my body.
0/0	I almost burst out laughing when they used Dolly Parton to promote their evil vaccine . " Look here, if she takes it then it must be the right thing to do" .
1/1	I almost died of flu 7 years ago. Believe me I'll take whatever side effects may possibly happen vs going through what I went through.
1	I almost forgot about how much I loved meeting random weird groups of people while going out w/ my friends, always ending up at some random taco shop (or Denny‚Äôs) at the end. Swapping Snapchat‚Äôs and never seeing them again. I feel like I took it all for granted but those times are coming back soon enough!!
1/1	I already got both shots, all it did was get me sleepy but I feel ok
1/0	I already had Covid in January it wasn‚Äôt fun and I still have side effects now from it so I‚Äôm looking forward to this one dose vaccine.
0/0	I already had a positive covid test and know how my body reacts to the infection and it wasn't bad! Who needs a vaccine?
0/0	I already had covid and still have the antibodies why would I need a shot.
1/1	I already had covid back in January so the vaccine made me feel like I had it again for a day. And a sore arm for a few days.
1/1/1/1	I already had covid but I‚Äôm still getting the vaccine in few days, need my life back
0/0	I already had covid-19, I‚Äôll just enjoy my natural immunity rather than get vaccinated.
0/-1	I already had covid. Felt like the flu. Take it if you want. But i will pass. I don't need a drug to beat something that i already beat on my own.,
1/1	I already had the johnson & johnson vaccination and so far good no issue's. It will be a month now in April the 9th. Im 70 years old. With underline conditions.
0/0	I already have a perfect designed immune system so I pass. I've never heard of a single person since the virus was discovered talked about good nutrition to prevent a disease. Vaccines has done more harm than good that's the truth.
0/0	I already know that I will never get one because I would like to die a natural death....
1/0	I already mentioned they had to genetically engineer the vaccine to save time. The old way of making a vaccine takes too long, and liberals along with their friends in the mainstream media wanted a vaccine ASAP and were pushing for it, but believed the Trump administration could not make it as fast as claimed, and President Trump is the type of guy that loves to prove people wrong. In fact the vaccine would not have been able to be made so fast if the Trump administration did not remove the regulations that would have slowed down the process. Trump was originally pushing for Therapeutic drugs. Remember whatever Trump is for liberals go against, and change the narrative. They made people think there were no alternatives to treating the virus, and vaccine was the only hope meaning the drugs the Trump administration approved were working. Problem is they made it difficult for doctors to prescribe them, and recommended for emergency use only for the general public.
1/0	I already told my doctor the second they have one for me I want one lol
1/1	I also believe vaccines help to prevent deaths.
1/1	I also can‚Äôt wait to get the vaccine I currently have COVID and it sucks and I missed Christmas one thing about working in retail you can possibly get COVID
0/0	I also dislike to add foreign RNA to my body. Why is that weird to media.
1/1	I also got mine in January!! Best thing I ever did!
1	I also got the second dose of the astra-Zeneca Covid #vaccine this morning!! Woo it‚Äôs been 8 hours and so far I‚Äôve had no side effects at all, so that‚Äôs great! #getvaccinated #·¥†·¥Ä·¥Ñ·¥Ñ…™…¥·¥áss·¥Ä·¥†·¥á ü…™·¥†·¥ás
1/1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes.
1/1/1	I also heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
1/1	I also plan on getting the vaccine as soon as I am eligible to do so. Stay Safe
0/0	I always believe the opposite of what governments push. They say there's a pandemic so I know there is no pandemic. They want everybody to take vaccines so I will never take vaccine.
0/0	I always reacted to the flu vaccines, I am not getting the vaccine. I would rather get Covid
1/1	I always vacccinate
1/1	I am 100% pro vaccine though! ~ I would rather deal with a day or two of minor side effects then have to go through covid and possibly have long term issues from it! (also I had no side effects after the first dose, so I was very lucky, this time not so much)
1	I am 100% pro vax. But tbf the percentage of the population, especially boomers, that is on multiple daily drugs is insane and makes me question the medical industry.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I am 100% taking it
1/1/1/1	I am 100% taking it üíó

0/0/0	I am 24, and I am not getting the vaccine, I have already had covid too. It‚Äôs my call, but I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable, especially at my age
1/1	I am 54 and I'm getting my second shot tomorrow ,i went with my mother age 80 3 weeks ago,she was one of the first to be vaccinated.
1/1	I am 60 years old when I will get vaccine?
0/0	I am 71. My son-inlaw is a dr. He won 't get or give the shot. Nor will I takr it. Likewise if I get covid I will take the Ivermectin. I take vit D and have been for many years. Never had a flu vac and haven't gotten the flu. When my husband was working he was required to geg the flu vaccine and always got the flu. Go figure!
1/1	I am 73 and had gotten my first shot of AstraZeneca a week ago. After the process ... I did not feel anything as stated nor did it create any annoyances like mild pain or whatever. I can not remember anything that has bothered me.
1/1	I am 74 and can't wait for mine. It's peace of mind which is very important.
1/1	I am 74 yrs old, received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine last month. I had NO reaction to vaccine whatsoever. If anything, I now have peace of mind !
1/1	I am 75 years old and had 5 excuses for not getting the vaccine. Some were previous health conditions. But yesterday I said what the hell and got the vaccine. I saw all the videos on the pros and cons of all the videos no matter the source. I had zero side effects and zero pain and hardly noticed that anything even happened. No pain, no side effects. Here in Canada, they are slow in getting the second dose. Here the wait for Pfizer is 4 months and not 21 days. Many young people who are still being forced to go to classes are complaining that they cannot get the vaccine and that nobody wears masks in school. Maybe this varies by the school.
1/1	I am 77 and husband 79 we got our 2nd moderna shot on 2/22. All we had was a sore arm and a little tierd for about 24hrs. After that feeling great! I am so thankful for these vaccines.
1/1	I am 78 so if offered the vacine i will have it. I can only blame myself if any thing goes wrong but will to take the gamble

1/1	I am VERY grateful for the vaccines, but will forever be cautious, at least until the youngest of children are protected.
1/1	I am a Jewish. I wish to be vaccinated immediately.

1/1	I am a child born early 60‚Äôs and so lucky that by then Dr Salk had come up with Polio Vaccine and was vaccinated as my 12 siblings & now we are again vaccinated against Covid-19 and we all believe in vaccination
1/1	I am a doctor who cares for complex patients. YES, you should get the vaccine. It is the right thing to do.
1/1	I am a fit 60+ year old with no underlying health conditions and will certainly have the vaccine. The risk of very serious illness and death from Covid rises as we get older and in my age range it is 30 times higher than for 18 to 29 year olds. I don't want to hide away because others decide this thoroughly tested vaccine is unsafe, I also still work and would like some normal life back.
0/0	I am a health care worker and I don't want to take the vaccine right away.
0/-1	I am a little bit hesitant
0/0	I am a nurse and I will not have it, who knows what the future complications are and besides more people are dying since the vaccine has been rolled out!
1/1	I am a nurse and i got the vaccine 5 days ago. I have not noticed any side effects at all, except a sore arm. But it was not that sore, and was only sore for about 1 1/2 days. And, in the past, I have had flu shots that made my arm more sore. I am fit and healthy, and have a pretty strong immune system. I got the vaccine because I am more concerned passing COVID to others and about getting COVID and having long term issues. Many who have gotten only minor illness from COVID have had long term issues with micro clots in thier organs. I just think that is a way worse scenario then any possible side effects from vaccine
1/1	I am a part of the Pfizer vaccine trial. I could have gotten it, or I could have gotten placebo. My doses were done in September and October. There was definitely an afternoon after my second dose where I felt like crap. Very tired, stomach felt gross, wanted to just lay on the couch, and I couldn‚Äôt get my body the right temperature. Sweatshirt made me sweat, but t shirt felt freezing. That lasted until I went to bed that night, then I woke up feeling fine.

1/1	I am a patient facing hospital employee. I have finished my second dose yesterday. Frontline workers are so stressed about getting covid and bringing into their families that they would rather take the vaccine as is. I cannot tell you how stressful it is for the nurses to have more and more positive covid patients showing up on the units. It is physically exhausting to put on your PPE and it is mentally trying when patients are holding your hand asking you not to leave the room. There is a societal obligation and taking the vaccine.
1/1	I am a physician and very PRO vaccine. But there is no reason the government should be forcing anyone to get one against their will.
1/0/0/0	I am a registered nurse. I am being pressured to take the vaccine. I quit and I won‚Äôt vaccinate. I have enuf problems.
0/0	I am a teacher who had been face to face since August and I WILL NOT get these experimental shots!
0/0	I am afraid of the side effects because the testing should take 2 years
0/0	I am against the vaccine, there has not been enough time testing on it, they just want us to be a bunch of guinea pigs
0/0	I am against vaccines simply because of the additives that they put in these vaccines which are known to damage the body, for instance aluminum.
0/0	I am against vaccines since my senior year in hi school , when I had to get ALL my vaccinations or no diploma would be given , I emigrated to this great country , LEGALLY , you cannot come here LEGALLY without proper vaccinations , it never cane up in 13 years till 2 months b 4 graduation , seems odd to me , # NEVER AGAIN , MY BODY , MY CHOICE , btw , I don't wear the ribbon or the masks !!!

1/1	I am amongst the more vulnerable people. Insulin dep. Diabetic. Asthma, mild angina, and fibromyalgia. Locked in since March afraid to go outside. I can't wait to get the vaccine so that I can rejoin the human race again. I hope I don't have to wait to long.
1/1	I am an EMT in the CA bay area and I have both shots of the moderna vaccine. I only had soreness in my arm for both shots with no side effects.
0/0	I am an RN and still have antibodies. I totally agree with you. As long as I have antibodies, I will not get the vaccine. I donate blood products on a regular basis and my blood is tested for antibodies at every donation. Going on 8 mths now!

0/-1	I am at least waiting for a full year. I wanna see what it does to people. I refuse to be a vaccine test dummy.
1/-1	I am autistic, the fact that some parents would let their children die rather than be like me (even though it can't cause autism) is very insulting to be honest
0/-1	I am concern about one thing. Side effects. What are the possible side effects one might get?
1/1	I am confident to take the vaccine
1/1	I am convinced, I will get it.
1/1	I am currently working frontline nursing in the UK.After consulting with many other health pro's,I decided to have the vac.I've already had Covid,back in April 2020.Had the vac last Friday,no issues.
0/0	I am deeply concerned about pushing this vaccine through so fast. I, quite frankly, do not want to take this vaccine until it has been in use for quite some time in order to evaluate the side effect profile and how effective it actually is.
0/0/0	I am definitely NOT getting the vaccine. But what do you guys think is in the vaccine and why tf are they forcing it on us???
1/1/1/1	I am definitely getting the vaccine because I want to go back to work!
0/0	I am definitely hesitant given that the medium/ long term safety data simply does not exist for mRNA vaccinations. The theory behind it and the initial trial results seem beautiful, but I don't feel like myself or my patients being a guinea big for the longer term.
1/1	I am experiencing side effects from the vaccine. Over the last year I have talked to 10 families who lost a loved one. And know others with serious lifetime issues from their experience having Covid. Despite these side effects, I would get the vaccine again. Covid is a bigger risk.
1/1	I am extremely thrilled with what the scientists have achieved. Great job! The world counts on you.
1/1	I am for the vaccine and think it's safe
1/1	I am fully vaccinated now and I have no problems with getting a booster shot each year like the flu vaccine. I want too be safe and not sick. I pray this all comes too an end in a major good way
1/1	I am generally very pro-vaccine, .especially the J&J vaccine, and the AstraZeneca/Oxford one.
1/1	I am getting May second dose tommorow.
1/1	I am getting the first dose of the COVID vaccine on Wednesday. I will be getting the vaccine to protect my family and friends. I will also be getting the vaccine to protect one of my support staff, who has a brother that has a disability which makes him more susceptible to COVID
0/1	I am getting the vaccine. The more I read or hear about it the more I am sure I'll never have it
1/1	I am glad I see finally SCIENTISTS and DOCTOR talking real facts!! for the vaccine and NOT people with no idea about medicine and vaccines.
1/1	I am glad to be halfway through my AZ vaccination program.

1/1	I am happy that I am fully vaccinated. Not just vaccinated from covid, but also, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, pertussis, flu, and others. I have never experienced any ill effects of my vaccinations. More importantly never experienced ill effects from the things I am vaccinated against.
0/1	I am happy to do whatever is recommended, including sprinkling the Pfizer vaccine on my breakfast cereal, if that is what it takes to stay protected.
1/1	I am happy to report that I received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Together, with the help of vaccines, we will defeat this virus. I #TrustScience and you should too.
1/1	I am happy to take the dose of anyone who doesn't want to get vaccinated now!!
1/1	I am having my Pfizer vaccine shot 1 tomorrow this video really made me feel a lot better about it. Update: Shot 1 down. I was definitely nervous but not as bad as other people there. One poor person passed out on line. Overall I felt better after getting it my anxiety went away 15 mins after the shot.
1/1/1	I am having my first AZ vaccine in Sydney today. I‚Äôm in an older age group and the risk/benefit considerations side with going ahead and having it. It‚Äôs important to know about the potential risks - just as important to keep perspective. Thank you John for balanced information üåªüá¶üá∫
0/0	I am healthy and won‚Äôt be getting the vaccine. If I was you, I would stand strong with your personal integrity on this one.
0/0/0/0/0	I am healthy in my 60's. Never had any shots/ vaccines since grade school. Not taking it! Never!

1/1	I am hoping to god that all the logistics work out perfectly and we can stay on track for 20 million people vaccinated in the US by the end of 2020.
0/1	I am hoping to, but not be able to get the vaccine.You see, I have an extreme allergy to chicken eggs, and many vaccines contain pieces of a virus that has been incubated in chicken eggs. Thus, they contain the proteins that I am allergic to.
0/0	I am immunocompromised due to being a transplant recipient. I am hesitant about recieving the vaccine.
1	I am in 1B for vaccination and have no idea what is happening! Complete shambles!
0/0	I am in India and let me tell the whole world - Mass vaccinations are going on here even when hundreds are dying or getting paralyzed within days of vaccination. The media is not covering any of it!
1/1	I am in high risk category and will get it as soon as I am able to. My mother passed away October 8th with covid.
1/1	I am in my seventies and I couldn't care less about side-effects. In any case, it seems that the politicians and the press do not understand how vaccines work. The oral polio vaccine might cause 3 cases per million doses while there are 5,000 per million if not.,
0/0	I am in no hurry. FINISH YOUR TRIALS FIRST
1/1	I am in no way an anti-vaxxer. Hell, I work in the pharmacuetical industry. I have the upmost confidence in the regulatory agencies worldwide and the rigor at which there studies, by experienced players, are going through.

1/1	I am just mad that there will be no long term consequences for being an anti-vaxxer during the pandemic. Siaka will be able to pedal his idiocy unmarred by the experience.
1/1	I am just slowly getting better i had Covid & was in the hospital for a week, it wasn‚Äôt fun and I still have side effects now from it. I‚Äôm looking forward to this one dose vaccine. This virus is scary and i wish more understood. I have not seen my family since the 17th of this month.
0/0	I am kind of scared of the vaccine
0/-1	I am legit more terrified of the vaccine at this point. Especially since it's development just HAD to include some sort of "liability clause" in it so you can't sue anyone involved in its creation, even if there becomes a proven, direct, and irrefutable link between illness/death and the vaccine. You need to sue the government itself.
1/1	I am looking forward to getting mine. Apparently in April
1/1	I am lucky enough to where I work in a field where I can receive the vaccine and I have had both shots and no side affects what so ever.
1/1	I am lucky to have an appointment next week.
0/0	I am more "scared" of the vaccine than I am of dying from Covid, yeah. Well said.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I am never getting vaccinated with this vaccine.
0/0	I am no Antivaxxer conspiracy theorist, but do I really want to trust a vaccine that was developed in 9 months? I know it had to be made quickly but it seems risky rushing out a vaccine like that.
1/1	I am no expert just a messenger, trust the vaccine
0/0	I am no longer 'trying to dig up evidence to prove' vaccines cause autism. There is already abundant evidence....This debate is not scientific but is political
0/0	I am no vaccine skeptic but the speed at which thus vaccine is developed is very very concerning.Condensung years into months will inevitably result in compromises and we dont know the longterm health consequences...
0/0	I am not about to become any part of a genome experiment
1/1	I am not afraid of the vaccine but I hope the next day's sick leave is given after the injection.
0/0	I am not an anti-vaxxer.... I am a multi-dose anti-vaxxer. All you have to do is follow the money. It all started in the 80's. This is not difficult to figure out yet I have never seen it discussed since.
1	I am not anti-vaccine.
0/0	I am not antivax, but these vaccines have not been tested long enough to prove Safety.
1/0	I am not bothered on the opinion of de Pfeffel, with his degree in Greats, on the efficacy of vaccines. Please keep politicians and similar ignorants out of the loop. I want to hear from qualified experts.
0/0	I am not getting a vaccine for a virus that I have a 98% chance of surviving. That is just plain stupid
0/0	I am not getting it. Healthy people don't need this vaccine. Apparently, people re-infected, and all the current rules will stay for us. Even the test is false according to the SDS and WHO.
0/0	I am not getting the shot
0/0	I am not getting the vaccine. Covid19 has 98.9% survival rate. Do you know what the long term effects are from taking the vaccine? No, you don't.

0	I am not taking it!
0/0	I am not taking it, you can give mine to Biden and Harris. I‚Äôll share not greedy. It‚Äôs against my religious beliefs
0/0	I am not taking it. They can't even develop a vaccine for the flu or cold - both coronaviruses. They're both still with us , and we haven't locked down the planet over those. At the very least , I want to see what occurs to all the sheep who rushed to have an unproven vaccine pumped into their system , and see what develops.
0/-1	I am not taking the vaccine if takes my job too
0/0	I am not worried about wearing masks because I used to use them. Personally quarantine and lockdown don't bother me a lot but I think these have been affected small business, so I hope they will be stopped and go back to normal asap. The biggest concern is vaccines and health passport. I am afraid of getting them.
1/1	I am now fully vaccinated and very pleased. I will still mask but I feel much safer.
1/1	I am older and I will take my chances with the vaccine rather than the covid
1/1	I am on the downside run of having Corona (1 quarantine week left) and I wish I had this before I got it. I‚Äôm glad someone is making headway. This virus sucks. So much worse than anything else I‚Äôve had.
1/1	I am one of the fortunate people who has been fully vaccinated. It's liberating being able to take a deep breath and know that you aren't going to spread covid or die from it. It's been on the back of my mind since this all started, but now it's not. Don't be afraid to get the vaccine. It's worth it.
0/0	I am one who will be afraid to take an early vaccine like this. Be careful out there
1/0	I am over 40 with kidney disease, and my husband is over 50 with diabetes. We both got covid back in August along with out kids who live with us. Only had a fever for a couple days and some body aches, but nothing bad. I am a nutritionist and we eat very healthy. We upped our intake of zinc, quercetin, vitamin C, vitamin D3, NAC, selenium, drank lots of water and rested. This doesn't have to be a death sentence even for vulnerable people like us.
1/1	I am over 70 and I am eagerly awaiting the vaccine, any vaccine.
0/0	I am perfectly healthy and don't intend to change that by risking a covid shot. We are NOT in this together. Never have been. Never will be. WHO doesn't want normal to return. They enjoy control.
1/1	I am planning on getting the vaccine myself.
1/1	I am pregnant, I need to take it ..
1/1	I am prepared, but it is not possible to know when one will be vaccinated even though I am 73 years old in a month!
1/1	I am pro vaccination
1/1/1	I am pro vaccination but these companies really do have Fallout series style names...
1/1	I am pro vaccine
1/1	I am pro vaccine and encourage everyone to get it but personal choice matters and we cannot remove hospital access for those who don‚Äôt have it.
1/-1	I am pro vaccine and following the vaccines but will not get it until masks not necessary afterward. If they don't believe enough in the vaccine, neither do i.
1/1	I am pro vaccine but am troubled by mandatory unproven vaccines which are experimental. It is contravening the Nuremberg code.
1/1	I am pro vaccine by the way. Vaccines can have side effects just like every other medical treatment. However low the chance of developing side effects is, It is still more likely than dying from Covid. I am under 20.
1/1	I am pro vaccine, the covid vaccine kinda makes me weary though, my grandpa got it and ended up in the hospital, I of course will still be getting it since my little brother isn‚Äôt able to. We are still waiting for my doctor to get the vaccine in, they said they would call us since they are still waiting. I would iv gotten it the same day I was getting all my other shots (2 for serious stuff and 1 flue) but they didn‚Äôt have it yet.
1/1	I am pro vaccine. However I am worried that to go see a movie or book a flight you will have to show your vaccine card.
0/1/0	I am pro vaccine. I vaccinate myself and my kids. However, this vaccine is just tied to way too much suspicion and there is a lot of stuff in the dark...that we won't be getting the vaccine.
1/1	I am pro vaccine. I‚Äôve had every vaccine I could get and once i have children, I will have them vaccinated appropriately. I am also pro masks. I think they work to reduce viral load. I just want to clear up confusion.
1/1	I am pro vax, pro Biden, pro mask mandates. But I think its laughable to trust government as the sole source of this data.
1/1	I am pro-vaccine. People also need to understand that wanting to get the best vaccine is not that crazy a concept.
1/1	I am proudly vaxxinated. No side effects. :-)
0/0	I am reading this morning that a doctor in Miami and a nurse in Portugal have died after getting the vaccine, and that half of the healthcare workers in California are refusing it. So no, I'm not taking it.
1/1	I am ready for the vaccine whenever my age group is allowed to get. So ready to help America get back to some kind of normal.
1/1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
1/1	I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.
0/1	I am ready! I want a return to normal! I am healthy so I will wait AGES!
1/-1	I am really happy with the way they have talked about this. I myself am quite anxious about that new vaccine. I am otherwise not opposed to vaccines.
1/1	I am really looking forward when the countries are vaccinated 100%

1/1	I am really proud to I say that I live in a country where vaccines are free for everyone ...... I just wish people were more educated about the advantages of vaccine
1/1	I am responsible for her health. I know that immunization will strengthen her immune system which will help her fight other diseases.
0/0	I am safe. thinking you are not safe lowers your immune system. an experimental mRNA vaccine is not the answer. how about finding out how many people will take it b4 investing. should you be able to invest in health? seems kinda wrong. mandatory vaccines is tyranny.
0/0	I am saying no to the COVID-1984 shot. Wait a few months and you will see why.
0/0/0	I am scared because I never had it
0/0	I am scared of needles and that is one of so many reasons I won't get a vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I am scared to. I am also scared for my friends and family i was told 2 doctors died cause of the vaccine.
0/0	I am sceptical to the vaccine when it hasn't been tested for a long time
0/0	I am scheduled to take Moderna- but I am not feeling peace in my heart to take it..
0/0	I am selflessly refusing a vaccine to make sure a person of color gets it before my privileged self. After all, we don't know all of the effects.
1/1	I am seriously hoping this vaccine works, is safe, and can be mass produced as fast as possible for the sake of the entire world. Really rooting for this ‚Äî and all the other ‚Äî teams.
1/-1	I am shocked but not surprised there are anti-Vaxers in the Valley telling people the COVID vaccine will alter their genetic makeup and make them sick. That‚Äôs no good, friends.
0/0	I am shocked that you would get it. Do they know the long term effects of it? 5 years? 10 years? They have only been working on a vaccine for not even a year. It is quite disturbing that they pushed it out so fast.
1/1	I am sitting in observation as I write this, just got my vaccine a few minutes ago. It feels so surreal, honestly I've been holding back tears since getting my approval yesterday. I can't even imagine yet what the relief will feel like in three weeks. I hope everyone will get this opportunity soon, I know I am very lucky and privileged.
1/1	I am sitting out my 15 minutes after getting Pfizer dose 2 rn. Pfizer gang ü§ò
1/1	I am so excited for my child to be protected from this virus.

1/1	I am so excited to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
1/-1	I am so excited. I have the opportunity to receive a shot of a newly developed vaccine which is at best 95% effective on certain variance of the Covid-19 virus or at worst give me a blood clot. All for a 98% survivable disease. \n\nWell, it is a price we all have to pay to re-join the society or to make people \feel\" safer, I guess.",
1/1	I am so glad more people in the U.S. will be able to receive this vaccine.
1/1	I am so glad we have Dr. Fauci. A man of reason.
1/1	I am so glad you will be protected! I am ready to work towards your election in the next gubernatorial election!
1/1	I am so happy for this vaccine
1/1	I am so happy you have had your shot. I have coworkers who have had it twice now, and others who know people who have had it twice. Even if you have had covid it is still worth it to get the vaccine, it will still have good coverage of new strains that will develop.
1/1	I am so incredibly thankful for them and all the people helping to end this pandemic and when it‚Äôs my turn I‚Äôll get a vaccine
1/1	I am so jealous, here in the UK it will be months before I get a chance to be in line. I am 23 years old so I am at the back of the line. It is even worse for the country were I am originally from *sigh*.
0/0	I am so not taking this vaccine I am allergic to everything including sky news

1/1	I am studying health-related courses and I would like to have a positive attitude toward the vaccines.
0/0	I am suppose to get my Covid-19 shot this friday but something keeps telling me dont get the Covid-19 shot I have read alot of articles about the shot in which several people has had died because of the covid-19 shot so in all cases you have a 50 percent chance of living or a 50 percent chance of dieing this is coming directly from the CDC in which i called today to do some research for myself The CDC also has told me that this shot doesnt mean you are not going to get Covid-19 So I will skip my Covid-19 shot this Friday because i am not putting harmful chenicals in my body that is not going to stop the virus from attacking you
0/0	I am sure as Hell NOT doing it............. lol.
1/1	I am surprised how many people are willing to take their chances with COVID rather than take the vaccine.
1/1	I am surprised that people say they do not take vaccina
1/1	I am taking a vaccine next week
1/1	I am taking it.
0/0	I am the master of my own health, thankyou
1/1	I am thinking of the school start in the fall as a reasonable goal. A bummer really, but I am so excited! But my grandparents will get their second dose in the following days, so hopefully I can meet them in the summer! But to the point: every business should be able to demand vaccination for their customer. I have no sympathy at all for people that despite having no reason not to vaccinate choose not do it. It isn‚Äôt about personal choice, never has been. It‚Äôs like not wearing your seatbelt because you‚Äôre afraid of getting seatbelt bruises in an eventual crash.
1/1	I am thrilled to be vaccinated! May need to take a shot annually, as we do flu shots. That is fine. So thankful for medicine.
1/1	I am tired of lockdown, please take the vaccine, people
1/-1	I am tired of politicians playing science when they know nothing
1/-1	I am truly sorry that these brilliant people had to put in that much effort to make a video about something that has been PROVED TO BE GOOD FOR SURE 10000%
1/-1	I am vaccinated against anything and everything.
1/1	I am vaccinated and I am alive.
1/-1	I am vaccinated but I still follow -- and intend to keep following -- the guidelines erring on the side if overcaution. Part of it is that I am a high school custodian and my students are not eligible for the vaccine, plus I have elderly grandparents. It is my duty to protect the kids and old folks. Part of it is modeling good behavior for others. And part of it is that I don't want people to flip out on me and, like, demand proof of my vaccination status when they see me maskless.
0/0	I am vaccine hesitant and nothing they have said has changed my mind. I am still not getting the vaccine. I refuse until I see the long term effects and it seems like the flu shot that you have to get it yearly and I don‚Äôt get the flu shot because I always get the flu when I do and i already had Covid.
1/1	I am vaccine shy (allergic to a lot of things), just got my second covid shot & happy to say I‚Äôm still here! Wasn‚Äôt even abducted by aliens or another adverse reaction.

0/0	I am very leery of taking the vaccine I think I‚Äôll wait until we know for sure That is safe
1/1/1/1	I am very proud of our scientists, Doctors, lab techs and all of the folks that are working on these vaccines and Warp Speed. I am a front liner and am ready for them. We have the best scientists in the world. God bless them.
1/1	I am very proud to say that I was part of this Novavax during the vaccine trial as one of the unblinded nurses who gave the injections to the trial participants. So happy to hear about its outcome.
0/0	I am very reluctant to have this vaccine, but will just see what happens to everyone else, in a few months time?. my elderly neighbour had a bad reaction to the first one!.. he hasn't had the second one yet. I hope in a few months, years, everyone will he ok.. but for me it is a no at the moment.

1/0	I am willing to take a 98+% chance of surviving Covid‚Ä¶ :)
0/1	I am worried enough not to want to be at the head of the line for a new vaccine
1/1	I am yet to hear a single logical reason which convinces me that people who refuse to take the vaccine aren't complete nutjobs
0/0	I am, however, saying until a large amount of those people get the vaccine and we have seen how it impacts them, I‚Äôm not getting it. Unless in the next few months research shows that covid itself actively negatively impacts fertility, then I would consider the vaccine. But I would still want to see the research and have some kind of FDA guarantee that it‚Äôs safe for women trying to have children
1/1	I and many friends and relatives have had both Pfizer doses, no side effects.
1/1	I and many of my friends have had the vaccine with absolutely no ill affects or health related issues.... and I am allergic to penicillin. We haven't dropped dead, we haven't grown 2 heads and we haven't had blood clots coming out of our ears. Having the vaccination is the only way out of this mess.

0/0	I appreciate all you do as a nurse and you have a lovely family however I will not get the vaccine it has aborted baby cells among other things in it and several doctors have come out and said it will mess with a person‚Äôs DNA
1/1	I appreciate the idea of knowing that the people around me have been vaccinated. If people don‚Äôt care about protecting others then they can stay home.
0/0	I appreciate what you do being a part of the healthcare field . But I will not be getting a vaccine. Not now not ever !
1/1	I appreciate you, Doctor for the insightful video! Thank you for raising awareness about the vaccine and providing your professional opinion. You were thorough easing certain doubts and busting myths. Keep continuing the good job.
1/1	I arrive in beautiful Germany from Australia for work at the end of this month. I am a bit concerned for my safety. I'll try to get the vaccine before I go.
1/1/-1	I ask what is worrying them about it. Then try to gently walk through what we know about the concern & how it compares to COVID. I remind them that vax will help us reclaim what we value, protect vulnerable in our lives.
1/-1	I asked a doctor when they think this virus will end. He said how should I know, I'm a doctor not a politician.
1/1	I assume none of you got it and just use this post to feel better about not getting it. I still wear 2 masks at the hospital but getting the vaccine is a step in the right direction even if it‚Äôs only 95% effective in the laboratory. Trying to not get myocarditis.
1/1	I be having my jab soon , cant wait . Keep up the good work boris üòä‚ô•Ô∏è

1/1	I beg of people to vaccine shaming. I have spoken to numerous physicians about Astra Zeneca. They say it is as good or better than Pfizer or Moderna. All you are doing is causing vaccine hesitancy when we can ill afford it.

0/0/0/0	I believe the vaccine should me non mandatory MY BODY MY CHOICE
0/0	I believe the virus will find it's way around the vaccine then we'll be in a never ending battle with this thing.
0/1	I believe vaccines at one point were effective and safer... but since ppl realized they could profit, I no Longer believe they are safe or effective.
0/0	I bet you anything that it wasn‚Äôt the true vaccine, this is an exercise in getting you to have it. Don‚Äôt!! I sadly don‚Äôt trust them, there is an agenda, and it not about your safety, protection or health!!!
1/1	I buy churros in the NYC subway, I've bought "Nutcrackers" from strangers at Coney Island, I eat tacos from street vendors. Bring on the vaccine
1/1	I buy the AstraZeneca vaccine.
1/1/1	I calculated I was more likely to die in my car driving to get my J&J than from the vaccine itself.
1/-1	I came here to understand the vaccine and Ted Animation Explain Video is Awesome
1/1	I can even see less getting vaccinated here. It's not even that they're afraid that it's safe. A lot of it is pure apathy and ignorance.
0/0	I can feel mandatory vaccines are not okay, I can decide I don‚Äôt want one, I can think there is a possibility there will be something in them that makes it easy to track that you have gotten it AND not believe this is not the mark of the beast.
1/1/1/1	I can finally get the vaccine now
0/-1	I can get the vaccine now if I choose, but from what I've seen I'm a little scared to. Should I get it if I'm young? Do we actually know what this will do long term? Is there actual proof that it is safe? I'm nervous about it.
1/1	I can literally see that this vaccine is working , still we have to wait for at least one whole year to check whether its working or not maybe

0/0	I can live without the vaccine
1/1	I can not see the point in you refraining from vaccination with reference to any health risks
1/1	I can only dream of getting the Moderna vaccine in Croatia and it‚Äôs the one I want. Those doses are only for the rich and privileged with deep connections
1/1	I can say with the greatest confidence, vaccines do not cause autism, and that @CDCgov is in agreement. Ignore the disinformation. Remember antivaccine groups do not care about you or your family
0/-1	I can see the Autism flowing!
1/1	I can take Pfizer or Moderna if available today.
0/0	I can think of 1 thing....don't take the vaccine!
0/0	I can't believe Johnson and Johnson even have the nerve to come out with a vaccine when they had baby powder lawsuits
1/1	I can't believe it Corona vaccine is ready
1/1	I can't believe people are complaining about this vaccine.
1/1	I can't believe people are still complaining about the vaccines, people have side affects to all vaccines and medicines, it's pretty common
0/-1	I can't believe people in general are stupid or weakwilled enough to get it despite the many MANY red flags.
1/1	I can't believe we live in a world where vaccines are questioned??
0/0	I can't belive this. My son had seizures after his mmr vaccines. Could this be a coincidence?
0/-1/1	I can't even believe we are discussing such things in our country in this century. I think it will creat a two tier society, sub humans and the vaccinated ones.
0/0	I can't help but feel we're all being experimented on, socially, morally, financially, ehtically, and every other ally
1/1	I can't make myself care if people get sick after refusing to take a vaccine. At that point, it's just not my problem anymore.
0/0	I can't take a WHO and Bill gates funded vaccine.

1/1	I can't wait for this. Me and my daughter will be in line as soon as possible. I have family I have to protect. My brother has an autoimmune disorder which wont allow him to get any shots. People need to get this to protect people like him.
1/1	I can't wait to get mine! I'm pretty low on the list. But, once they open it up for the general public, I'm there!
1/1	I can't wait to get mine. Next Monday if they come in. I've heard some have to wait and make new appointments

1	I can't wait to have the Covid vaccination.
1/0	I can't wait to still have to wear a mask everywhere after I finally get vaccinated.
0/0	I can't wait until I catch covid 19 but I do refuse to take the shot.
1/1	I cannot WAIT for that data about transmission. A lot of the people I speak to who say they won't get it say it's (partially) because "it's only protecting ME. It'd be different if it protected other people." Ok sure. I'll wait. Will love to hear the next excuse after "it's not selfless enough."
0/0	I cannot have the vaccine! Frankly, I will take my chances with Covid. At least you know a little more about it

1/1	I cannot wait to take your vaccine. Thank you so much for caring about us and our health. You guys... I mean you individuals (do not want to offend anyone with the wrong pronoun) are so awesome.

1/1	I cant wait to get to vaccine so life can get back to normal
1/1	I can‚Äôt believe I just had an argument with an anti-vaxxer and their whole argument was ‚Äúdo you have any idea what they put in polio vaccines? POLIO! They‚Äôre literally infecting us!‚Äù PLEASE GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL!!!
1/1	I can‚Äôt believe the number of people who are NOT going to get the vaccine because of misinformation.
0/0	I can‚Äôt believe...after all this nonsense and lie for this last 10 months.....there is still ppl who is taking this vaccine....mad ppl
1/1	I can‚Äôt even. These people are ridiculous for so many reasons. TAKE YOUR VACCINES
0/-1	I can‚Äôt go during the day as I work

1/1	I care for my family so we will get this as soon as its available. Period.
0	I caught COVID from my sister who was showing symptoms after her second vaccine
1	I celebrate the fantastic achievement of scientists in creating this miracle the world so needs. My niece, a virologist herself, volunteered for the Pfizer trials. She did indeed get the vaccine (not placebo) and took an antibody test after which showed the highest levels of antibodies to COVID-19 ever seen at the hospital lab where the test was done! I can‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs my turn to take the vaccine!
0/0	I certainly won't be having the vaccine never never never ever
1/1/1	I challenge all anti vaxers to go to a covid ward with no protection and take a deep breath near a covid patient.
0/0	I choose not to get vaccinated because this virus isn‚Äôt a big deal to people who don‚Äôt have underlying health problems like myself.
1/1	I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic.
1/1	I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic. This Coronavirus Pandemic. Needs to be something of the past and we need to move forward with our lives. Thank you to all volunteers and participants of all clinical trials and to all doctors and nurses. Thank you for this very well instructed video regards to such a sensitive topic!
1/1/1/1	I commend these scientists working on the vaccine, they wait their whole lives for a chance like this. To put everything they learned in school and apply it to the real world, and help save alot of people.
1/1	I consider myself lucky and blessed , not only because I get to have this vaccine early but because I am still COVID free.
0/0	I could die if I take this vaccine Some people just say the vaccine helps because the creators say so and that people DON? DO RESEARCH. So no, I won? take it
0/0	I couldn't agree more. I am not taking it. I don't take vaccines at all.
0/0	I couldn't care less what the flogs say..... I'M NOT GETTING IT, END OF STORY
1/1	I couldn't even watch this, because the anti-vax comments were so typically idiotic it hurt.
0/0	I couldn‚Äôt care less about people shaming me, I‚Äôm more worried about the Government forcing it on us, let it be directly or indirectly. It seems that it will go down the path of restrictions for those who did not take the vaccine. First travel bans, then events and who knows, maybe you won‚Äôt be able to go to work or to the grocery store eventually.
1/1	I currently got the vaccine yesterday....I am still alive, and haven't grown a beard or third leg....so after what I have seen and witnessed over the last few months...didnt think twice.
0/0	I decide what goes into my body. i am the owner of my body, not the government
1/1	I decided to finally go vaccinated behind my anti-vax parent's back! :)
1/1	I definitely agree that the majority of us need to get vaccine, even if not for our own health, definitely for others'.
1/1	I definitely am! I trust the scientists
0/-1	I definitely developed bloodclots that I could FEEL after barely even a month on BC, never the fuck again. https://t.co/9JwKaSSRJc
1/1	I definitely feel safe taking this vaccine.
1/1	I definitely had to leave work the day after dose two. That was almost two months ago. Lab confirmed high levels of antibodies now 10/10
1/1	I definitely had to take the day off after round 2 of Moderna. Thats as 2 months ago. Me my staff all 4 of my grandparents have been fully vaccinated. No side effects and lab confirmed antibody immunity. Hooray science!
1/1	I definitely recommend us to take this vacine.
0	I definitely won't be vaccinated. Thank you.
0/0	I definitely won't get it
1/-1	I did a thing today. So should you.
1/1	I did it Relieved face I got my first shot (out of two) of the #vaccine I was a lil scared and had so tough anxiety, but I came out alright Blue heart and I'm glad to say I'm one step closer to being safe from #COVID19 and helping to end the #spread RoseFox faceSmiling face with 3 hearts
1/1	I did it and I am totally fine and I had cancer and a shifty Amun system and still alive then you need to stop with your bull stop spreading false information and get Educated then start talking I did not hurt the shot it self too less then a minute. But They do ask you to stay about 30 minutes So they treat you if you have a reaction but when I was there there was a bunch of people like 50 and no one got a reaction I‚Äôll be going for dose number two
1/1	I did it finally! #CovidVaccine
1/1	I did not fever after vaccination
1/1	I didn't care about people that keep telling me not to get the J&J shot because they think it's less effective. I want J&J because I don't wanna stand in line twice.
0/0	I didn't get the vaccine and I won't.
1/1	I didn't have any repercussions from the J & J shot...so happy that was my choice
1/-1	I didn't have any symptoms at the time but took a COVID PCR test anyway. The result was negative.
1/1	I didn't want to go through that again so I had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	I didn‚Äôt feel the needle go in when I got it
1/0/1	I discussed the vaccine controversy with two people at work who refuse to get vaccinated because they think their risk of contracting COVID-19 is low, the long-term effects of the vaccines are unknown and there is a chance that the vaccine could cause sudden death. I explained that the odds of being killed in a car accident were much higher than sudden death from the vaccine. Turns out that they are not good at math or science. The fact that they are putting themselves and others at risk did not sway them. I tried to go over the idea of heard immunity, but it fell on deaf ears. I am not optimistic that the US is collectively smart enough to achieve heard immunity from COVID-19
0/0	I do NOT plan on taking these EXPERIMENTAL vaccinations! Even now they have to trace you for two years after taking them because the "researchers" do not know what to expect.
0/0	I do agree with that! I won‚Äôt be giving it to my son until they do more trials on kids specifically either.
0/0	I do believe this was rushed. I‚Äôm reasonably healthy
0/0	I do not blame them for not wanting to take the COVID-19 vaccine because it is rushed way too quickly and it has not been tested very long in clinical trials.
1/1	I do not care, In will get this COVID-19 vaccine. No matter what happens!
1/1	I do not care, only I get the vaccine! There is no time to choose when there is not enough!
0/0	I do not consider vaccines for myself unless the disease is Really serious & not from an obvious nutrient deficiency.
0/0	I do not dare to take the vaccine at all
1/-1	I do not do know the exact data, but a few in a million. Do not drive if this risk level concerns you.
0/0	I do not do the mark of the beast. I'm OK without. Jesus has got my back.
0/0	I do not fear that is why I don't need to take the experiMENTAL vaccine.
0/-1	I do not need the Corona vaccine. I just need to listen to music every day to boost my immunity because it is better and better vaccination.
0/0	I do not trust science at all
0/0	I do not trust the vaccine. It takes 5 years to test vaccine. We all get different meds
0/0	I do not trust the vaccine...experts are all wrong!
0/0	I do not trust this vaccine.
0/0	I do not want a chemical (vaccine) messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you
1/1	I do not want an anti-vaxers child in my school.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I do not want that shot.
1/1	I do not want to spreading the COVID-19 virus to others
0/0	I do not want to take it.
0/0	I do not wish to take any of this. My body, my choice!
1/1	I do plan on getting the vaccine, yes. But this is based on a ‚Äúcost-benefit‚Äù analysis rather than a gut reaction like, get all vaccines!!!!! I am a very healthy, 30-year-old man. The vaccine has reportedly to have some really bad side effects for some people. Even if I get the worst of these, I will be okay because I have no other health problems.
0/0	I do pray they STAY VOLUNTARY!!! I have absolutely NO DESIRE to put that poison into my body, I don‚Äôt care who makes it! I‚Äôm not a sheep and will never be tested on....ever!!! With sooo many natural supplements that WILL prevent C19 and that are far more effective, why would anyone take this risk?!
1/1	I do some volunteer work and another guy who works there thinks taking supplements to help the immune system is better than taking a vaccine. From listening to him I know he's watching videos on You Tube. I asked one time what will he do if he has a bout with sepsis. Then he just says that we all have to die sometime and leaves it at that and this is his standard response when he has no answer.
1/1	I do take the Covid vaccine
1/1	I do think we aren't quite to the point where we have separate rules for the vaccinated. About mid may when everyone is eligible and able to get it in most of the country, I expect a new round of PR about why it's scientifically sound to come out and enjoy life after the second vaccine has taken effect. It makes me sad to see so many deeply caring people be unnecessarily afraid after they're fully vaccinated. These vaccines are the biggest scientific triumph in a generation and everyone should know exactly how great they are.
1/1	I do, millions get vaccinated
0/0	I don't believe 1 word from the who
0/0	I don't believe a damn thing the CDC says nor the company making it! I'll get the truth! The truth will prevail!!!
0/0	I don't believe a word from anyone associated with WHO/ Gates foundation!!!
0/0	I don't believe a word these people say.
0/0	I don't believe anyone. Don't want it. Too many different opinions. No ty
0/0	I don't believe in this vaccine
0	I don't believe in you & Your tests, cases, vaccines! You are all pawns of the GLOBALISTS!
0/0	I don't believe the conspiracy theories, but I don't trust the vaccines yet. First let's see how this works out. Imagine something is wrong with it; I'd rather get covid and be done with it.
0/0	I don't believe there is any future for anybody that takes your gmo vaccines...at least not any bright future...people should be smart and avoid it at any cost‚Ä¶
0/0	I don't blame them 1 bit. People are fainting after getting shots,dying and getting palsy. They won't show the numbers. I'M GOOD
0/0	I don't blame them because I will not take it anytime soon. To many unknowns, variants popping up to fast, side effects, not studied long enough.
0/0	I don't care about conspiracy or no conspiracy; I'm not taking it. That's all folks.
1/1	I don't care about political propaganda, I just want to know which vaccine is safe and easy to get. I know that Pfizer has caused 23 deaths in Norway, what about other vaccine?
1/1	I don't care how authoritarian this sounds. Vaccinations need to be mandatory.
0/0/0	I don't care what the doctors and scientists say, these vaccines aren't safe. Please, everyone, use your brain and stop listening to the media and Fauci!
0/0	I don't even get the flu vaccine. Haven't had the flu in 7 years.
0/0	I don't feel like I need it, im 27 and perfectly healthy. Old and weak people can get it first
0/0	I don't get flu vaccines so won't be getting this one.
1/1	I don't get it. A possible issue has arisen with the vaccine, the government is taking some time to run safety checks--how the bloody heck does that undermine confidence in vaccines? If the Biden administration ignored the issue and didn't check, just one single death and all the anti-vaxers would be screaming for his head for reckless endangerment. There are plenty of other vaccines sources and dosages and safety is supposed to be considered in this process.
1/1	I don't get the fear and paranoia towards the vaccines
0/0/0/0/0	I don't give a damn about going to concerts, movie theaters, etc. vs. not taking a vaccine
0/0	I don't give a frick if I get sick, it's life and I won't be taking the vaccine
0/0	I don't give a fuck what they say, I ain't getting the vaccine.
1/1	I don't have any more worries and will take it.
1/1	I don't have any side effect with covishield
0/0	I don't have the flu vaccine, why would I have this?
1/1	I don't know about all vaccines, but polio vaccine in india worked like a charm. I used to see children with polio when I was young, now i haven't seen a child with polio.
1/1	I don't know about the vaccine thing but I hope to get it just to feel better
0/0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out..
0/0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out.. not gonna take this
1/1	I don't know how we can get it through people's heads, but the arguments against getting vaccinated, such as "I'm healthy, "I'm young," "I don't have underlying conditions," and so on, are ignorant and selfish. We are at war with this virus, and until we have herd immunity, it's going to keep spreading and mutating into more lethal variants. Can you imagine that if during World War 2, a significant percentage of the draft-eligible population refused to fight? We would have lost the war. The same goes for this war against the virus. This is not the time to whine about personal freedoms and choice. We should all do our part and get vaccinated when our turn comes. Let's inject a little more personal responsibility and civic duty into the narrative.
1/1	I don't know shit about vaccines. But experts say, it is ok to get it. So wenn my turn is coming, I'm getting it.
1/1	I don't know why this is so hard to understand for them. One person being vaccinated works for that person, but it doesn't do anything in the grand scheme of things. For vaccines to work on a large scale, as many people as possible need to be vaccinated. If only one person had been vaccinated for smallpox, that would've done absolutely nothing for humanity as a whole.
1/0	I don't know why, because obviously any death is still a terrible death, but the healthcare worker deaths from covid now seems somehow worse, because they would have been so close to getting their vaccine
0/-1	I don't know. Not so many people died from flu. The virus is real. My main concern is not even about efficacy of vaccine but about side effects. Suddenly the news in MSM about deaths after vaccination have vanished. What we see is apocalyptic headlines about second waves.
0/0	I don't known if ( WHO) want to reduce the world population.with the covid vaccination program people are dying every day .
0/0	I don't like getting shots and you can't make me. End of story.
0/0	I don't like the vaccine, because it is experimental
0/0/0	I don't need a vaccine for the chinese virus
0/0	I don't need a vaccine. I'm am not in a high risk group. I have a very small chance of catching this, and a very small chance of getting really sick if I do. Protect the old and weak and let the rest of us get on with keeping the economy alive.
0/0	I don't need a vaccine. Since what you giving people is not really a vaccine.
0/0	I don't need any vaccine coz am okay since starting this pandemic coz my immune system is very strong no any virus can come to me and I believe on Jesus Christ that he will save me and even my death bcome so near then I don't wrry I will die in the name of God
0/0	I don't need gene therapy with no warranty, when the survival rate is 98% without! I will take my chances and keep God's genes in tact the way he made me!
0/0	I don't need or want the vaccine so...where does that leave me? Doomed to never travel abroad again? Coercive bullshit
0	I don't plan to get that anymore than the flu shot. I have an immune system for a reason.
0/0	I don't really trust the current vaccine, the company making them has a bad rep because their vaccines had side effect that showed up years later
1/-1	I don't see the step where the microchip is transferred by Bill gates.
0/0	I don't take flu shot I'm probably not gonna take this rushed vaccine
0/0	I don't take the vaccine.. I go for canabis lol.. Vaccine Is nothing... Those taking vaccine still die..
0/0	I don't take vaccines because I believe natural is best.
0/0	I don't think I really need a vaccine for a disease that won't kill me.
1/1	I don't think I've ever been this excited or even looked forward to geting a vaccine. Shoot me the fuck up.
1/1	I don't think most people realise quite how groundbreaking and massive mRNA vaccines will be. A silver-lining to the pandemic is the fact mRNA technology got the funding and resources it sorely needed.
0/0	I don't think the Vaccine will solve anything. People are so scared because of the media. During the war the Media were not allowed to scare people. I refuse to live in fear and take my vitamins and minerals
1/1	I don't think they should have paused the rollout. The benefit-risk ratio is still massively in favour of the vaccine. We need as many vaccine doses as we can get to reduce deaths and long-term health consequences from Covid-19.
1/1	I don't think vaccination should be mandatory for the population at-large, but for people who work with the elderly and immunocompromised? Yeah, it's only a matter of time before it's made mandatory.
1/1	I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them
0/-1	I don't trust Johnson & Johnson, last time they wanted to 'help people' we had an opioid epidemic. Edit: I'm not going debate the virus or vaccines anymore. Stupidity in people is clear, and not worth the debate.
0/0	I don't trust a vaccine when the manufacturer isn't accountable for its effects.

0/0	I don't trust these "vaccines".
0/0	I don't trust these people ,shit looks mad sketchy
0/0	I don't trust vaccines it doesn't make better..
1/1	I don't understand how no vax can exist
0/0	I don't understand how people can think that vaccines improve upon the nearly perfect systems we are born with. Being continually injected with concoctions whipped up by chemists in labs cannot be good for you. Annual flu shots, pneumonia vaccines, shingles vaccines, Gardasil vaccine against cervical cancer (that they now try to push on young males). Now covid. How many boosters will they recommend? Your body, your choice. But I don't think so. Not for me
1/1	I don't understand the anti-vaccine reasoning. This is so backward to me.
0/-1	I don't understand why places can make it mandatory when it isn't known yet if the vaccine prevents spread.
0/0	I don't vaccinate my 6 kids and their perfectly fine!
0/1/0	I don't vaccinate my kids because I don't feel safe jamming a needle in my kids arm. I'd rather have a professional do it
1/1	I don't vaccinate my kids. I believe its harmful to them and could lead to complications. I let my doctor do it, he's done it and studied how to for years.
1/-1	I don't wanna risk my kid getting arthritis or something so I'll let them die of a 15th century steamship disease instead
0/0	I don't want a chimpanzee adenovirus mRNA that was produced in aborted fetal tissue injected into me that will zip together with my genetic code. Call me selfish all you want.

0/0	I don't want that crap in my body I'm a natural herbalist I don't need poison
0/0	I don't want the vaccine
0/0	I don't want the vaccine, I don't know what's in it, its a hoax, I won't get sick, I won't die, it's unpredictable and unproven. Overhears "It makes your penis grow an inch!" WHERE DO I SIGN UP WHILE ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVE!!
0/-1	I don't want to be first in line, will wait a few months so you know more about the sideeffects

1/-1	I don't want to die, I have no choice
1/1	I don't want to get COVID!
0/0	I don't want to get vaccinated. I would prefer to take the distance measurements than losing my life after this vaccine.
0/0	I don't want to live in a world of cowards, snitches, vaccine obsessives and people who believe giving up basic human freedoms for elimination of risks is a good bargain. It's a subhuman, pathetic way to live. That's not what God made us for!
1/1	I don't want to loose my grand mother. She is the only person that cares for me! I will do it for her
0/-1	I don't want to pump man-made chemicals into my veins rushed to market : SCIENTIST: "We found giving a weak dose and then a strong dose worked better than two strong doses" REPORTER: "Why is that then ? " SCIENTIST : "Well we have no idea how that works actually.." So there's a comfort for you. Even dosing is a mystery with this liquid? Me? Polite "No thank you"
0/0	I don't want to seem like a pessimist but the vaccines that are up for authorization especially the Phizer one seems more money driven than people driven. The 95% effective solution is from 170 people out of 40,000. There is no mention of the side effects. No mention of how this vaccine will interact with other medicines. Is it safe? Can children take it? Will individuals get charged for the vaccine? I don't think there's enough time with this vaccine to know if it's effective or not. There are so many unknowns and it's only fair if these unknowns are answered. No matter how much time it takes. Agape love to anyone that read this comment.
0/0	I don't want to take the vaccine because I want to experiment with the natural stuff first that seems more promising.

0/1	I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm taking the vaccine.
1/1	I don‚Äôt believe anyone should be put through a medical procedure without their consent either. This is why I vaccinate. I don‚Äôt want to pass a deadly disease to anyone i may come in contact with and forced to be hospitalized.
0/0	I don‚Äôt believe your numbers
1/1/1/1	I don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù so long as I‚Äôm protected against COVID. If others want to reject vaccination, they can please themselves. I‚Äôll be getting vaccinated.
1/1/1	I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt take the vaccine. I have had one, waiting for the second. More for the rest of us.
1/-1	I don‚Äôt care, gimme gimme gimme!
0/0	I don‚Äôt disagree with you. I just think that we‚Äôd save more lives by not forcing vaccinations and focusing on education, community support, fostering trust and I think forcing even hospital staff to get the vaccine could jeopardize that.
0/0	I don‚Äôt even get the flu shot . No way I‚Äôd get this... I mean how much do they want to pump into people?!?!
0/0	I don‚Äôt even get the flu shot, so there‚Äôs no way I will get an experimental vaccine that I have no reason to get when the data that is out there shows that I am in the 99th percentile of surviving covid.
0	I don‚Äôt feel guilty waiting, since so many people are so eager to get it, I‚Äôll wait, no hurry, thank you. Lemme know how it goes.
0/0	I don‚Äôt feel guilty waiting, since so many people are so eager to get it, I‚Äôll wait, no hurry, thank you. Lemme know how it goes. I‚Äôve heard Bell‚Äôs palsy is possible side effect.
1/1	I don‚Äôt find this shocking at all. This should be universally accepted. There is no excuse to not get vaccinated unless you have some rare health condition which exempts you. We need to stop letting these a holes from bringing back polio or covid just because they don‚Äôt wanna get vaccinated
1/1	I don‚Äôt get flu shots never have. I will get covid vaccine since it does not require annual shots.
1	I don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs not going to hurt you to get the vaccine we all die eventually lol
1/1	I don‚Äôt give a care I just want the vaccine to come out at some point so I can have a life
0/0	I don‚Äôt give a rip who takes the vaccine...I absolutely will NOT!!

1/1	I don‚Äôt have an issue getting a booster
1/1	I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôd rather have arthritis in my hands than die from whooping cough
1/1	I don‚Äôt know also about it. But I got first dose of Covid vaccinated today. And so far I am still feeling better. We appeal you all please get vaccinated without fear. Thank you.
0/0	I don‚Äôt know for I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine
1/1	I don‚Äôt know why made in India is even important at this point...The public health concerns should override every domestic industry lobby! Providing uniform & timely access to vaccines for a country of our scale is the biggest challenge.
0/1	I don‚Äôt like medicine at all and I‚Äôm also hesitant but I‚Äôm gonna get the vaccine because it‚Äôs the right thing to do
0/0	I don‚Äôt like the two month threshold for the long term outcome effects. Doesn‚Äôt seem right.

0/0	I don‚Äôt think Ill be taking the vaccine.
1/1	I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get mine for a long time because I don‚Äôt fit any of the categories but I will definitely get it when it‚Äôs offered to me
1/1	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong yo vaccinate your own people first. It‚Äôs like if you want to help others, you gotta make sure yourself is safe first.
0/-1	I don‚Äôt think so. No to poison
0/0	I don‚Äôt think so.I follow a natural diet regimen where I eat only natural foods as found in nature, with a modest amount of high-quality proteins, supplemented with fermented vegetables and superpowder drink mixes. I live an energetic life style. I stopped taking the annual flu shots years ago and have not had the flu or even the sniffles in the last 6 years.
0/-1	I don‚Äôt think the hesitancy has anything to do with the side effects. It seems to be the quick turnaround of labeling this so-called vaccine with an over 90% success rate when it has been produced in less than a year of the first reported case of the virus
0/0	I don‚Äôt think we will even need a vaccine to end this pandemic
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust a rushed vaccine. I got all my shots even flu shots but I don‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine till at least 3 months after it comes available and I see how it goes.
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any kind of medication or vaccine that has been developed in less than a year and no trail testing? What kind of reaction to this in say 3 months 6 months, a year ? Nope I‚Äôll wait!
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any of those vaccines I‚Äôve heard of too many side effects with all of them
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any vaccine that was created in less than a year, especially at the insistence of the Trump administration. I do mask and practice social distancing and have been quarantined, even working from home. So I‚Äôm not ignorant of the disease or it‚Äôs effects. I just trust NOTHING that Trump had his hand in, knowing what a corrupt person he is.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I don‚Äôt trust drs anymore, especially those at the CDC

1/1	I don‚Äôt understand y me and my family haven‚Äôt gotten the COVID-19 vaccine when i‚Äôm always hearing about people getting the vaccine?????
1/1	I don‚Äôt understand. Why would anyone (unless advised not to by a doctor) NOT get a vaccine?
0/0	I don‚Äôt vaccinate my children because I let nature do it‚Äôs thing
0/0	I don‚Äôt wanna take a rushed vaccine that hasn‚Äôt gone through proper trials.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want any risks of the COVID vaccine making me artistic!
1/1	I don‚Äôt want anybody to die or get sick but I anticipate a tipping point where most people who have been taking this seriously are vaccinated, and the majority of new sick and dead are those who have been reckless the whole time. At least then the ones being idiotic are the ones paying the price.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want it and some my colleagues too
0/0	I don‚Äôt want it ever. However every technique in the book will be used by the government to ‚Äòcoerce‚Äô‚Äô us into taking it e.g. you can‚Äôt work, travel abroad, shop, etc. something must be done fast!
0/0	I don‚Äôt want my DNA altered, thanks
0/0/0	I don‚Äôt want my RNA rewritten or adjusted I‚Äôll pass
0/0	I don‚Äôt want the vaxx I am counting on my vitas, but, FIRST and foremost, MY GOD! We all have an expiration date, I just want to be ready to meet my LORD, without regrets.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want this thing near me. I‚Äôm hearing employers can do forced vaccinations too that would be ridiculous. I can‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs going on
1/1	I don‚Äôt want to be the one who gives it to people
1/1/1/1	I don‚Äôt want to say miracle, as seems to devalue the science, but the fact we are about to have two highly effective vaccines to choose from is amazing. I hope the scientists who developed these vaccines go down in history and are never forgotten.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want to take the Vaccine. I have the right to refuse
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I don‚Äôt want to take the Vaccine. I have the right to refuse!!!
0/0	I doubt the vaccines will stop infections and deaths now. To late, to many infected. And even if vaccine does work. China and Russia will invent another virus. The world is doomed....
1/-1	I drink diet coke so‚Ä¶shoot me up too. Stay safe everyone!
1/1	I encourage my elder parents to take the vaccine.
0/0	I ended up in the ER after my first vaccine. The symptoms slowly continued to mount up until I couldn't move and was unresponsive.I had to go by ambulance. I really don't think the ER knew how to react. After I started to come around after 12 hours and some sort of treatment, the doctor said he believes it was a reaction from the injection. Still waiting to feel back to speed
0/0	I except nothing because I am not getting the vaccine, period
0/0	I expect nothing because I am not getting it period
0/0	I fear the vaccine more than COVID
1/1	I feel a lot better now knowing we are paying top dollar for vaccines arriving long after other Nations have moved on
1/-1	I feel certain that technological artifacts have neither ethnicities nor nationalities.
1/1	I feel great and looking forward to the second dose of covid vaccine!
1/0	I feel like a karen is gunna use the risks of vaccines segment as evidence
1/1	I feel like the people that say vaccines work, but choose to not get them are even more insane than people who think vaccines don‚Äôt work at all. Even if the chances are 1/3000 or something similar, the comfort of myself is less important than the lives of the vulnerable (immuno-compromised). This goes along with masks with COVID-19. Even if there was an extremely small chance of it to prevent the spread, I would value that small chance to save a life over my comfort. I personally believe that people who go against this philosophy are morally bad people.
1/-1	I feel like the vaccine gonna slowly pick us off one by one over time so it seems normal
0/0	I feel like they‚Äôre experimenting on us. Like everyone‚Äôs waiting to see what‚Äôs going to happen in the next several months. #LabRats
1/1	I feel like this video should be on the evening news everyday to reduce fears of the vaccine and educate the public.
1/1	I feel like vaccines should become mandatory rather than optional (with doctor approved exceptions). Does anyone else agree?
1/1	I feel lucky to be in a group eligible for the vaccine before the general population. The reward greatly outshines the risk. I don‚Äôt think we have to have the vaccine to work in my state, but it‚Äôs irrelevant to me because I want it. I want the protection for myself and my family. But I believe in science. This is the most epic gift science will give the world in my lifetime.
0/0	I feel sad for anybody who gets the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ they putting the disease into u
1/1	I feel sad for people who lacks knowledge about biology lmao. They ain‚Äôt putting diseases in you (lol) they are putting weakened forms of virus and sometimes parts of the virus hull with the glycoprotein so that there will be a proper immune response to produce the antibodies for the virus. Shut up, your lack of intellect is appalling...
1/1	I feel safer knowing that I‚Äôve gotten both vaccinations. But we‚Äôre not yet out of the woods; there is a long way to go before we can expect to return to pre-pandemic life ‚Äî or some of it, at least.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I feel so bad for all the people who are being duped into taking this
1/1	I feel so blessed that our community has access to the vaccine & that with each shot given we are able to further protect ourselves and our loved ones.
1/1	I feel so fortunate. I got my 2nd vaccine yesterday Red heart So far, no reaction, not even soreness at the injection site Red heart #vaccine #grateful
1/1	I feel so grateful for all the scientists and researchers out there doing what they do. I just wish we would spend more of our society's money on research of all kinds so even more could get accomplished.
1/1	I feel so lucky to work in a district that is making vaccinations readily available to teachers and staff! Vaccine 1 done!
1/1	I feel sorry for the kids of anti vaxxers. Other than that, let the anti vaxxers themselves suffer. They're only hurting themselves
1/1	I feel very fortunate that i received my first shot last week. Its been a hard year wondering if the next patient you interact with might have Covid. A good year of wearing an N95 for 10 hours a day, pay reductions and a 6 month partial furlough. At least once a day a patient I have dealt with is positive that either wasn't wearing a mask or was not thought to have Covid (asymptomatic). It was a significant/emotional/happy moment that I know many of my fellow co-workers experienced this week when we got that first jab.
0/0	I feel very uncomfortable in the vaccine becoming mandatory.
1/1	I feel you. Very excited to get vaccinated as soon as I can. We‚Äôve survived this for a year now, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get through a few more months
1/1/1	I feel you. Very excited to get vaccinated as soon as I can. We‚Äôve survived this for a year now, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get through a few more months :)
1/1	I felt confident that doing so was the right choice, getting the vaccine.
1/1	I felt faint after my first dose yesterday. But ok after a nights sleep.
1/1	I felt flu like after my first pfizer but nothing too bad, just took a lazy day. I'm sure the second one will be worse but I'm still really fucking excited for it.
1/-1	I felt like I learned so much, and cleared up a lot of confusion. Also, the immunology animations were amazing!
1/1	I felt mildly nervous but there‚Äôs lots of conspiracy theories out there, and they‚Äôre designed to sound scary. The vaccines available are safe. I went in there, closed my eyes, and it was over in a flash. And at that point, nothing left to be done but wait.
1/1	I felt pretty rough but took it as a positive sign that my body was fighting back. I‚Äôd rather feel ill than die, or risk passing it onto someone else who dies. I‚Äôd quite like to get out and about a bit without having to worry about that.
0/1	I figure humanity has been doing vaccines for a long time already, we have a pretty good idea what works and how to make it safe. Covid killed half a million people in about a year, so I'm definitely more worried about that than a vaccine.
0/1	I finally got my first dose of the vaccine! It feels really bittersweet to be getting vaccinated‚Äîmy Mamaw got COVID & passed away right before she was supposed to get vaccinated. But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm able to help protect others.
1/1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers
1/1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers down at Redwood Education Centre
0/1	I finally received my needle today...YES!! It was eezy peezy....I'm just curious though...when does the bleeding from my ears stop...and how big is this tumor supposed to get? Oh well...im sure its just a temporary side effect...the next shot will probably cure that right up
1/1	I finally was able to schedule a covid 19 vaccination for this Thursday.
1/1	I find it funny that my mother is so concerned with the vaccine being safe, but she has had more nips, tucks, and fillers than a turkey on Thanksgiving. The bleach must be eating at her brain.
1/1	I find it horrifying that this video needs to exist. Get a vaccine. It‚Äôs not rocket science. Cry about getting a fever, but deep down realize that a fever is kinda nothing compared to dying with a ventilator down your throat
0/0	I find it interesting that Baseball Legend Hank Aaron died more than 2 weeks after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccineforme
0/0	I find it interesting that people don't give you a hard time about being skeptical about a new drug on the market, but vaccines are somehow completely safe and shouldn't even be questioned. I mean the exact same drug companies that kill hundreds of thousands with prescription drugs are also producing the holy vaccines. This is all common knowledge!
0/0/0/0	I find it odd there are no videos of anyone talking about there bad experience...true or untrue???thinking there being blocked
1/1	I find it quite sad when patients give their reasoning as to why they are not getting the vaccine, I hear it everyday. Suddenly everyone is an expert like they‚Äôve studied the virus for years. I will trust the experts who have dedicated their whole life in the field.
1/1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide.
1/1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide. But being anti-science is so hot right now. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Seems the influencing activities on social media have been a resounding success to disrupt critical systems in our country. Or is it mass-scale Dunning-Kruger effect at play? Sad times.
0/0	I find it very amusing at the fact in every picture of health care workers getting vaccinated, we do not see the actual needle nor it going in. It has been revealed on numerous occasions, with the exact same discrepancies as this example. Propaganda at its finest. all you want with those paid smiles, but you cannot deny nor hide the truth
1/1	I find that people who doubt vaccines have no historical knowledge of just how devastating disease has been to humanity throughout the centuries.
1/1	I follow a lot of doctors on Twitter they have already gotten their second dose said they had more side effects but nothing major, they said they felt like they do after a flu shot. This was from the Pfizer vaccine. Still can't wait to get mine
1/1	I for one am incredibly happy to have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine!
0/0	I for one will not be taking it. I can't trust this scam. I will wait to see what happens to everyone that took one.

1/1	I get my vaccines on schedule and whenever needed. I don't want to catch death or be spreading it.
1/1	I get round one in about 7 hours of the pfizer shot. This makes me really happy
0/0	I get that they want to calm the public and all, but the way I see it, I know what to expect if I get Corona virus: two weeks of suffering that I'll live through. What I DON'T know are the long-term effects of this rushed to market vaccine. No ty, I'll pass.
1/1	I get vaccinated not just for myself but for those who can't get vaccinated

0/0	I got covid and I know lots of people who got it. It wasn't bad. Flu is worst. Won't taking any vaccines. Good health is the best protection no vaccines can beat it.

1/1	I got mine today at the local volunteer fire department. I made an appointment online and got the shot in my car. Took about 15 minutes. Then they had you queue up in a parallel line of three cars and advanced the queue every 5 minutes. That gave a 15 minute review time and people were walking down the lines to check if you were OK. No cost at all. The shot was free and the VFD administered the shot for free. And it was J&J, so one and done.

1/1	I got my first Pfizer shot nine hours ago!
1/1	I got my first Pfizer shot on Monday. Tuesday evening I started feeling the effects. Stomach ache, headache, general blah. I feel much better now. Not looking forward to the side effects of the second shot, but definitely better than the alternative.
1	I got my first Pfizer shot today, and it is such a relief! The emotional responses I've been feeling are greater than I imagined they would be, which I suppose is a symptom of the latent stress from the past year. My second shot is already scheduled, and if you've read this far, you should get your shot, too! We're all in this together.

1/1	I got my first Pfizer vaccine yesterday. So happy to be among the first!!

1/1	I got my first dose yesterday. I'm so incredibly grateful to live in a time and place where this is possible. I recognize my privilege and I'm simultaneously saddened that others will have to wait so long for theirs. In my community, vast amounts of vaccines have been (and are being) dumped because so few people are willing to take the risk of a new vaccine.
1/1	I got my first flu shot last October. I will get the covid vaccine in the future.
1/1	I got my first jab baybayyyy !
1/1	I got my first moderna yesterday and I'm so happy I did!!!!!

1	I got my first shot 3 weeks ago. A few hours later my arm was a little sore. It lasted about a day and a half. Moderna
1/1	I got my first shot ALREADY, just a sore arm. It's too new is the reason. You understand all vaccines are new at one point right!? Don't get the polio vaccine either, have fun with THAT
1/1	I got my first shot DEC 23. Saturday my coworker tested positive, my boss test positive Tuesday and my other coworker test positive Thursday. I tested negative Wednesday! I think it works and we should push as much to have it.
1/1	I got my first shot Feb. 17th. They still had 5 doses left at the end of the day if someone wanted a walk in. By that evening my arm was good and sore but went away rapidly the next day. I even had a little bit of a sore throat, but only 24 hours, then gone. I have lots of energy and continued to feel good overall after the vax. I will continue to wear a mask, but I can't wait to eat in restaurants again. Payday Monday!
1/1	I got my first shot a week ago, and I am waiting for the second. I would advise everyone who has not, sign up for yours asap. Many states have open vaccination to all adults.
1/1	I got my first shot of anti-covid juice the other day, and I just want all the anti vaxxers out there to know: I'm fine. And I had autism BEFORE I got the vaccine.
1/1	I got my first shot of the COVID Vaccine Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes #CovidVaccine #vaccine
1/1	I got my first shot on January 3rd. I felt every side effect except for the swollen lymph nodes from day 2-6. It‚Äôs day 7 now and I‚Äôm feeling back to normal. I get my second shot on the 25th This is way better of an option than catching Covid-19

1/1	I got my first shot today (Pfizer). I am a doctor and work in long term care homes so I was higher on the priority lists where I live and work. Other than soreness in the arm, no side effects. Feeling very relieved and hopeful.
1/1	I got my first shot yesterday. I believe in science also! Thanks for being part of the solution, JR.
1/1	I got my first vaccine shot yesterday. I will get the second dose in February! So happy I got it!
1/1	I got my first vaccine today and I‚Äôm relieved!üßø As always, we will have the people who are hesitant (which is completely understandable), then we have the ranting fools who think they know it all and are constantly spewing negativity and false information. This country cannot move forward if we take 3 steps backüòí
1/1	I got my first yesterday and other than my arm being sore it was no big deal so far.
1/1	I got my fist one a week ago. Why? Because 1. I don‚Äôt want to get covid and die. 2. I don‚Äôt want to have covid and be sick. 3. I don‚Äôt want to give anyone covid and they die or be sick. 4. The more people who are vaccinated, the fewer hosts are available for it to mutate into something that the vaccine can‚Äôt protect against, of us more contagious or deadly. And 5. It protects against covid and I don‚Äôt want covid.
1	I got my fist vaccine shot yesterday. Was in and out, no problem. Only a sore arm this morning. I‚Äôm good with that. I would much rather be sick from the shot for a couple of days, than in a hospital with COVID for weeks.
1/1	I got my moderna vaccine today!
1/1	I got my my second shot 3 days ago. I've had no problems. Rock on, Doc!!!

1/1	I got my second Moderna shot last week!! I felt like total trash for a few days, and I have some pre existing issues in my nervous/immune systems. Almost a week later I feel pretty much back to normal. Please get your vaccines so we can get back to living!! ‚úåüèªüíï üòÉ
1/1	I got my second Moderna shot today. Not much of a line for the drive through and only a short wait. I just hope that means everyone is getting the vaccine and not refusing to get one.
1/1	I got my second Moderna shot yesterday. I‚Äôve never been so happy to feel like such shit. Looking forward to a booster in the fall, side effects be damned.

1/1	I got my second Pfizer Covid vaccination this morning (5 hours ago) . So far I haven't had any side effects, not even a sore arm. Now I can be part of the solution not the problem
1/1	I got my second dose Friday and am 9 weeks pregnant. Without question the best decision for me. I know it is minimal, but I do want first trimester mamas to know that pregnancy fatigue + vaccine fatigue is absolutely incapacitating for about 2 days. It is worth knowing so you can prepare.
1/1	I got my second dose four days ago in the Cayman Islands. I am 60 years old. Other than a slight discomfort on my deltoid the second day I had absolutely zero side effect from the first or second dose. Few people I spoke way around my age claimed weakness for a few days, slight headaches and obvious but tolerable pain on their shoulder after vaccination. I also spoke with a few people who were cancer survivors with no threatening side effects after vaccination. We have vaccinated over 20.000 people here in Cayman and there has not been any threatening situations whatsoever.
1/1/1	I got my second dose of the Pfizer Vaccine this past Monday, I hope this video helps others to make an informed decision to get vaccinated, stay safe everyone & lets stop the spread together.
1/1	I got my second dose today. I‚Äôm relieved

1/1	I got my very first shot of modera today. Nothing. Just a headache. But, working Two Jobs, always around the public, That's just everyday life for me. I am however, Not against people who don't want it. It took me everything I had in me to get this. I did my research, I understand the risk. I understand it's not approved, I research. It's a personal choice. People need to stop spreading lies & fearing people as well.
1/1	I got one last Thursday I had zero side effects.
0/0	I got sick with flu shot so I‚Äôm considered if I would get sick when so many have gotten sick my husband is Democrat and republican and both don‚Äôt want it it‚Äôs not about trust at all it‚Äôs the long term affects a lot of people prefer the natural way
0/-1	I got side effects from watching a bit of this. Found the cure. Bye !
0/-1	I got slight nausea and a metallic taste in my mouth for about 4 days post jab.
1/1	I got so anxious reading this thread. I‚Äôm getting the vaccination, fuck anti Vax, but fuuuuuuuck needles. I had rabies treatment as a child and I‚Äôm traumatized.
1/1	I got the #JohnsonandJohnson vaccine the first week in March and I felt rotten the first few days but there was nothing else out of the ordinary. Since I had COVID in December I haven't felt the same either, though, but that's another story altogether.
1/1	I got the 1st of the two doses so far. Grateful.
1/1	I got the COVID vaccine. I had some side effects, which included fevers, chills, muscle aches, and a headache. It went away after Tylenol. It is important to note that you should take Tylenol after the vaccine and not before, as this may interfere with the immune response. The COVID vaccine is safe and effective.
0/0	I got the Covid 19 vaccine last month and it has me feeling terribly ill and I haven't felt normal since the 5th day after the 1st shot then I got my 2nd shot last Friday it's now monday and I fear I made a mistake getting vaccinated.I vehemently advise everyone DO NOT take this vaccine!!

1/1	I got the covid vaccine and a tattoo on the same day so if people are really concerned about bad side effects just know that I am perfectly fine and I doubt you will be getting both a tat and a vaccine on the same day so it‚Äôs safe to be vaccinated!!!

1/1	I got the first dose from the pfizer vaccine, the only thing i feel is tiredness
1/0	I got the first dose of astrazenica and that evening I was not in a good way. I expected to feel a little flu-ish and had been warned as such. Mild headaches, some aching joints, maybe some mild nausea. Instead I ended up shivering so badly the bed was shaking and my back felt like someone had clubbed me with a metal pole repeatedly. Thankfully it passed once I managed to get the fever down and go to sleep. but yikes. I suppose though, knowing my body reacted that badly to a bit of protein shell, how bad might it have reacted to a real live virus? Not worth the risk thanks. I'll be having my second shot in May and hopefully it won't be as bad.
1/1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine along with my mom and I go back on March 28. The only side effect I had was a headache and a little soreness where the injection went. Otherwise I'm fine.
1/1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. My arm is a little sore but that's about it. Also, I was a little fatigued a few hours after the shot but that might be due to the fact that I'm an old man.
1/1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. My arm is a little sore but that's about it. Also, I was a little fatigued a few hours after the shot but that might be due to the fact that I'm an old man. Oh! One more thing ... the 5G microchips in it have really improved my cell reception.
1/1	I got the first dose, I have sore arm, slight fever and chills but I know the benefits outweigh the pain. I don`t know if the scientists read this but please stop torturing those poor animals in the lab by injecting them with this painful vaccin, sticking a swab in their nose to see if they have covid! I know as a human is gonna do me good but animals don`t know, for them is torture. Aren`t we humans cruel, to save our species we inflict so much pain to others :( I just want to say a big thank you to all those poor lab animals and hopefully they didn`t die in vain and this vaccine will work and they are done with testing more trials on animals.
1/1	I got the first shot of the vaccine guys !

1/1	I got the moderna vaccine and feel fine. I hope people continue to get vaccinated
1/1	I got the moderna vaccine and i have pre existing medical conditions i remember i had to wait in line for 2 hours to get vaccinated. Once I got in I tried to explain to this lady about my hormonal disorder. She didn't understand, so then i said that I also have asthma and then she said well why didn't you just say that!! So then I went to another station and they told me that I would be getting the moderna vaccine. Then after I got the vaccine they had everyone wait outside for 15 minutes in case of an allergic reaction. I went home and started feeling weird I got aches and pain a over I got a headache. Next day woke up with a headache and sweating a lot. After just pain in my arm and swelling because I have a crapy immune system. If you have a good immune system you'll be fine. My mother got it the same day as me and she felt nothing
1/1	I got the pfizer vaccine 8 days ago. Im feeling abit down but nothing else tho.
1/1	I got the pfizer!
1/1	I got the second dose two days ago. Yesterday, had to call off from work because I was so extremely tired and had a bad headache, spent most of the day sleeping. Today, woke up fresh as a daisy. Isn't that better than two weeks in isolation with Covid, or possibly having to go to the hospital?
1/1	I got the second shot of the vaccine yesterday. Surprisingly, I feel as good as, if not better than normal. Totally not what I was expecting. #allvaxxedup #strongerthanall
1/1	I got the vaccine
1/0	I got the vaccine I had a mild headache sore injection sight (mild) like someone punching you in the arm during the game "slug bug" lol I got a back ache (mild to medium depending on your pain tolerance) my girlfriend got the same symptoms we are smokers idk if that causes anything different... I feel so much safer now tho I recommend it all the residents at my group home were vaccinated today as well it was 2 weeks to late though a cook who didn't wear her mask properly every ( with chronic allergies was infected and spread it to 19/20 residents 70 and up.... 4 of which passed away in one week from covid at its worst 15 of the 20 residents went to the hospital for 2+ days or so defending. I say all this because if your scared of the vaccine do it for someone you care about and not for yourself because covid and mask if no big deal UNTIL one person doesn't follow the protocols and now u have a a wildfire spread throughout your work or family home. I was scared at to get vaccinated but I had to be the first at my job to show othersThat its safe.

1/1	I got the vaccine but I don't believe they should force people to get it.

1/1	I got the vaccine myself on the 5th of January and I feel great
1/1	I got the vaccine today and didn‚Äôt look at it. Now that I‚Äôm watching this video I can‚Äôt believe how long the needle is LOL. Good thing I didn‚Äôt look at the needle when I got my vaccine. I would‚Äôve freaked out. It honestly felt like a small pinch, no pain at all and super fast!
1/1	I got the vaccine too and shared my journey, on my yt just now!!
1/1	I got the vaccine two days ago... I'm fine. I felt like I was getting a cold for about an hour. It takes me longer to recover from a Flu shot. My arm hurt for about 24 hours. That's it....

0/-1	I got the vaccine yesterday and not even 6 hours later I was getting all of those side effects, chills, cold sweats, vomiting, migraine, fever, muscle aches it‚Äôs been absolutely terrible especially at night because I kept puking, this morning I feel more better but I still have the migraine and my muscles are still aching

0/0	I got thru 2020 without getting covid so ill be fine without the dumb vaccine
1/1	I got two already I trust them
1/1/1	I got vaccinated a few days ago, didn‚Äôt pay a dime. They told me when to come and I was in and out within 20 minutes, 15 of those minutes spent waiting to make sure no allergic reaction or weakness occurs. The shot didn‚Äôt even hurt, and I‚Äôm someone who is horrible with getting shots. Worst symptom was my arm hurt for a day or two.
1/1	I got vaccinated against corona virus

1/1	I got vaxed, so I took a vaxcation.
0/0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them .
1/1	I guess I‚Äôll be the only one in the comments to say I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my vaccine as soon as we have good evidence of safety from late stage trials.
0/-1	I guess it's called herd immunity when you're considered cattle. üêÆüêÆüêÆüêÆ
1/-1/-1	I guess there some vaccines that could increase people's intelligence
1/1	I had 2 doses of Pfizer, other than arm pain, I had NO side effects
1/1	I had 2 doses of Pfizer, other than arm pain, I had NO side effects.
1/1	I had AstraZeneca's vaccine in a trial. The side effects weren't fun after the initial dose. I felt like I had the flu for 2 days. No side effects after the second dose. That said, the side effects were a small price to pay for covid immunity.
1/1	I had COVID took the vaccine. I feel great!
1/1	I had COVID, and after a stay in the hospital I am 41 and on oxygen until my lungs heal...when and if I can get it..I will!!!! I absolutely do not want this again!!!!
0/0	I had COVID-19 last month. The side effects for the vaccine sound like they are worse than what I had with the actual virus.
1/1	I had Covid at the beginning of the year. I had my first Pfizer shot Tuesday. I can tell you now that you'd rather have the jab a thousand times over than the real thing!
1/1	I had Covid in December, and had the vaccine in January only side effect I had was my arm was achy from the jab.
1/1	I had Covid in January and it's no joke, I still have chest pain three month later... chest pains! Don't listen to the bots, get vaccinated
1/1	I had Covid in November 2020 and I received my first Pfizer dose almost a week ago. I felt fatigue, whole body muscle aches, and my arm felt like someone hit it with a baseball bat. I‚Äôd rather deal with those symptoms then Covid any day.
1/1	I had Covid in early December. Today, April 5th, I got my first Psizer vaccine.
1/1/1	I had Covid. Nothing is worse than that. Take the vaccine.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the only flu shot that I got. Even though I am in and out of hospitals all day, I‚Äôm waiting to get vaccinated until more information comes out about it.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the swine flu vaccine four years ago. We were told it was safe so i wont be taking this vaccine.
1/1	I had a dream last night that I was getting my vaccine. Too bad it was only a dream. I have to wait a lot because I am 34 . So I don‚Äôt know when I will get it .
0/0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. So, unless they are 100 percent sure, no vaccine till then!
0/0/0/0/0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. Tendentious in my right ankle. But never again for me.
0/0	I had a man come to my house yeterday to do some work, and was chatting away, then he said, " will you be having the jab?", i said no, how can you know whats in that then, he just said " well, we dont really know, do we, but yes , i'll be having it", nice bloke, and probobly in his thirties, he told me he was married and had three children, but he has accepted the narrative without question, i said he really ought to do some research into what is going into these vaccines, " oh well," he said and then moved off into another room, and i fear that is the sort of attitude of many, what a great shame.
1/1	I had a nasty experience of covid last year my self and went to get my covid vaccine and yes had a little breakdown emotionally as I stood and said thank you to the lord for showing some light and thank you to all the staff that was actually vaccinating us all one by one
1/1	I had a pretty miserable reaction to both shots - the second was definitely worse. I had fever, chills, fatigue, headache, stomach and abdominal cramping, and barely slept that night. Got the shot on a Friday, and by Sunday I was back to normal. I'd do it again even knowing how miserable it made me feel, because now I'm back to life as it was pre-covid.
0/-1	I had a professor in med school who said ‚Äú Don‚Äôt ever be the first or the last to try a medication‚Äù. I‚Äôm planning on doing exactly that.
0	I had a very bad experience with just the flu shot . Theres no way they're putting this experimental crap in me .
0/0	I had already decided not to take the vaccine long ago. I don't trust the government or the pharms. I trust God. Thank you for the article.
1/1	I had an adverse reaction as a kid and my parents were advised to not continue my vaccination plan. I had 2/3 sets of vaccinations. My reaction was honestly very minor. I had a full body rash that lasted a couple weeks. The doctors were worried about more severe allergic reactions though. That being said, I've realized as an adult that I wish they would have finished them. I have literally met people who had several family members get polio from not being vaccinated. One of the three people in their family died who got it. Yet their entire family is still stingintly anti-vaxx. I literally have to keep my self from screaming what are you doing at them? I'm not a medical professional but have a science background and the amount of disinformation boggles my mind. Did no one ever teach you to vet sources at any point in your life? Apparently not, which is a complete failure of our school system.
0/-1	I had an appointment this morning. They called and cancelled my appointment citing the FDA and CDC recommended halting the vaccine.
1/1	I had both Moderna shots. Only had a sore arm. No regrets.
1/1	I had both of my vaccines and didn't have any side effects, only with the first dose my arm was very little sore the day of, that's it! No sore arm with the second one, no side effects, my boyfriend the same as me. Yay!
1/1	I had both of the Pfizer doses and no side effects besides a sore arm where I received the injection. So grateful for science!
1/1	I had both shots already both felt exactly the same to me they were both no big deal no fever no chills, nothing. Aside from a little arm soreness. But it is based on your immune system. If you are the type of person who gets a Cold or sick from people who are sick just by being around them then you are going to have a much worse flu like symptoms to each shot More so the second one. My body is a modern marvel in that it is extremely rare that I can get sick I can sleep and live with people who are sick and I will not show even the slightest sign of it so I wasn't surprised by not having any negative side effects. My body is it's own walking bubble. Perhaps from already having gseveral diseases that My body is like a stone fortress (Graves, moyamoya, gerd.). Hence why I got early access to the vaccine because of "vulnerability".
1/1	I had both shots and only had very mild fatigue and slightly swollen lymph nodes. Nothing that slowed me down though. Much better than all the patient's I've had who were sick with covid.
1/1	I had chills and fever, aching from head to toe, extreme tiredness and headache, as well as dead arm, generally feeling Absolutely crap. Side effects lasted for 48 hours, so far. Absolutely worth it , better than covid complications any day.
0/0	I had covid and I had the vaccine. The vaccine was far worse.
1/1	I had covid and got my first dose of the vaccine yesterday. I got sick for 24 hours but am fine. This is just anti-science stupidity.
1/1	I had covid in November. I got the 1st Moderna, sore arm and joints with lots of fatigue. I'm having the 2nd next week.
0/0	I had covid last April... My body took care of it... Naturally vaccinated
0/0	I had distrust with this whole thing
1/-1	I had distrust with this whole thing when they shut down churches and gyms and schools but kept McDonald‚Äôs and Walmart‚Äôs open
1/1	I had fever for a day and headache , and in my known circle many had the same but few mostly 60 + had no side effects
1/1	I had first dose of Pfizer last month and I am absolutely fine. I didn't have any side effects. I am 60 with RRMS. I take Fingolimod
1/-1	I had first dose yesterday I get hay-fever also take meds and asthma inhaler daily After vaccine told my family Had glasses of milk and healthy food and stay in bed near radiator Side effects aching legs and light head go slow and do not do strenuous things also sat in sun in quiet and took vitamins
1	I had friends who died of AIDS, because they rejected the pharma industry. Friends who believed in alternative medicine to deal with cancer. RIP
0/0	I had it and recovered without trouble. It was a flu. Now that I'm naturally immunized, why would I take the vaccine?
1/1	I had mine about 2 weeks ago. Arm was sore for a few days. Had a headache next day & felt abit off then was fine day after that. Bring on the next 1 xx
1/1	I had mine and no effects at all!!!,
1/1	I had mine last Wednesday, I was a little achy and tired the next day ,but that passed within 24 hours and I felt my normal self , my arm a little tender for a couple of days but it‚Äôs worth it in the long term , so please if your offered the vaccine take it .
1/1	I had mine so did my family , it‚Äôs perfectly liget .
1/1	I had my 1st Astra Zeneca jab a couple of weeks ago. I felt really tired and had a heavy / foggy head for about 48 hours- I can only liken it to a hangover or jet lag. But the alternative is much worse isn‚Äôt it? I am so happy and relieved I had it.
0/0	I had my 1st shot yesterday and the side effects are killing me rn. I have a fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, chills. What‚Äôs worse is I have a scapula fracture on my right and i had the vaccine on my left.
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine and did not feel any side effects. I believe it works well with me
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine and did not feel any side effects. I believe it works well with me ‚Äòalhamdullilah‚Äô
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine shot. I just hope for the best
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine yesterday and I am 20 years old! I have chronic lung disease, asthma and I was born 13 weeks premature. The only side effect I've had is gratefulness <3 Keep safe everyone!
1/1/1	I had my covid 'jab' last Sunday morning at Ysbyty Efnys, Rainbow Hospital, Llandudno. I cannot praise highly enough the staff, volunteers, two RAF blokes on gate and the man in the parking lot for the work they were doing. So well organised, no waiting outside in the cold, all of them helpful,smiling and jolly. It was a very pleasant experience.
1	I had my first Moderna shot, they are doing people over 65 along with frontline workers nursing home residents
1/1	I had my first Oxford AstraZeneca shot over 3wks ago and I'm 52 & no complications - due in June for the second. It seems to me like they should be aspirating, just to be on the safe side, seems silly not to. Thanks for the update, you've made sense of all that, it's much clearer than I could sifting through all that data!
1/1	I had my first Pfizer last Thursday. Looking forward to my second one.
1/1	I had my first almost 4 weeks ago and I'm looking forward to my second.
1/1	I had my first covid vaccine today, one more to go
1/1	I had my first dose of a vaccine (Oxford) today and I am grateful
1/1	I had my first dose of vaccine .. Looking for 2nd dose
1/1	I had my first jab of SinoVac and it's all great, nothing to worry. However, those who don't want to get vaccinated, natural immune booster should be Vit C with zinc, Vit D(sunshine) and healthy lifestyle. Be safe and healthy y'all!
1/1	I had my first shot recently. I got sore arms the next day which lasted about half day and I was back to normal. Yet to take my second dose.
1/1	I had my second dose yesterday. I was in and out within 10 minuets. I feel like pure garbage today but I‚Äôm so happy to be vaccinated!
1/1	I had my second shot 3 days ago and so far no side effects except for a sore arm!
1/1	I had my second vaccine yesterday! Had a sore arm and feeling a bit tired today but feeling completely fine other than that
1/-1	I had my suspicions that many adults weren't smart, but I had no idea the situation was this dire.
1/1	I had my vaccine a few days ago now and I had a slight headache after and a very sore arm , but within a day back to normal ... just have the bloody vaccine and life can start to rebuild
1/0	I had my vaccine a week ago and now I am feeling morning sickness and nausea.
1/1	I had my vaccine last Thursday! I had a really sore arm on Friday easing on Saturday not even a twinge on Sunday. Rather that than lying at deaths door with Covid 19. Have your vaccination PLEASE!
1/1	I had my vaccine on Monday. I'm so grateful to get it. I've had some side effects but main one is the extreme tiredness.
1/1	I had my vax yesterday and have aall the side effects but getting over it now.
1/1	I had no symptoms after first one. Got second one yesterday. So far so good.
0/0	I had offered to me but I think I'm going to bide my time. I don't know if I want to risk the possible side effects.
1/1/1/1	I had side effects, from nausea to fever to aches. The nights were the worst. On the 4th day I slept it off. I never worried knowing my body was doing its job. I missed a day of work. I hope my 2nd shot is smoother, but if it's not, I'm still celebrating.
1/1	I had side-effects. The usual side-effects you get when the antigens in a vaccine have stimulated the body's defence mechanisms. Tired, a bit under the weather for a few hours, very mild headache, etc. Nothing to worry about; in fact the reverse; they are a sign that my body's immune response will be producing antibodies which will be lying in wait for any Covid-19 viruses which dare to try and invade. Side-effects are welcome, as was the vaccine.
1/1	I had some covid vaccine side effects that were very mild. They improved with Tylenol. I don't regret getting the vaccine, since now I am immune to COVID!
1/1/1	I had the J & J. Slept for 11 hours. That was great. I never get enough sleep...lol A little tender at injection site. That's it. Feel great
1/1	I had the Johnson and Johnson April 6th and had every reaction from 7:00PM the evening of shot to early morning, then took Tylenol with small breakfast, slept, woke up 2 to 3 hours later and fine ever since. Relaxed and saw a couple movies on Epix and drank a lot of water and took Vitamins and walked a little, made Keto dinner. Ready now for vacation, gardening in May and getting in more walks and getting my malt that I promised myself for job well done. Oh, remembered what my Mom told me: "It has to get worse before it gets better and she was right.
1/1	I had the Oxford vaccine, my arm ached for about 2 days and then for about a week after it hurt around the injection site. I carried on working as usual and didn't care much for the side effects as it means that I'm one step closer to being able to hug my grandad, which I haven't been able to do in over a year
1/0	I had the Pfizer vaccine last monday and i still feel terrible
1/1	I had the Pfizer vaccine, apart from an achy arm, I was fine ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç get vaccinated folks, when it is offered to you, take it!
1/1	I had the chinese vaccine
0/1	I had the covid vaccine yesterday and it‚Äôs knocked me out. Been in bed all day and had to call in sick at work. Think I‚Äôve had every side effect since last night
0/1	I had the first dose of the vaccine on Friday & I am fine besides a sore arm were the injection site is like the flu jab
0/1	I had the first of the Phizer covid vaccine and have suffered no ill effects. Age 69
1/1	I had the first ‚Äî and lived. I can hardly wait for the 2nd in 2 weeks.
1/1	I had the flu and pneumonia shots a couple weeks ago. 3 degree fever and major body aches for about 2 days. I've never reacted that hard before to a flu shot before. I would rather be on my ass for 2-3 days with the vaccine than two plus weeks and the possibility of needing a vent.
0/0	I had the flu vax 3 times in my life. All 3 times I got seriously ill. I'll pass on this sh!t thank you
1/1	I had the jab yesterday. See you on the other side üòÅ
1/1	I had the jhonson and Jhonson one time shot and feel better than i have in many years
0/-1	I had the same reaction to last years flu vaccine. Something triggered my central nervous system so i had tingling in my legs, arms and head. Nope. Never again.
1/1	I had the shingles vaccine. Felt like I‚Äôd been hit by a truck for a few days (achy...I have RA. Maybe that‚Äôs why?). Better than getting shingle though!!
1/1	I had the vaccine 2 weeks ago with zero side effects. Zero
0/0	I had the vaccine 3 days ago, i started to have a really strong cough recently and also i vomited 2 times, also i could not play football as i used befoe cus i kinda feel weakness, tbh i should not have had it. Its almost one week and im not feeling okay
1/0	I had the vaccine 3 days ago, i started to have a really strong cough recently and also i vomited 2 times, also i could not play football as i used befoe cus i kinda feel weakness, tbh i should not have had it. Its almost one week and im not feeling okay, sorry for my bad english, god bless you and bless all your loved ones.
1/1	I had the vaccine yesterday... IM ALIVE ü•≥
1/1	I had this shot and had no issue
1/1	I had this vaccine and I'm just recovering from being what if feels like, being hit by a bus! I told my wife and baby boy, I loved them so much...thinking the worse! But if it gives me a chance to see my boy grow have a future, it was worth the pain!
1/1	I had this vaccine in the trials. Side effects were minor.
1	I had to have this vaccine as I am allergic to penicillin do cannot have the Pfizer. Any vaccine is better than none. Maybe by the time I have my top up it will be improved but whatever I'd had I will continue to observe the basic guidelines for a long time yet.
1/1	I had two doses . Little effects in a few days. Sore arm. I am alive !!! Vaccine is safe !
1/1	I had zero side effects
1/1	I hardly can't wait to get vaccinated! Well done
1/-1	I hate anti vaccers with my whole heart
1/1	I hate anti vaxxers
0/0	I hate science and vaccine
1/1	I hate the SEC you can't just say you have the best vaccine ever but thanks for the tips. Please end this pandemic! :)
0/0	I hate to be an anti vax Karen but i don‚Äôt trust Pfizer
0/0	I hate to say it but this is starting to look like natural selection on a vast scale. Thousands of cars formed queues miles long and waited for hours to get vaccinated at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Hundreds of people tried to hand them leaflets with information about the "vaccine", it's ingredients and it's dangers. The sheep kept their car windows tightly closed. Just like little children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "Na-na-na-na". Those pamphlets could have saved their lives.
1/1/0	I hate to tell you this, but everyone being vaccinated will not make Americans normal.
1/1/1/1	I hate when people just say "research". What research? When I researched vaccines as a parent I looked at tons of peer reviewed studies and came to the conclusion that the benefits of vaccinating greatly outweighed any risks. I have trouble believing anyone could look at what I did with an open mind and come to any other conclusion. So what "research" are people who are anti-vaccine looking at? Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence!
1/1	I have 3 more weeks to go. My dad has lung cancer so I'm currently staying with them... but he goes out to restaurants and crowded places while I try my hardest not to catch covid even more than before. Being at home also drives me fucking insane so I really need this vaccine and hopefully I can at least get the fuck out of the house.
0/0	I have God, i will not put that poison in my body
1/-1	I have Tinnitus since last August as a side effect from a prescribed medicine, I'm getting better and healing.. I'd definitely like to get vaccinated but the reactions from vaccine aggrevating T keeps bothering me and that is delaying my decision to take the jab. Thanks sandhya!
1	I have a 20 something colleague who got Covid June last year. They were very fit - into martial arts and MMA. They now struggle to get upstairs without wheezing. They weren't hospitalised at the time. They felt a bit "ick" for few days (their own words "like I had a bad cold"), got "better" but some effects have still lingered. I got my second dose of (Pfizer) vaccine on Monday (30 something yo health professional). Yesterday (Tues) it was like I'd been hit by a wrecking ball - high temperature (over 38 degrees), aching everywhere, chills. Really not a fun 24 hours, and even today I still have a bit of a fever, a stiff neck, and a headache, but I'm functional. Would I trade that "feeling absolute rubbish for 48 hours but then being fine and protected" for "I'll take the chance I'll only get something mild, but it could disable me for months, if not permanently"? Not on your nelly.
1/1	I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
0/0	I have a better chance of dying from the vaccine than from Covid. Risk assessment tells me I don‚Äôt need a vaccine. Logic tells me I survived a ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù pandemic without a vaccine so I don‚Äôt need it.
0/0/0	I have a child with autism and I began to see a change im my son just hours after his MMR vaccine. This documentary holds absolute truth on this government/vaccine conspiracy
1/1	I have a compromised immune system. Hyperthyroidism, arthritis, tendonitis, and I am over weight. I got my first shot in Feb day after my b-day and my second one last month. Having an allergic reaction I do believe the CDC said it is less than 1%. To me vaccination is very important to myself and for my child. I have food allergies and a material allergy. So I had a small fear but onve I got it they monitor you for 15 minutes. Those who are monitoring are medical professionals.
1/1	I have a fear of needles and have had many over the years . This was the easiest & by far. Done & dusted so quickly.
0/0/0	I have a friend who has a child that got autistic after a vaccine.
1/1/1	I have a friend whose continuing shortness of breath, almost a year post-COVID, improved immensely after the vaccine.
0/-1	I have a fully functioning immune system which I've had all my life and has never let me down. Thank you God.
1	I have a good feeling that over the next few months we'll start to see actually good rollout. Even things like the soft power of the presidency being able to give good guidance and best practices would be helpful. Like..."oh hey guys, north Dakota did really well with this practice for rural folks"
0/0	I have a healthy young body and i do not want random fast tested vaccine in my body
1/1	I have a history of anaphylaxis. I refilled my epipens, got the vaccine, and have been totally fine since, aside from a sore arm for a day or two
1/-1	I have a lot of friends who didn't want me to get that shot. All these reasons where brought up. I didn't have the best response. Now I do.
1/1	I have a lot of respect for you doc üòá I getting my second Moderna vaccine üíâ shot tomorrow üôèüèΩ
1/1	I have a lot of respect for you doc, I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
0/0	I have a question -if vaccines work then why are the vaccinated so threatened by those who don‚Äôt want it. They will be protected ... right? I smell a bigger agenda going on.
0/0	I have a question about why you think the human body has somehow become unable to utilize its own innate defense system to combat a respiratory virus and now requires external pharmaceutical chemicals in order to stay healthy.
0/0	I have a simple question why can't they spend money on the Cure instead of the vaccine I already know the answer but I would like to know from you to answer me if is the same logical explanation of what i already know
0/0/0/0	I have a tent, i know where the woods are. Good luck making me put your toxins in me.
1/-1	I have all the basics and more, I travelled to Ethiopia a few years ago for work so had boosters
1/-1	I have all the vaccinations I'm supposed to have.
1/1	I have already gotten both shots. To anyone who is skeptical I ask what are you afraid of?
0/0	I have always been armed with th cure just incase my fam or i gets it. I dont need the jab at all.
1/1	I have always gotten a flu shot every year. I will continue to get one, so what the heck, I‚Äôll get a Covid booster, too.
1/1	I have always said I am not in a rush to get it but as it grows closer, I definitely look forward to getting it.
1/1	I have an active blood clot (developed before I got the AZ vaccine so not linked) - haemotologist advised me that most issues occurred in first 7 days after first jab. He‚Äôs happy for me to have second jab as I had no reaction to first bar mild flu like symptoms.
1/1	I have an appointment for it on 23 rd. And if they allow I‚Äôll get it
0/0	I have an autoimmune disease and will refuse to take it. I have immunity to COVID after having the Hong Kong flu in 1968. My young children were with me during the long 2 weeks my mom was there to help take care of them. I was exposed to COVID 6 times by family and a friend and did NOT get the virus My children, mom and I have never had any flu since 1968!
0/0	I have an autoimmune disorder (psoriasis) that has a high potential of becoming extremely bad if I receive the flu vaccine. And that is only a newly discovered adverse effect of THAT vaccine. I won't be rushing out for a Covid-19 vaccine because of the possibility of the same problem.
1/1/1	I have an elderly father in one country and an elderly mother-in-law in another, my wife and I have not seen them for a long time, so yeah, we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them.
0/0	I have an immune system!! It works great!! Peace!!
1/1	I have autism and I HATE it when others say 'OoOo VaCcInEs CaUsE aUtIsM oOoO'
1/0	I have autism and I was not vaccinated as a kid. Because my mum was worried about it causing autism.
1/1	I have autism myself, and no. Vaccines do NOT give autism, autism is a disorder that some people get permanently upon birth.
0/-1	I have back pain
0/0	I have bad reactions to the Flu vaccine. I haven't taken the flu shot for years. I'm not going to risk the adverse reactions of the Covid19 vaccine.
0/0	I have been a Christian for 26 years. I still won't let anyone put anything in my body, that also means the chip of the BEAST, I WILL GO TO MY DEATH.
1/1	I have been fortunate enough to get the covid vaccine.
1/1	I have been getting flu shots for the past 40 years, so ‚Äòyes‚Äô I will consider getting a vaccine for COVID 19 when it becomes available.
1/1	I have been jabbed with Astra Zeneca no problems with side effects so far.
1/1	I have been offered an appointment for a COVID vaccine tomorrow. Which obviously will mean I will lie awake tonight panicking that it won't happen and feeling bad that I'm getting it when others haven't yet
0/-1	I have been offered an appointment for the vaccine, but I feel it is too early for me to evaluate the safety. I know we are in the middle of the deep blue sea with this.. as they maybe a rick not to take. However, my of is about feeling me up to do a job that I am not dependent on and only a few hours a month! A dilemma
1/0	I have been offered the vaccine, but I don't want to take it at this time. This is new technology never before tested on humans. What can possibly go wrong? I am not an anti-vaccer either. I have taken plenty of vaccinations (except for the flu vaccine), as I love to travel to really remote areas. What do you think of Ivermectin? Thank you.
1/1	I have been pro vax my entire life and I have only had the flu once and that was when I was a 6 year old who didnt care about getting sick after that I got more serious I nearly never got sick and when I did it was just some cold that lasted a day and all I had to do was to just not touch stuff and if you want to say "well you cant say anti vax dosent work since you have always been vaccinated" I knew a person that was not vaccinated because his parents wouldn't let them get vaccinated (we were 14) and they got the flu every 2 months and had to miss about 3 days of school everytime sometimes they would get it twice in a months during flu season so obviously anti vax doesn't work TLDR; I'm pro vax and I've only gotten the flu once while an old friend has gotten it many times
0/0	I have been screaming it to everyone. The COVID vaccine is going kill people. Everything about it is hinky! How can a vaccine be produced so quickly and why do they not have a vaccine for kids?!
1/1	I have been skeptical of all medications and vaccines in the past...but in this case I will take the vaccine and be THANKFUL for it! Covid has cost us too much.
0/0	I have been told by many people that after having the vaccine they are having problems with their eyes in the light
1/1	I have been trying to get an appointment for over 65 but I get a response in northern CA out of vaccines. I hope you push to get more vaccines available. Thank you.
1/1/1/1	I have been vaccinated and the only risk for me is the pain of the needle when it's injected into me ;-;
1/1	I have been vaccinated so has my husband feel much safer!
0/-1	I have been working since this virus started and I have not gotten sick.
0/1	I have blood cancer, I need it to be 100%
1/1	I have both shots of Pfizer. All good no problems.
1/1	I have c19 I need that vaccine
0/0	I have cancer, my cancer drug already ramps my immune system up... I don't feel comfortable mixing it with the covid vaccine... I'll pass....
1/1	I have cancer. If I get Covid, I have a less than 20% chance of living. So yes, the vaccine is 100% necessary, and I will continue to wear a mask in public until we reach the 70% vaccinated mark. If you don't get vaccinated, seriously, do NOT go to your local hospital looking for help. You can help yourself NOW by getting vaccinated.
0/0	I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me
1/-1	I have children who need me.
1/-1	I have epilepsy. How would the vaccine make my epilepsy react ??
0/-1	I have faith in Jesus Christ
1/1	I have friends in DC, and I know it‚Äôs been difficult to get an appointment there. When you sign up at a pharmacy you cannot choose the vaccine you get either. But please still try to get the vaccine!
1/1	I have friends that are antivax sorta. I just say. Cool I‚Äôll wave to you from the beach, the bar or sporting event and music festival, you can stay paranoid. They change their view pretty quick
1/1	I have friends who participated in trials starting last spring, all doing fine. My husband and I just completed our Pfizer series yesterday, with no side effects. AND I will continue to mask when I'm out among those whose vaccine status is unknown because I believe in caring for my fellow humans.
1/1	I have full confidence this vaccine will work and get rid of this horrible pandemic and we can get things back to normal living seeing our family and friends again
1/1	I have got both covid - 19 vaccin. It is safe. Anyone who is eligible to get vaccinated must take the vaccine.
1/1	I have gotten mad over and over again over the past year at people who are endangering the lives of my family by not wearing masks, not social distancing, not staying home, and now refusing to get vaccinated. Too many people have died. So, so many.
0/0	I have gotten several nudges to take the vaccine and I'm flat out refusing. No thank you, give it to someone who wants to risk their health.
1/1	I have had 2 doses Covishield
1/1/-1	I have had 2 doses Covishield. My doctor colleagues has all had Covishield. My doctor relatives have had 2 doses Covishield. And about 40 or 50 million Indians have had Covishield. My colleagues tell me admissions of elderly with COVID has fallen
1/1	I have had 5 family members die from COVID-19. I don‚Äôt want to be next. The vaccine is very important to me .
1/1	I have had NO symptoms after taking both doses of the covid vaccine.
1/1	I have had Rona once already and still want to get the vaccine
0/0	I have had a severe reaction to flu shots in the past. I am allergic to nickel and Sulfa and these were ingredients in these shots which made me horribly ill for as long as 2 months and having to spend nights at the bathroom because crawling to the bathroom once took everything I had to get there. I have not taken any flu shots since the last time it caused devastating reactions for me in the late 90s. I never regretted it because I have not suffered from the flu since that horrible shot. How do I know that this shot does not contain these ingredients? I am reluctant to take the vaccine because I never fair well with secondary effects. I am allergic to opiates (such as Vicodin, morphine, and Norco), also statins, and can only tolerate a smaller dosage of lesser than 50% of Percocet without going under...as in induced into a comma I can't get out of for days. I avoid pharmaceuticals if there is a naturopathic alternative.
0/0	I have had an allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past. I‚Äôve already had COVID. I‚Äôve been told I should wait to get the vaccine. I‚Äôm very hesitant due to my allergies.
1/-1	I have had bad results from the 65 and over flu shot but the chance of getting a serious illness without it is a much greater risk! I will keep getting it!
1/1	I have had both vaccinations. After the first I felt like I had a slight hangover and a sore arm, after the second only a tender arm and nothing else. It is sooo worth getting if it means we can get back to some semblance of normality sooner rather than later.
1/1	I have had my covid19 vaccine. I have done it to protect myself , my partner and our daughter. It is worth it compared to catching covid
1/1/1/1/1	I have had my vaccine and am very grateful looking forward to the second one now. Starting to feel safer. Thankyou.
1/1	I have had my vaccine thanks. Looking forward having the second one.
1/1/1/1/1	I have had my vaccine. Thank you researchers for your ingenuity! Lifesaving work.
1/1	I have had the AZ vaccine with no problem and I am more than happy to have it again as a booster. Yes there have been issues although serious issues are minimal. Without AZ we would all still be in a lockdown with little to look forward to.
1/1	I have had the covid vaccine, I had the Oxford/astrazenecer and I have had no symptoms other than some mild aching in my legs and arms the day after I had it. I hope it is as effective as they say and fingers crossed the covid figures start to go down!
1/1/1/1	I have had the first dose. Can't wait for the second. My question for the anti vaccine brigade. Why would any government want to harm, track individual people. What is their objective you give all these horror scenarios, but WHY would every government in the world be doing this. My heartfelt love goes out to all the brilliant minds that have developed this vaccine for as I believe the GOOD for mankind.
1/1	I have had the first shot. No problems. Getting second shot 2/13. Very thankful.
1/1	I have had the first vaccine and looking forward to the second one this week. Two of my family members were hit with covid and I never want to go through the pain and suffering they went through. We need to kill this virus and I really believe that the vaccine is the only thing that will do it. To the people who are against the vaccine, I'd rather take my chance with the vaccine than taking my chance of catching the virus. We know and see what the after effects of the virus leaves you with so I will take my chance that the vaccine is had no after effects. And if it does surely it can't be any worse than the virus
1/-1	I have heard testimonies from people who have had Covid from all over the world, and it's really hard to predict how a particular person's body will react to the virus. For some, it's no more than a minor cold. They get over it in about a week, and everything is just fine. However, there are others who contract the virus, and become dangerously ill... excruciating pain, gasping for air, clinging to life on their ventilators... You get my point. Just please, please be responsible people.
1/1	I have little hope of getting the vaccine this month but maybe in March.
0/0	I have lived 30 years with multiple auto-immunity, more than one, I just feel that that the immune system is very complicated. I would not take a vaccine unless you can prove that it's 100% safe to take one for CoVid.
1/1	I have made an appointment for Sinovac vaccine
1/1	I have many friends who used to claim that they would never get the vaccine then later I found out they were first in line to get it!
1/1	I have missed gping to work so much, happy that things might return to normal
0/0	I have mixed feelings about all of the vaccines especially this one
1/1	I have my appointment Wednesday. I work in healthcare so I'm the only one in my family eligible. It will reduce the risk to all of us, but I really wish they could do it on a household basis. If my wife were to get sick, knowing I'm vaccinated I'll spiral into guilt. God forbid if she were to die what it'd do to me. Sure, I'll be healthy enough to take care of her, but there's not a whole hell of a lot you can do against a virus other than treat symptoms and I don't have a ventilation or ECMO laying around.
0/-1	I have my essential oils so I'm good.
1/-1/1	I have my first one booked tomorrow. I wonder if we can make this go the way of smallpox or if this will keep coming back like the flu does.
1/1	I have my flu vaccine every year because work pay for it and I don't get sick as often if I have it.
0/-1	I have my ice coffee in the mornings, I'm all set
0/0	I have my sea moss, elderberry, and vitamin c. No need for vaccine.
0/-1/0	I have never had a flu jab either. I haven't had flu for 12 years. I live in London. Says it all.
0/0	I have never had a flu shot! Never had the flu! Co-workers get flu shots out sick for weeks?
0/0	I have never had a vaccine and at 66 years old I m not starting now
1/0	I have never had any concerns about the safety of effectiveness of vaccines, but even if I did have legitimate concerns, I would view taking the COVID-19 vaccine as a way of protecting my loved ones from being infected by this horrible virus by me. I feel that failing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine for any reason other than legitimate medical reasons is a betrayal of their loved ones and a betrayal of our personal responsibility to keep our community safe.
1/1	I have never heard of anyone who wouldn't get Covid 19 vaccination, even anti-vaccine idiots said they would do it so they don't have to wear masks.
0/1/-1	I have never n all my life, not even n polio days, seen such HYSTERIA BY SO MANY CHICKEN LITTLES---and nearly all of the CHICK LITTLES R GULLIBLE dimwitted democrats!!!
0/0	I have never seen a vaccine can protect from any type of illness so why this fusss about vaccines? Why doctors or scientists don't get busy in investing discovering cures about existent illness like cancer, heart, liver and other internal or external body illnesses?
0/0	I have never seen a vaccine developed this quickly
0/0	I have never taken the FLU vaccines and I won't be taken any Coronavirus vaccines because I would like to die natural death. So people work with the WORLD health organisation can take all mine Coronavirus vaccines I don't want NO POISONS goinig into my my body
0/0	I have never trusted the COVID -19 vaccine since it seems sketchy.
0/0	I have news for these tyrants: I will NEVER take their RNA-destroying "vaccine" under ANY circumstances! They attempt to rape me with a needle I'll protect myself with hot high-velocity lead!
0	I have not and will not take the Covid shot and I feel great. The only time I start feeling sick at my stomach is when I see that so called expert Dr. Falsey on the news.
1/1	I have not had Covid this entire pandemic and I‚Äôm getting my vaccine in 106 hours, so freakin lucky like wow
1/0	I have not had a vaccine since the early 80s when I was in the navy . I got my first covid19 shot yesterday . I was not an anti vaxxer thinking vaccines are dangerous . I just thought I did not need them . The last true symptomatic flu experience was in the late 80s . The last 20 years I have had few experiences with colds and intestinal viruses . I figured my immune system was pretty good but being in this pandemic it may have been more about not being around sick people as I dont work in an office and dont normally go to mass gatherings . Even going out to dinner is rare . So in a way I may have mitigated contagions without making a conscious effort .doing so . Now why get the covid Vaccine ? I think the big factor is my body has no immunity to it so its a crap shoot on how it will react . I have grandkids now going back to school and playing little league which makes me more vulnerable as kids are the mosquitoes of contagion spread . I will be abit more aware of the grandkids in the future if they appear to be symptomatic with an illness and may avoid them until they are well . Just getting a cold sucks and if I can avoid that I will .Mitigation does work as they have not been sick this hole pandemic . Not even a runny nose .
1/1	I have not noticed any side effects at all, except a little sore arm.
1/1	I have not seen ANY headlines of covid vaccine creating an allergic reaction
1/1	I have noticed there is a marked increase in anti vaccine rhetoric under the guise of Christian belief. It is scary.They believe it‚Äôs a Scam,everything apparently.I really think they oppose what ever is being discussed. And they are all experts they can‚Äôt spell it,but they know!
0/0	I have one primary reason: There is no way of knowing, now, if there will be long term negative health effects caused by vaccination.
0/0	I have permanent brain damage from the MMR immunization. I used to be very, very, very supportive of vaccines.
1/0	I have plenty of health issues right now so I will probably wait until they resolve before taking the vaccine.
0/0	I have problems concentrating - Effects from other vaccines that were injected into me without my permission when I was an Infant. So I couldn't get past 35 seconds of this video
1/1	I have read a lot of article's and watched a lot of different news programs and I believe the science in the vaccines. I do believe they will help and be a big benefit to all of us. I will do the humane and responsible thing to do and get the vaccine..
0/0	I have read reports of those who have had an terrible reaction and some deaths, after receiving the vaccine. Why are these reports being heard of? Why are the seemingly being hushed?
0/0	I have read that the vaccine permanently changes DNA and cells detrimentally. It may be fine now but in a year or next infection natural immunity is impaired forever. Want to understand what is being injected before I agree.
1/-1	I have read vaccine hesitant folks tend to be moved more by personal anecdotes, something to consider.
1/1	I have received both of my Covid-19 shorts and my entire family as well! If we don't all take this dead serious it will never end, so everyone please jump on board and get yours please!
1/1	I have received both vaccines shots. No problem. A little arm soreness, but a hot shower fixed that. Not sure why people are hesitant. I was around during the polio and small pox vaccines. I remember when all the scare tactics being spread back then. Here we are today no polio and no small pox.
1/1	I have received my first dose of COVID-19 awaits second dose of COVID-19 in June
1/1	I have recieved both doses of the biontech vaccine and I'm fine. Do you want this pandemic to go on forever? Get woke people
1/1	I have run out of f**ks to give about people who do not wear masks, claim it's a conspiracy, refuse to take vaccines once proven safe, etc. It's their right to foolishly harm themselves I guess.
0/0	I have saved my children from vaccinations because of a stranger at a business seminar that has informed me of his opinion about vax, 4yrs before I had my 1st kid. There are people that listen.
0/0	I have seen more people get the virus after being vaccinated than ever before.
0/0	I have seen so much dishonesty through this pandemic why should i trust this vaccine
0/0	I have seen videos of side effects.
1/1	I have several diseases from epilepsy to autoimmune dysfunction and cannot receive vaccines due to adverse reactions in the past. But I would never force others to not get vaccines because I know that they wouldn‚Äôt have a reaction like I have.
0/0	I have severe allergies and I was hospitalized for anaflaxia. There's no way I'm risking my life with this vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I have sickle cell anemia. I'm not taking the vaccine until they do study on people like me. I'm on vitamin D3 and liquid vitamin A - zink. My diet is all organic I don't eat fast food, I cook my meals.
1/1	I have sore arm today but feeling grateful to have gotten my first dose of the vaccine. Have a happy hump day ya‚Äôll!!
1/1	I have taken all the vaccines except the mmr vaccine because of allergy and I'm thankful to every person who takes that vaccine.
1/1	I have taken both the dose of Covishield our Indian vaccine in association with Oxford I didn't get fever everything is ok till now & I m below 35 so I think the vaccine is safe
1/1	I have three more weeks until I get my second Moderna. So excited! Not for the day after, of course.
1/1	I have to agree with what has been said. Getting the COVID vaccine is beneficial not only for yourself, but for everyone around you. I believe that getting vaccinated is a way for me to do my part in combating this pandemic. I also agree with what others have said about the procedure of making the vaccine. The vaccine was expedited, as is understandable given the circumstances, but it still went through all the necessary steps that any other vaccine goes through. The number of health care workers and individuals in science fields who have received the vaccine also speaks to its reliability. If they had doubts about the vaccine they wouldn't be getting it in the first place.
1	I have to be protected. But I don‚Äôt want to take something that‚Äôs going to be useless and potentially causes me harm.
1/1/1/1	I have to say I am relieved to see how many people want the vaccine. I was worried about the anti vax population but all I‚Äôve seen so far is people begging to get it
1/1	I have to say I want take it
1/1	I have to wonder if Jenner received as much push back when he developed a small pox vaccine. This was the world's first vaccine. Now small pox is a thing of the past. Did Dr. Salk get a lot of anti vax push back for his polio vaccine? Polio is almost wiped out now.
0/0	I have under lined health conditions and I will not be having this vaccine.
0/0	I have under lined health conditions and I will not be having this vaccine. The day my family are aloud one then I may have it
1/-1	I have underlying conditions an contracting covid will kill me.
1/1	I have underlying medical issues so I will be getting the Covid-19 vaccine when it's my turn and when my doctor tell me it's time. . . I am excited to get the shot
1/-1/1	I have very little hope. I work in the construction industry and 3/4 of the guys I work with refuse to get the vaccine.
0/0	I have zero desire to take the vaccine
1/1	I have zero issue in taking a Covid19 vaccine when it's made available.
1/1	I have zero issue in taking a Covid19 vaccine when it's made available. Having nearly every top research facility working on a vaccine should show how many eyes are on the various approaches used. I do believe those researchers have the very best intentions in mind for vaccines, yet you don't know the adverse effects of something that large until years after its deployed.
0/0	I have zero plans to ever get vaccinated for covid since it does not effect me. The only reason why I know that I had covid in the first place was due to serological testing.
0/-1	I haven't changed anything with how I live since covid. I don't use a mask. I don't distance. I have felt completely fine. I'm not living in fear.
1/1	I haven't gotten a vaccine since I was a baby, probably. But I will certainly get this one
0/0/0/0	I haven't gotten the flu shot, I don't get the flu. I'm not getting this either. "But it's free." Nothing is free, everything has a price.

0/0	I haven‚Äôt had a Flu shot since 1992, when I was 7. It must just a coincidence that 28 years later I still haven‚Äôt gotten the Flu.
1	I haven‚Äôt heard about any side effects, Even if we don‚Äôt trust it [will protect us], it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to get vaccinated.‚Äù
1/1	I hear Utah hopefully doesn't have any rules around who they vaccinate (in state vs out of state). Everyone should get it
1/1	I hear you. I had a severe case of anaphylactic shock which almost killed me - but I wouldn't try to put others off having the vaccine because this reaction is rare and as a country we need to move on and get on with life.
1/1	I hear your concern about the rushed timeline, but I am a part of the Moderna trial and (very likely) received the vaccine and can say that it is safe with only minor side effects for ~12-14 hours after injections.
1/1	I heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
0/0	I heard it alters the person's DNA ??? Not in my body
1/-1	I heard it claimed the COVID vaccine didn't fall under the legal definition of a vaccine. Is there any truth to this?

1/0	I honestly wish I could have volunteered for the vaccine trials. I'm a full time mother of three, though, and couldn't take the risk. I'll be, masked, in that line with you.
1/1	I hope Pfizer can match the expected production. Would be nice to have 100 million doses per month.
1/1	I hope Pfizer reaches the expectations of people and manufacture as many as possible quickly

1/1	I hope we adopt Israel‚Äôs strategy and just vaccinate everyone who wants a shot.
1/1	I hope we‚Äòre all safe in the future.. I‚Äòm taking the vaccine.
0/1	I hope when I get my shot the 5G works well!
1/1	I hope will get vaccine covid-19 soon
1/1	I hope you all are getting vaccinated! It will save so many!!
1/-1	I hope you post this on Facebook as a video. Its the place where people make assumptions from half of the data and spread false information.
1	I hope your vaccine will be available soon for children in Hungary too!
1/1	I hugged my mama‚Äôs neck for the first time in 13 mos today. Vaccines made that possible. I‚Äôm so grateful.
1/1	I intend to do this as well ASAP. My family lives in New York and they're all vaccinated.
1	I joined the #CovidVaccine club today. Thank you Israel. Feels good, like making progress towards better times.
1/1	I joined this sub early March when we all seemed to be doomed for unforeseeable years to come. Less than a year later, and two vaccines are being submitted to the FDA. Science is amazing. We‚Äôve come a long way.
1/1	I just booked my COVID vaccine appt for tomorrow!!!! Yay!
1/1/1	I just bought my ticket to NY. I leave Greece on May 5th. I've given up getting a vaccine here, so off to The US I go.
1/1	I just cant believe how science became a sensitive topic.
1/-1	I just don't get it. Why do these anti-vaccine feel the need to stop others from getting a vaccine? If you don't want one that's fine by me.
1/1	I just don't know where to put my face after so many people using god as a foundation of anti vaccination, like can't you just shut up you embarrassing me in front of the atheist
0/0	I just don't take vaccines that I don't need. There's plenty vaccines I haven't got and I won't get a vaccine cause it's the in risk now.
0/0	I just don‚Äôt like being the very first person to try anything brand new.
0/0	I just don‚Äôt want to take a shot that was made in 9 months
1/1	I just feel bad for small percentage people who can't get the vaccine or doesn't work for them. I had a teacher who got the chicken pox vaccine but her body doesn't make the right antibody's for it. She relies on everyone else being vaccinated for her safety.
0/-1	I just find it odd that for years they don't have a vaccine for hepatitis C, diabetes, aids or for the common colds but in 12 months they got one for covid. Is it safe for all people even with serious conditions?
1/1	I just finished listening to an Interview about vaccines where @LukwesaBurak was speaking with @melindagates , who praised Nigeria's efforts to end Polio and containing Ebola. Hoping that same efforts could be used on the #CovidVaccine to end this pandemic. NaijaFisted hand
1/1	I just got JJ today at my VA It's been 10hrs and not even a sore arm... all's good !!!

1/1/1/1	I just got mine today my arm hurts right there on the spot. That means is working
1	I just got mine today. I'm still alive. If I do die though it will end my suffering so it's a win win. üòäüëç,
1/1	I just got mine today. The one dose Johnson and Johnson. I will check in on this comment and honestly update my experience. So far so good it did burn alot when they injected it but that's it.

1/1	I just got my first dose! I'm so glad to see others participating, too.
1/1	I just got my first of the two Moderna shots. No side effects other than a little soreness around the injection spot. Now, please note that I'm over 50, fat, lazy, stupid, and American. So the majority of people in the comments below should expect no more side effects than I had.
1/1	I just got my first shot of the Moderna vaccine yesterday. I feel fine, I haven't turned into a lizard and no desire to eat people.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I just got my first shot today in the Astrazenica trial. I'm willing to risk a lot to help to find a safe vaccine for everyone.

1/1/1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far.

1/1/1/1	I just got my second dose and no reaction to any dose whatsoever.
1/1	I just got my second dose of Moderna Thursday!! 8 out of 9 of my coworkers who also got the second dose (either moderna or pfizer) had fever, chills, brain fog, muscle aches, and some intense sweating that lasted 24-48 hours. All in all it's better than putting ourselves and our elderly patients at risk! If anything I feel more confident in my protection against covid because I had such an immune reaction.
1/1	I just got my second dose today!!
1/1	I just got my second dose yesterday, so that's me right now with the ibuprofen. The first one took me out for a day too, so thankfully I warned my boss ahead of time that I'd probably be taking a day off. Now I'm worried I'll be out for two.
1/1	I just got my second dose. Super happy I did , but I feel like shit. Body chills like I've never had before.
1/1	I just got my vaccine and I am very happy I had an oportunity to do it (I am a doctor radiologist).
1/1	I just got my vaccine at rite aid last night.
0/0	I just got my vaccine today and let me tell you my arm is killing me. Don‚Äôt take it people
1/1	I just got my vaccine yesterday. I want to stay safe for my mom which has diabetes.
1/-1	I just got my vaccine yesterday. My body feels so heavy especially my left arm.
1/1/1/1	I just got my vaccine! No side effects as of yet!
0/1	I just got over the china flu. I would rather have the china flu than a DNA-altering vaccine made by evil Big Pharm.
1/1	I just got some joyful news: My first COVID-19 shot is coming up soon!
1/1	I just got the 2nd dose of Pfizer and now I feel like the side effects are worse than asymptomatic COVID. Fever chills, body aches in legs arms /hands even my eyeballs hurt üòû I hope it was worth it.
1/1	I just got the J&J 3 days ago and am glad. Better odds with the vaccine than covid. And I will continue to wear a mask with a filter in it and use hand sanitizer.
1/1	I just got the J&J Saturday. No side effects so far. Barely a sore arm.
1/1	I just got the first dose of AstraZeneca
1/1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
1/1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!,
1/1/1	I just got the second shot. My arm is sore and stomach a little upset but I couldn‚Äôt be more happy.
1/1	I just got vaccinated on friday it was quick and easy no big side effects just a slight pain from the shot on your arm but it goes away in the morning. Arm pain from the shot and a bit tired but after a nap it's all GOOD
1/1	I just got vaccinated. Thank you for the informative video.
1/1	I just had a text from my dad with his vaccination dates. I'm shocked how much weight I feel has been lifted!
1/1/1/1	I just had my first dose today and have no side effects what so ever and I never felt the needle go in either
1/1	I just had my first shot Monday, second one is in a few weeks! Have been seeing a bunch of friends also getting theirs the past week or so. None of us are elderly or front line workers or anything (all roughly mid-late 30s), so seems like it‚Äôs finally getting distributed to average-risk people, at least in VA.
1/1	I just had my first shot of AstraZeneca vaccine last March 22nd.
1/1	I just had my second Pfizer Covid jab yesterday. I am a 73 year old male living in the UK. In both experiences the only thing I noted was a very slight soreness of the arm, very mild cold like symptoms, runny nose and feeling a tiny bit off colour. Otherwise great. I would recommend the jabs to anyone. In my opinion not to get them (Unless you have valid underlying health issues) is misguided. Keep well folks
0/1	I just had my second shot my teeth turned blue and hair fell out every time I turn on the microwave oven I fart the theme song to Jeopardy bark like a dog and poop my pants. Other than that I feel great I've never felt so woff ! woff ! woff ! Alive
1/1	I just had the vaccine. I feel totally fine. Don? worry too much people.
1/1	I just had the vaccine. I feel totally fine. Don‚Äôt worry too much people
1/1	I just had the vaccine. I feel totally fine. Don‚Äôt worry too much people.
0/1/-1	I just hope all the thousands who rushed right in, pushed their way in line, couldn't wait to get the double shot whammy, did not make a really big mistake and live to regret it.
1/1/1/1	I just hope that a lot of people do trust the vaccine despite it being made that fast.
0/0	I just hope this whole sorry charade stops before they start vaccinating children...
0/1	I just know there's something in there that is going to negatively affect black people.
0/0	I just learned that air we breathe and water are full of bacteria everything is so scary üò± is there a vaccine to stop me breathing and drinking?? maybe if we all wear plastic bags around our heads we won't catch a coldüò≥
0/0	I just learned you can‚Äôt sue the vaccine maker for side effects. Long term effects of mRNA vaccine is unknown. I personally know people who would rather take a conventional inactive vaccine instead of mRNA. We should change the current law.
1/1	I just ordered the Sputnik vaccine on eBay. It recommends 2 doses so I got 4 just to be sure. Only ¬£18.95 free postage
1/1/1	I just received my 2nd shot last night at Ford Field and between my 1st shot and now, I have experienced ZERO SIDE EFFECTS, not even a sore arm, "ZERO SIDE EFFECTS"
1/1	I just received my first dose (12/20) but still feel optimistic until 1/10 when I receive my second dose.
1/1	I just received my first dose of the vaccine! I hope you all are being safe and everyone can get it soon.
1/1	I just received my first dose today. So far so good. Only a minor headache few a few hours and some groggy feeling although I will say my injection site feels like I got kicked by a horse.
1/1	I just received the 2nd vacinne 2days ago. I am now very good condition.
1/1	I just received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday. The only side effect that I experienced is "soreness" plus I also noticed that I am starting to talk and act like these two dudes. That's not cool, so don't call me culo!
1/1	I just recovered from Covid and I plan to get the vaccine as soon as I am allowed to do so.
1/1	I just signed up to see if they will take me in a phase 3 trial ü§ô
0	I just took the second vaccine and I feel like I‚Äôm getting a heart attack right now
0/0	I just trust my immune system....this jab is like the ice bucket challenge
1/1	I just want a vaccine
1/1	I just want to as that if Covid vaccine is safe because other vaccines were being made for years
1/1/1	I just want to be vaccinated...
1/1	I just want to get vaccinated
1/1	I just want to get vaccinated so I can go out and meet my girlfriend
0/1	I just want to see it be used a bit more and see the effects it has before I take it.
1/1/1/1	I just want to thank you and all of the people who worked so hard to develop the Covid vaccine. I got my first dose on Friday. My only reaction was a slightly sore arm at the injection site. THANK YOU !!!
0/0	I just want to wait...I'm not against vaccines but I'm skeptical of the covid vaccines.
1/1	I just wanted to say that I have recently gotten the Covid vaccine as a 16 year old so I can protect, my family, friends, and I from Covid. I also got it because my grandpa was in the hospital not related to Covid and after he was in the hospital for a little while, he got Covid and died from it. If his nurses were vaccinated at that time or even himself, he probably would have survived and would still be alive today. That‚Äôs another reason why I got the vaccine, so no one has to go through what I went through with my grandpa.
1/1	I keep thinking how my grandmother told me about whooping cough and measles, both of which she went through as a child, and polio, which spared the family; she wouldn‚Äôt let my mom go to the pool one year because the polio had been around. I was able to get vaccinated for all of these ailments, and my generation never worried about them. But viruses are always looking for a chance, so we have another one sweeping the world with millions dead. And there‚Äôs a vaccine for it now. In many countries people would jump at a privilege being offered Americans free. They know that running the infectious disease treadmill isn‚Äôt much fun. Please get your Covid shots
1/1	I keep waking up hoping the positive energy I put out there and good karma will finally come back my way and I can get a vaccine!
1/-1	I knew my nieces had autism since they were newborns. There was something off about them. They were always crying for no reason. I told my sisters And they didnt believe me. Grew up and then diagnosed. I knew before they ever got vaccinated
0/0	I knew the vaccine wasn't ready when I heard about it the first time. Why did I know this?? Because all the other vaccines out there took years to be made while this one is made as as fast as they announce that the coronavirus is spreading. I told some people that they shouldn't get the rushed vaccine cause I was scared for their health but they brushed it off and said that I was just another Karen trying to prevent them from being safe :(
1/1	I knew this from other sources but Vox has done an awesome job with illustrations explaining it in layman's terms. It should be linked at public health websites.
0/0	I knew two people that took the vaccine and guess what? The both dead and didn't even have the virus!
1/1	I know 3 people already got J&J ,all doing well and this happened about month ago.these people who got sick or reactions they are sick from sitting home not working üòÉü§£ üè†üè†
1/1	I know 3 people now who have died after contracting covid! It‚Äôs so upsetting that people don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine! It‚Äôs not just an insult to those who have died, it‚Äôs an insult to those who have developed the vaccine and have studied these sciences for years!
1/1	I know I looked away from the needle And yes, I know I need a tan But I am so confident that the #Covid19 vaccine is safe & effective that I decided to take it myself
1/-1	I know I might die, but the vaccine is worth the risk, right?
1/1	I know a guy who was vaccinated once, next day - hit by a bus, killed instantly, coincidence? BaN VAcCinATIonS!
0/0	I know a person that become autistic after get a vaccine
1/1	I know a woman who is 95 and had both MODERNA vaccines already ,she is doing fine afterwards
0/0	I know all doctors who try to earn the people not to take these vaccines lost there licence and their videos taken down...So when you hear a doctor telling you it's safe to take the vaccine I sure would not believe them..
0/0	I know already many people who have issues with the vaccination. Much more that people who got sick by covid-19.
0/0	I know few people who died after a vaccine! This is a propoganda video!
0/0	I know how I'll end. up if I take that vaccine. exactly like the aliens in my videos. they're called J-rods and they're humans from the future. so no, thanks, I ain't taking the vaccine
0/0	I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0/0	I know its crazy and scary at the same time but it seems they are very focused on getting the mRNA into everyones body and really pushing the other 2. They are all bad but it seems there is a HIT out for this one especially.
0/0	I know my bodys immune system has a 98% chance of dealing with it, why would I want or need a vaccine?
0/0	I know of other people that have died after receiving the vaccine as well but this is not being posted on the news...When was an elderly patient that had blotches all over the body within 24 hours receiving receiving the vaccine and died three days later
1	I know of some other sites that weren't as efficient but the majority of those bugs have been worked out. So if anyone is worrying about going to a mass vaccine site, please don't hesitate.
0/0	I know one thing: I certainly don‚Äôt plan on going anywhere. I refuse to take this vaccine.
0/0	I know our technology has evolved tremendously but Nah....m
1/1	I know right........99.9% of the people who have taken the vaccines already are doing perfectly fine.......That 0.01% experiencing side effects just isn't worth the risk. Lmao.
0/0	I know several people who have had both COVID and the vaccine. Every one said they felt worse after the vaccine than they did when they had COVID.
1/1	I know some folks are against the vaccine, but some people I work with who had Covid have long-term fatigue and exhaustion. I got the vaccine. I hope you shake it shortly!
1/1	I know some people even had to call out from work because of this. Personally, having nothing to do makes me focus on the symptoms more so I would rather just go on with my days like normal.
1/1	I know that it's a long while before we know the effect of the vaccine. I was responding to my being allergic to egg, the jab did not cause an immediate reaction like other medications do.
1/1	I know that there are some black people who aren't trusting the safety of the COVID vaccine. As a black RN I encourage all African American's to get the vaccine. They aren't injecting you with COVID That's lie. If you're offered the vaccine take it and save your life!
1/1	I know that this still means wearing a mask, taking precautions, social distancing where possible, and doing my part to help our country develop herd immunity to this awful virus so I'll do it!
1/1	I know there are massive COVID vaccination deficits in the US and across the world. I hope that for all of those for whom the vaccine is available, that they choose to get vaccinated. Wear a mask, get vaccinated when you can, save a life.
1/1	I know this isn‚Äôt the kind of thing anyone else will really care about but my 82 yo parents just got their first Covid vaccinations. Crying happy tears because maybe I can see them again one day
0/0	I know two Doctors, one is a consultant surgeon, and neither of them are taking the vaccine until they know the long term side effects which will take years.
0/0	I know two people who took the Moderna vaccine 2 weeks after their 2nd dose, they got blood clots and died
1/1	I know vaccines work
0/-1/0	I know why I'm not getting an untested " vaccine"...
0/0	I know you don't want to be candid with us, but can you please at least stop the censorship? We know people who have been fully vaccinated are contracting Covid 19 and being hospitalized. Why cant you just be honest with us? The Vaccines don't work as being promoted.
1/1	I know, it's sad that a child can't get vaccinated because they have an ignorant as a parent.
1/1	I legitimately cannot wait. Pump me up. Gimme one of each for all I care. I cannot go on day to day like this any more.
0/0	I like and love my immune system. My choice. My belief. No COVID19 vaccine. Period.
1/-1	I like how all these Armchair Doctors are angry in the comments.
0/0	I like how this video supposed to make you feel like it‚Äôs no big deal get the vaccine but I‚Äôm like I didn‚Äôt want it before and now I don‚Äôt want it even more.
1/1	I like how you think 3900000 deaths is absolutely nothing....Like mate come on! Even with 0.05% chance of death 3900000 people will die and HUMANITY says even a single death is a TRAGEDY. Unless your non human, You should probably go pro vaccine. Maybe better researched ones but still Pro vaccine
0/0	I like my DNA the way it is THANK YOU
0/-1	I like that she is doing her own research and coming to her own conclusions. Following the crowd is not a choice for everyone. We all do what we believe is best for our body. That is the foundation of freedom of choice.
0/0	I like that you know the vaccine is poison!
0	I like the 4th one, I won't be bloody taking anything, who's gonna make money out of this
0/0	I like these odds. I refuse to be part of a massive test of unknown side affects of rushed vaccine. I will take my chances with my own immune system. My body, my choice.
1/1/1/1	I like this presentation. Thanks for sharing this. I got my first Moderna vaccine about 10 days ago. I experienced a sore arm and a minor rash. Looking forward to getting my second one.
1/1	I like this, except please take whichever vaccine is available. They are all good, not just the mRNA ones.
1/-1	I like to think about it this way: If you have serious reaction from the vaccine, imagine what it was like getting the real disease... If you have small to none side effects, then great!
0/0	I literally cannot see any benefit in getting the vaccine. But I do see a whole lot of risks . They still can‚Äôt prove that it gives you ANY kind of immunity. They might as well be injecting you with water.
1/1	I literally despise needles with my whole entire body and soul, but you know imma be the first to get that vaccine
1/1	I literally had a dream the other night that I got the vaccine. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the entire dream. And it was great.
0/0	I literally would never put anything in my body that has the branding, ‚ÄòWarp Speed.‚Äô I would not drive a car branded ‚ÄòAssembled in 48 hours.‚Äô I wouldn‚Äôt hire an accountant branded ‚ÄòBorn yesterday.‚Äô
0/0	I live healthy and avoid commercialized medicine!
1/1	I live in Arizona. I got vaccinated yesterday morning. Very slight sore arm/not a big deal at all. I did get feverish for just a few minutes two or three times yesterday. Took ibuprofen before bed and slept great last night and feel 100% today. Still very slight soreness in my arm.
0/0	I live in Florida & the vaccine rollout has been absolute shit.
0/0/0/0	I live in Florida and if someone is walking up to my door and ready to stab me with a needle, this is a stand your ground state they better be wearing bulletproof vest
1/1	I live in India and I am visiting the US right now - getting my vaccine in Indiana tomorrow morning. I didn‚Äôt come here specifically for it but I‚Äôm super glad to be getting it as India is months behind.
1/1	I live in NYC and got my second Moderna shot yesterday. I feel like dog shit, the aches and pains are no joke, but I'm so relieved that my immunocompromised fiancee is safer now that the people around her are vaccinated.
1/1	I live in a 4 gen. household & I‚Äôm w/students in person so I jumped on the #COVID19Vaccine as soon as I could. Getting vaccinated means I can better protect my family and school community from the daily risks we‚Äôre all living with.
1/1	I live in urban and accept the COVID-19 vaccination.
0/0	I look forward to being part of a proud elite group of unvacinated in years to come. We shall look down with contempt on the mass herd of sheep who allowed themselves to be cowed and bullied into submission. We shall be the new upper class.
1/1	I look forward to receiving my second shot in about a week and then enjoying the freedoms that those of us with vax passports will have, that the unvaccinated won't. Sucks for them
1/1	I look forward to seeing american covid cases plummet once we are all vaccinated.
0/1	I lost so much respect for you. Mass vaccination is not necessary for a virus with a 0.02% IFR. Let those who want/need it take it and leave the rest of us alone!
1/1	I love GMOS and Vaccines
0/0/0	I love all the people who just can't wait to be the latest guinea pig for big pharma. Will sure be interesting to see the long-term side effects from these drugs. No thank you. I'll do a hard pass on this one
1/1	I love how for 6 months peopla have been begging for a vaccine to be made and when one comes out they say it's "sus" and refuse to take it
1/1	I love how people will say don't take the vaccine because "I don't want to be 1 in a million." Then go on to defend that with "99% don't die from covid" yeah because 1 in 100-700 are much better odds.... dumb till the end.
0/0/0/0	I love how the intention of this video totally flipped on him. Just made me more sure not to vac.
0/0	I love how there‚Äôs an entire marketing campaign to ‚Äúother‚Äù people just for being skeptical and erring on the side of caution with their HEALTH. Ironic.
1/-1	I love how they keep mentioning "the risks of vaccine side effects" just to keep the anti-vax people watching.
0/0	I love how they narrate it like they're talking to a fucking child. Piss off and take yr vaccine with you.
0/0	I love how they say we need to get vaccines INTO people ...
1/-1	I love how you guys worded the title to attract anti-vaxxers
0/0	I love my job and yes I‚Äôm quitting if they require a covid shot
1/1	I love pfizer I will always love,an amazing company working day and night to serve humanity
1/1	I love seeing all of you get vaccinated! But don't post your vaccination cards on social media! Posting your vaccination card on social media could lead to a scam or even identify theft.
1/1	I love seeing more and more posts of folks getting their first shot. Gives the rest of us hope that we will be able to get one too. Thank you for taking care of us!!
0/0	I love the Trumps but an this vaccine stuff was a bad idea...i get why it was rushed out to push the lockdowns out but I have a bad feeling its gonna backfire long term
1/1	I love the benefit of them.
1/-1	I love the line "do some research". Firstly, if I'm debating with you, I likely have a basic idea what I'm talking about, it's silly to automatically assume you just know more than people on a subject. Secondly, you know who's probably done the most research? The actual experts. The scientists, the researchers...and they tend to overwhelmingly say the same thing.
1/1	I love this so much. Let's get that vaxxed rate up!!!!! Just drive around and shoot people with the COVID-19 vaccine ü§£
1/1	I love to get vaccinated. Makes me feel powerful.
1/1	I love you.....you have giving me and my loved ones a new lease on life thank you to you and all your colleagues.....Pfizer Rocks...!!
0/0	I love your show and family but I will not get the vaccine. No long term effects done. Scientists don't even know if it's one and done, yearly boosters needed, nothing. Look what thalidomide did to babies in the 60's.
0/0	I made apt for Pfizer vaccine and CANCELLED IT! Why ? I walked in to work a coworkers best friend died right after their second dose !!! I said hell no !
1/1	I made my appointment in advance waiting for high risk health issues to be eligible in my state and have been so eager to get it and protect myself
0/0	I may be furry and fat but I‚Äôm not your jab lab rat!
1/1	I mean 2.97M is a lot of dead people. I can't imagine how many more would've died if we never shut down and created restrictions. And even if you don't die, having Covid isn't very fun so you should probably get a vaccine anyway.
1/1	I mean I've tried to sign up for almost every trial, so you could say I'm a bit impatient.
1	I mean if you want covid that‚Äôs cool.
1/-1	I mean is there anyone who is not sceptical about this vaccine? I will definetly get the vaccine but I would rather wait a few weeks before it gets public.
1/1/1/1	I mean it's the same with any vaccine so I'll take it right away
1/1/1	I mean talking about side effects just look at the ones for paracetamol which is effectively used in most of the world as far as I know
1/1/1	I mean, I'm certainly going to want the vaccine, I just might want to be part of the second batch, just to be sure it's safe.
1/1	I mean, good? Better than the bin - the more people vaccinated, the better for everyone.
0/0	I mean, the Aluminium3+ ion is used in vaccines. Though, several studies has shown it to have direct connection to alzheimers, diabetes athritis and so many more chronic diseases. Look it up.
1/1	I mean... I've had several shots and all my vaccines. and I'm still alive and healthy and living my best life..
1/1/1	I met an anti-vac kid who was also living the diet life of organic, gluten-free, etc all per the parent... kid looked sick as hell.... HOW IS THIS NOT CHILD NEGLECT?!?!?!
1/1	I met several health care workers in a CoViD_19 hospital, who refused vaccination ,citing reason that( Covishield) vaccine contains RNA! Neither RNA nor non- RNA vaccines are harmful .The eradication of Smallpox and Polio happened due to vaccines .
0/-1	I might consider it ten years from now
1/1/0/1	I might take the vaccine after maybe a year to see how people react. I just don't understand the vaccine panic and people sitting in lines for hours waiting for it which may put them at greater risk. If people relax and wait till it's all widely available things will go more smoothly.
0/0	I might trust the long term studies when they come out in a decade or so.
1/1	I missed my life,get me the vaccine as fast as possible
0/0	I more scared about the vaccine then about the virus
1/1/1/1	I must admit that I don‚Äôt believe anything the media says anymore. Despite that, I hope the vaccines work.
1/1	I must say, most of the replies to this are uplifting. Being one of the early cases, left with severe respiratory damage from it, I hope this effort prevents a lot of people from having to suffer what I have.
1/1	I myself received Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine recently. The only side effect was a sore arm. Everyone with access to a COVID-19 vaccine should take it. And the world should help Africa secure a steady supply, where virus mortality rates have shown a concerning rise.
0/0	I need additional information about the vaccine.
1/1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one
1/1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one, I'm old and at high risk.
0/0	I need more Info. For now, I'll social distance, eat well, exercise etc. Then 6 months from now see some results such as Is the vaccine more harmful than the virus or If the vaccine wipes out Covid-19

0/0/0	I need no vaccine I'm healthy enough.
1/1	I need that now. Guinea pig on deck !!
1/1	I need to get this vaccine so that I can safely take a trip somewhere because every day I feel like I am closer to losing it
1/1	I need to get vaccine, so that I can get entry approval for Singapore. Please help me with this. I have been married for 1 year and unable to meet my husband, as my entry approval is rejected each time. Vaccine can help my chances for approval. Please help!
1/1	I need vaccine for Corona virus
1/1	I need you to get the covid vaccine
1/1	I need you to get the covid vaccine.
1/1	I needed to watch this video... I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it. I think I just needed someone to tell me that I am overthinking it and she definitely got my head straight
1/1	I never considered not having the vaccine. In fact, I was looking forward to having it, I wanted to have it done. I‚Äôm anxious to get back to normal life as soon as possible.
0/1	I never even thought about hesitating! My husband and I knew it was the right thing to do for us! We have gotten both!
0/0	I never get a flu shot, why would I get one for this?
0/0	I never get the flu shot and I never get the flu. It pays to have a strong immune system and good genes. üí™üí™üí™
0/0	I never get the flu shot and I‚Äôm not getting the COVID shot
0/0	I never get vaccine never will I don't trust it
0	I never get vaccines. I've done a lot of research. For me, I have found the vaccine risk outweigh the disease risk.
0/0	I never got sick. Why would I even think about taking a vaccine?
1/1	I never had any side affects from eigther one of my covid shots it was Pfizer is this good or bad that I never had any side affects I might had a sore arm from the 2nd one
0/0	I never heard a single report about blood clotting from Covid-19 before these medicines were given. Now we're expected to believe the manufacturer that the virus can do it and not the medicine. Riiight...
0/0	I never took the flu shot I'm sure not taking this vaccine
0/0	I not taking vaccines during COVID-19
1/-1	I noticed that most of the people that are against this cannot spell or use proper grammar.
1/-1	I once almost chocked on food. Food nearly killed me. Therefore, I chose not to feed myself or my kids. Some may say that eating food supposedly ‚Äúprevents starvation‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to ignore the risk. Choking. Bad taste. Food allergies. And so many other risks, that are so much worse than not eating food. If you choose to feed your kids potentially deadly food, that‚Äôs on you. But based on my 2 minutes of internet research, I will protect my kids, and not feed them. Anti vaxxers in a nutshell
0/-1	I one is going to freely accept something that is being jammed down their throat against their will.
0/0	I only came here to see a GIGANTIC amount of thumbs down!
0/0/0/0/0/0	I only fear being forced to do something I dont want to do. I eat healthy and I exercise regularly that's my vaccine. Thank you and leave me alone.
0/0	I only have 2 words for this play: PURE EVIL!
1/1	I only trust pfizer.
0/0	I only, trust my body, my heart,and gut! Always!
0/0	I opted out of it at work. I went back to work the day after my residences got theirs , I was not a pretty sight. A lot of them were in a lot of pain, had really bad head aches, just didn't feel well .
1/1	I overheard a conversation at Barry island today between two elderly people, commenting how brilliant their experience at West quay medical was at the Saturday vaccination clinic...." So efficient....straight in and out we were".
0/0	I passed on the vaccine would rather take my chances on my natural immune system given to me by God.
0/0	I person i know died 6 days after getting the second does of a massive heart attack.He was 83 .Glad iam not taking it right now!
1/1	I personally believe it‚Äôs my duty to get vaccinated to keep patients and my colleagues safe.
1/1	I personally chose to get the vaccine because this virus has killed younger people in great health like myself and I really don't want to take that risk or worry every time I go to the store about catching it.
0/0	I personally do not understand why anyone would get it but I‚Äôm not going to shit on people for getting it. Pro-covid vaccine people on the other hand will attempt to socially shame you into compliance.
0/0	I personally do not understand why anyone would get it but I‚Äôm not going to shit on people for getting it. Pro-covid vaccine people on the other hand will attempt to socially shame you into compliance. Want to get it? Go for it, it‚Äôs your choice. Leave me the fuck alone though.
0/-1	I personally do not want either of the shots however if it becomes necessary to work or travel I will get it. My choice. I had Covid already thoough.
1/-1	I personally don't expect COVID-19 to go away, I think it will just become the new seasonal flu for which you have to get vaccinated anually.
1/1	I personally haven‚Äôt had any bad side effects of getting vaccines, so I don‚Äôt have any idea on the bad side of vaccines. I‚Äôm not saying that vaccines are 100% safe. I‚Äôm just saying that getting a vaccine is better than getting a deadly disease
0/0	I personally know two people so far with crippling side affects from the vaccine after taking the second shot. I don't know which vaccine either of them had but both are now having to use a walker to get around. The vaccine wasn't tested long enough.
1/1	I personally want to give a huge shout out to all the scientists, lab tech's and health care workers that have made this happen in less than a year.
0/0	I personally will not get the COVID vaccine
0/0	I personally will wait to get the vaccine. I don‚Äôt see why it should be mandatory, as in theory, if other people have the vaccine, they should be safe from me, no? They will have immunity from the virus, and so it can be a person choice for my body wether or not I am willing to risk getting the virus.
0/0	I personally won't get it right now. Its too new and I want to see how it goes before I decide, I think that's reasonable
1/1/1/1	I personally would be happy to have the vaccine.
0/0	I placed my trust in God not scientist
1/1	I plan on it to protect myself from the ill people the income in contact with and hope to return to traveling internationally.
1/1/1/1	I pray Father God that all the vaccines will work and everyone will get their 2nd dose on time

0/0	I prefer not to take the vaccine.
0/0	I prefer risk taking it than vaccine myself
0/0	I prefer to wait for at least a year to see to affect of the covid vaccine!
1/1	I probably won't be eligible for months, but I will when it's my turn. I'm a little nervous about potential rare side effects because I already have two chronic illnesses, but I've heard enough horrific real things about post-COVID syndrome to overcome my imaginary worries.
0/-1	I question vaccinating all medical personnel without knowing long term effect.,
0/0	I quit listening to the regular radio, because of all lies that are being spread about the bs vaccines
0/-1	I ran a test because I didnt believe the disease was real. No fever. No symptoms. Nothing. I'm fine. I took a 40 minute jog in Miami. I don't believe it's a real disease.
0/0	I rather die on my feet than live on my knees by taking this vaccine
0/0/0/-1	I rather die on my feet than live on my knees!!
0/0	I rather die on my feet than take the vaccine and be paralyzed with the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0	I rather die than giving my body to those so called wise people

0/0	I rather have Covid19 than get a Vaccine shot.
1/1	I rather have a small shot than having to stay quarantined another year
0/0	I rather have covid-19 then take the vaccine.
0/0	I rather have the guillotine on my neck than having this supposed vaccine!
0/0	I rather inject shit into my body than have this vaccine. I have a strong feeling that this vaccine will become mandatory and if you refuse, your human rights will be stripped. You won't be able to travel, go to a restaurant, go to the cinema, or even enter a hospital. I fear for 2021. Things will be much worse.
0/0	I rather keep wearing a mask and staying clean then take that vaccine
1/1	I rather take a researched vaccine than risk the sideeffects of a random virus
0/0	I rather to make my own vaccine than taking the J&J's
1/1	I reacted strongly to my Covid vaccination, aching all over, very tired, just for one day. May have been because I had had Covid recently. No problem. Worth having if it helps to end lockdown!!
0/0	I reacted to one Vaccine now I won‚Äôt vaccinate again.
1/1	I read all these anti-vax comments and I think to myself: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
0/-1	I read somewhere that it‚Äôs only effective for 180 days max, is that true?
0/0/-1	I read that alot of Drs and nurses don't want to take it... and they are on the front lines.
1/0	I read that as "Covid vaccines are slowly spreading the virus" and almost started to cry.
1/1	I read that the Pfizer vaccine's clinical trial had over 43k participants, which is ten-fold of the average participants in a clinical trial like this. Which should absolutely speak for the safety of it.
0/-1	I really afraid about side effects of vaccine Damn those fu¬¢king Chinese
1/1	I really agree that healthy nutrition and vitamin C and D have their contribution to make but not in any way enough to get us out of this terrible mess. The vaccination programme is the only way.
1/1	I really don't get anti-vaxes I trust a trained doctor more than a small article on the internet
1/-1	I really don't get the people who are like "Who'd pay $1000 for a vaccine?" We are all paying vastly more than that for the lockdown? Obviously? I can only model this as "neurotypical doesn't money", which I worry is not a very empathetic or predictive model.
0/0	I really don't understand because people will still put on masks and social distance. I don't think if it Will help us
0/0	I really dont trust these people enough to get something like this from them if they are pushing this and making it free and it messes with your DNA in some way you got to be dumb if you take this.
1/1	I really dont understand anti-vaxxers. Vaccines saved so many lives & are proven to be safe, especially under such strict standarts we have nowadays.
0/0	I really don‚Äôt understand how the vaccine would be if any benefit for the very frail. I‚Äôve worked with hospice patients for 10 years and I didn‚Äôt even recommend the flu vaccine.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I really happy that vaccine will be made from COVID-19 i hope it come out soon because i really wanna for people‚Äôs life‚Äôs be saved from covid
1/1	I really hope this vaccine keeps all from catching this terrible virus
1/0	I really think that people should stop scare postings over the Vaccines...its frightening enough the whole situation without speculating and causing more angst
1/1	I really want the mRNA vaccines, although I'll take what I get. These sorts of vaccines from everything I've heard are revolutionary and may be the stepping stone to eliminating all sorts of ailments. NOVA had a show which talked about them very recently, and it's encouraging to say the least. Can we imagine a world where the flu is eliminated? Where, maybe, some cancers can be prevented? It's a brave new frontier for medicine, and I am hoping in our lifetimes we can see these vile diseases curtailed.
1/0/1	I really want to receive the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	I really want to think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the vaccine, I just can‚Äôt get there
1/1	I really wish my mom would vaccinate me; I'm okay for now, but I'm worried I'll get really sick one day.
0/0	I received 1shot & 2 shout of Moderna. No reaction from #1. #2 was a very bad reaction. Very dizzy, walking like a drunk, lasted 4+ weeks. I still have bad days after 6 weeks.
1/1	I received 2 injections 28 days apart. I chose to volunteer and participate in the Moderna Clinical trial because I want to help get the vaccine out so we can go back to our lives.
1/1	I received Moderna, my son and Mom who is 80 both had the 2 shots of Pfizer, no problems, I get my 2nd shot Thursday
0/0	I received an email from a doctor that there were many poisons in these vaccines
1/1/1	I received my 1st Moderna dose 2 days ago. The shot itself was very typical, similar to the flu or pneumonia. Not painful at all. But it is a needle in the muscle, so obviously my arm was sore that night & the next day, but by today has subsided to a minimal ache. I suggest getting it in your dominant arm, relaxing your body & exhaling right before injection & moving the arm around after. As for side effects? About 2 hours later, I became very sleepy & napped for 2-3 hrs. It made my body feel tired as well, but not in an unpleasant, sick fatigue way, but rather, the feeling your body gets after an intense workout or how you feel after taking a bunch of cold meds. Like tingly jello muscles. Don't be afraid. In total honesty, I felt worse after my flu & pneumonia vaccines. This one was much more tolerable. I know everyone is different but bottom line, if you can handle a flu shot, you can handle this.
1/1	I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday (2/11) and the decision to get the vaccine was a no brainer. A great deal of the hesitation or concern that some people have about getting the vaccine is due to a lack of understanding and/or bad information spreading through the net.
1/1	I received my 2nd dose this week. I‚Äôm so thankful and looking forward ahead.
1/0	I received my COVID 19 vaccine I have gotten 3 different types of cancer but otherwise feeling fine
1/1	I received my J&J vaccination over a month ago. No issues. Just a little soreness in the arm for 2 days (lifting weights the next day). Same with multiple people who I know. Here we go again with the fearmongering.
1	I received my Pfizer #1 yesterday and I saw hundreds of happy people including myself. The clinic was run smoothly and professionally. Great job to the gang at Mid-Hudson Regional Hospital !!
1/1	I received my covid vaccine today! They are braving the cold & it went smoother than a chic-fil-a drive through. I‚Äôm so grateful to put covid behind me!
1/1	I received my first COVID-19 vaccine today. #COVID19 #WVStrong #MaskUpWV
1/1/1/1	I received my first Moderna vaccine yesterday. 19 hours later, I'm happy to report no problems.
1/1	I received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago. NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy. The injection site in my arm began to hurt about 6 hours after I had the shot. The pain was manageable without ibuprofen or aspirin. By the second day the pain began to fade and late in the afternoon it just disappeared. I worked out today and feel fine. From what I've read the second shot probably won't go as easily. However, at 70 years old I figure the reward far outweighs the risk.
1/1	I received my first dose and I'm a mother of a disabled, medically complex child. We have to do everything we can to protect our kids from this virus!
1/1	I received my first dose of the #CovidVaccine 24 hours ago @uihealthcare. It was a happy day, a triumph of science. It was also a sad day as hundreds of thousands of people around the globe are still getting infected every day.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine this afternoon. So far so good, zero side effects.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Pfizer about an hour ago and so far so good.
1/1	I received my first if two COVID-19 vaccines today. I was incredibly impressed with the efficient operation. Great job Howard County Health Dept!
1/1	I received my first one already (healthcare). Can't wait to get the second and be doing my part to get out of this mess. Yes, new vaccines are scary. The unpredictability of COVID and this crazy world we are living in seem even scarier to me.
1/1	I received my first shot about 3 weeks ago and will be going for the second soon. I had a mild reaction from the first one I got a headache and felt extreme fatigue the symptoms cleared up in 24 hours..my boss had both dose she did not react from the first one at all but the second one she had a reaction.. she had extreme fatigue, headache, joint pan, but in about 24 hours symptoms cleared up.. I would rather deal with the symptoms from the vaccine then the symptoms from the virus.. stay safe everyone..√∞≈∏‚Ñ¢¬è
1/1	I received my first shot of Moderna about 2 weeks ago. Had a stiffness in my arm for about 3-4 days and on the 5th day I felt absolutely no side effects.

1/1	I received my shingles shot in November and had the same side affects as he described, had the 2nd shot 2 months later and the same miserable side affects twice. but it was worth it not to get shingles. most vaccines have reactions .
1/1	I received my vaccine today. I would simply like to thank you for this channel and it's fact and evidence based content during this past year. It has been a wonderfully insightful place to turn to and I am sure contributed to my mental well being. thank you.

1/1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far
1/1/1/1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
1/1	I received the Pfizer vaccine today. I work at a post office and at least 10 of my customers are no longer alive due to Covid-19. One death is too many. One case is too many. I love my neighbors and customers as myself and will do all I can to protect them and keep them safe.
1/1	I received the Pfizer vaccine today. Thank you for your helpful info!
1/1	I received the first dose of the vaccine and thanks to this video I now have a better understanding of why and how the vaccine works.
1	I received the first vaccination of the Moderna vaccine this morning and I had heat flashes and sweating after 10 minutes but it went away really fast and I was back to normal.
1/1	I received the vaccine and didn't have any of these issues. Its ridiculous that these problems are even coming up for people.
1/1	I received the vaccine and no problems here thankfully.
1/1	I recieved a phone call from my GPs practice on the 6th Jan informing me that I was to receive my vaccination on the 8th Jan. Brilliant so efficient the practice was so well laid out with Marshall to assist one to enter and a well distanced area to wait the 15min after the vaccination. Great service by fantastic caring people. Thank you NHS
1/1	I recieved my first dose of the pfizer yesterday. Has anyone experienced back pain afterwards?
1/1	I recieved the vaccine 1st dose this past friday and I feel absolutely fine my arm was a lil sore.
1/1	I recieved the vaccine moderna. As a nurse who works with the elderly at the VA, I dont want to pass anything on to them. I am also a brittle diabetic & It didn't effect my blood sugar levels (that was suprising). I was not feeling well for a few days, Exactly the way my body responds to the flu shot. The injection didn't even hurt.
1/1	I reckon the vaccine is safer than those pills people were/are popping in Ibiza though. Doesn't stop them popping them though. ;-)
0/0	I recommend everybody here to put this in a search engine: "america's frontline doctors position paper on covid-19 experimental vaccins" They will tell you why you should not take this vaccin. Click on the link to get the PDF.
0/0	I recommend never take vaccine.
1/-1	I recommend the Oxford jab personally. As acedemics here will live and die by that method. The issue being Security services are rife within that sector. As in Oxford is mi5 and mi6 recruitment and training territory. Other than that, I would look at evidence and make your own choice. The Pfizer vaccine is filthy trash, stay away.
1	I recommend you make a video especially about the corona vaccine because you have a wide audience that trusts and believes in you and it can help us all
0/0	I refuse it. They want to kill us. #NoToVaccine

1/1	I remember going to get the polio vaccine when I was a kid. My ex husband had polio. He got it when he was 5 years old. He spent 1 year in an iron lung. His age, just missed getting vaccinated. Forever changed his life. Vaccinations can save lives. Plus, help keep the economy improving.
0/0	I remember having to get the chicken pox vaccine in the 10th grade. The next year I was out of school for a month with the chicken pox. I'm not in a hurry to get the covid vaccine.
1/1	I remember my science teacher used to wear a shirt that said: Got Polio? Me neither. Thanks science!

1/1	I remember when I had to travel to Asia -- I was grateful to be vaccinated against these insidious diseases.
1/1	I request every individual to take vaccine and cooperate with our Government measures and follow it properly so that we all can defeat this kind of virus easily.We have to think about the front line workers as well and pray for everyone guiding and protecting us

1/1	I said No Way at first but after doing some reading and listening to experts in the medical and science community I decided to get the vaccine. I get my first shot tomorrow! I‚Äôm ready!
0/0	I said it when they first started telling folks to get these vaccine that I could see the writing on the wall. ‚ÄúIf you have taken this vaccines you may be entitled to compensation‚ÄùRemember folks, NONE, I repeat, none of them are approved by the FDA.
0/0	I said this months ago whoever puts that stuff into you the day get them to countersign it because nobody will be held accountable if things go wrong
0/1	I saw a post where a pregnant healthcare worker got the vaccine, then about a week-ish later posted that she had miscarried. It could've just been a horrible coincidence, because she was still kind of early in the pregnancy, but pregnant or nursing women aren't supposed to get the vaccine yet.
0/0	I say be patient and allow sufficient time to research the hell out of Covid-19 vaccines because the long term side effects are still unknown. I am not even hopeful that science will ever beat a coronavirus
0/0	I say be patient and allow sufficient time to research the hell out of Covid-19 vaccines because the long term side effects are still unknown. I am not even hopeful that science will ever beat a coronavirus. Sars-Cov2 seems to be exposing the arrogance within the scientific community.
0/0	I say no. If they can't answer questions about it, no, we should not take it.
0/0	I say: ‚Äúmy body, my choice‚Äù
1/1	I see a lot of angry people in the comments and I get it, vaccine hesitancy is a real problem. I just think that a good way to combat that is by being transparent, and cautious. Personally while it's a tiny amount of people, I think it's a good thing to investigate
1/1	I see from your bio that you are a runner. Are you happy on taking the chance to 'survive' but never run again because you lungs are shot to bits as a consequence of long COVID? The vaccine also reduces severity of COVID among those who do not develope full immunity.
1/1	I see how you can be nervous, but you need to trust it. We have passed mass human trials, it is safe.
0/1	I see myself as being at little risk of getting a case of COVID-19.
1/0	I see people saying covid vaccine is different but not giving any reasoning other than the rare vague statement that it is untested. What is the actual argument? You can't change someone's mind with vagueries
1/1	I see so many people dismissing this virus, and that makes me sad - thank you to these amazing scientists. Covid is really quite horrific and I don‚Äôt even know what kind of internal damage has been done to me. One thing is for sure - I‚Äôd gladly have the vaccine right now if I could because my biggest immediate fear is getting this virus again.
0/0	I see that ethics and morals is no longer applicable in medicine, it's become corrupt with profit.
1/1	I see too many anti-vax things from friends, so as a concerned mom every now and then I need to rewatch this video to remind myself to ignore them. I love this video!
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I see vaccines like seatbelts. If you're in a serious car accident and are wearing a seatbelt it isnt 100% guaranteed you're going to survive. But you have a higher chance of surviving by wearing a seatbelt then those who choose not to wear a seatbelt and get into a car accident.
0/0/0/0/0	I see why people don't want to get the vaccine, they simply don't trust the people saying it's safe.
0/0	I seem to be triggering a lot of people by saying that the COViD vaccines are ‚Äúuntested‚Äù... Another truth that is hurting...
0/0	I seen a guys mother get convulsions and siesures after taking the Pfhizer shot. It was very disturbing.
0/0	I sent my 77 year old father to the hospital by ambulance last night 3 days after getting the first dose of the pfizer vaccine. His left arm was sore he was hallucinating seeing and talking to people that were not there had the chills dizziness vomiting. This is why you dont rush vaccines!
1/-1	I seriously hope it gets to the point where you can‚Äôt do certain things, like fly, unless you show proof of vaccination.
1	I seriously want my vaccine. I'm 47. Can all older people go and get there now so we younger people can have appointments soon ?!
0/0	I shall not be rushing off to have any of these novel mRNA vaccines which have no proven efficacy or beneficial health outcomes since there is no clear evidence in the medical literature. Instead I am having my immune status measured by a private appointment with a Consultant in immunology and respiratory disease. So far I have not had Flu or Covid-19 and I am 90!
0/1	I should hope all the negative commentators are not anti maskers!!! We are about to enter our ( third )lock down here in Ontario, can? get enough vaccines
1/1	I shoulda got the vaccine when I had the chance. I was being too skeptical
1/1	I signed up to be put on the list I‚Äôm Nervous but it took a a lot for me to do this I‚Äôm proud of myself
1/1	I signed up to be put on the list I‚ÄômNervous but it took a a lot for me to do this I‚Äôm proud of myself
0/0/0	I simply do not trust the government what so ever. The government doesn‚Äôt care about us.
0/0	I simply think the potential side effects are to high and I‚Äôm more then happy to take my chance with my 99.95% chance of recovery.
0/0	I sincerely don't see anything positive about the vaccine been said to be administered all over America, I'm definitely not going to take it because I've not heard a single positive feedback from ANYONE that has been vaccinated...it's either they grow worse or develop another kind of worse sickness.
1/1	I spent the last year stuck at home because a very specific group of people refused to wear masks or take any precautions. Now you want me to let their unvaccinated selves hang out wherever I am at? No. We need to stop catering to this crowd and asking everyone else to put up with them just to go anywhere. Get vaccinated or stay home.
0/0	I stand with all of you and my Godly family everywhere.
0/0	I state that the Corona Virus & Covid-19 illness is severely dangerous because at the moment there is no medicine for this illness and no Vaccine for vaccination of people and when Vaccine made it takes years to complete vaccination of all nations
1/1	I still believe in science
1/0	I still don't know about taking it. My family is just gonna wait and see if there's side effects.
1/1	I still don‚Äôt get Anti-Vaccine people, I wonder what‚Äôs making them scared when the doctors literally said it‚Äôs safe..https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=youtube&uilel=3&passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26app%3Ddesktop%26hl%3Dde%26next%3D%252Fwatch%253Fv%253DSSuxVwMkcpA&hl=de
0/0	I still don‚Äôt know if I wanna get the vaccine because what if the government wants people to die and he does not wanna tell us.What does the government wants us to take the vaccine so that more people can get sick and die
1/1	I still got mumps as an adult even with vaccinations but it was pretty minor. Even if they aren't 100% effective they give your immune system a chance to fight back if you do catch it.
0/0	I still know not one person that died of corona !! No shot fr me ! Also had corona and it was merely a small cold fr me.
0/0	I still mistrust the COVID-19 vaccines
0/0	I still retain the right to control what goes in my body. You may be confident that these corporations and government have your best interest in mind, I'm not.
0/0	I still scare,I only vac.ones for the flu.I don't want too.
0/0	I still think we have been overthrown and are watching mass murder in slow motion (aka genocide)....
0/0	I still want to see a fact-check from a leftist side on Biden's claims
0	I still wouldn't take the Oxford vaccine.
1	I stopped when they started interrupting people. Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1/1	I strongly believe in the science behind vaccines, and I‚Äôm amazed at how quickly we developed highly effective and safe options for the pandemic coronavirus. I also have long experience in advising parents and using vaccines. But I don‚Äôt believe you can force people to get themselves or their children vaccinated.
1/1	I suffer bad anxiety and panic with anything medical. I‚Äôm stressing over not feeling well after having it done but it‚Äôs our duty to do it to save lives. I want an end to all this death. Pleading face
0/0	I suggest all sheep take it
1/0	I suggest that this vaccine be given to the politicians and bankers first.
0/0	I suggest you look up the history of recalled drugs for your country and the EU. Even in normal times, drugs make it through the testing process that turn out to be dangerous. So the idea of not wanting to take a vaccine that is being rushed and under-tested isn't "not trusting science". It's wanting the full science to be applied to the drug.
1/1	I suppose 550,000 deaths and counting don‚Äôt matter to those who refuse to get vaccinated. It‚Äôs always the next guy that pays the price until you find yourself on a ventilator wishing you had been more aware of the danger. It‚Äôs mind boggling selfish and just plain stupid
0/0	I sure as heck am NOT taking that thing
1/-1	I sure do trust the World Health Organization - they wouldn't lie or withhold information about anything
0/0	I sure hope it helps you and doesn't cause any harm to you. Its been rushed and god knows what it is capable of. May you be and stay healthy. Nature needs you
0/0	I sure wouldn't want to be one of the first...
1/1	I suspect that the general population trust a scientifically tested vaccine far more than Konspiracy Karen on the comments section.
0/0	I swear last year it was ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù boy have things changed. I DON'T WANT IT
1/1	I take a daily multi vitamin, Omega 3 fish oil, etc... I am pretty healthy as well. However, when I am able to schedule my appointment on the 31st I will plan to get the vaccine ASAP. This virus has gone on for long enough at this point.
1/1	I take a flu shot every year. Instead of autism, I only get minor pain for like 2 hours.
1/1	I take my vaccine asap
1/0/1/1/0	I take the vaccine , after that i have all the symptoms of covid
1/1	I take the vaccine , after that i will feel great.
0/0	I take vitamins
1/1	I take what I get, satisfied because then I have done my duty
1/1	I take what I get. If it works, it works ...
0/0	I teach my body to resist viruses by eating healthy and building my immune system I don't put any messenger in my body
1/1	I thank all of those who volunteered for the RECOMMENDED 3 - 7 year trials. God bless and Good luck!!
1/1	I thank countries that are making it possible for everyone to get vaccinated. Together we shall win the battle against
1/1	I thank you and your scientists a million times.
1/-1	I think 70% of the population should take the Covid vaccine. Would y‚Äôall let me know when you‚Äôre finished?
0/0	I think Big Pharma is insisting on vaccines to give cover for massive nuclear contamination. Vaccines CAUSE almost the same symptoms that exposure to radioactive contamination, only often more immediately apparent (nuke exposure takes 4-7 generations to show up the worst effects).
1/1	I think I heard something about Moderna thinking about combining the Flu vaccine with the Covid vaccine. I take the Flu shot every year so I think that would be great. Anything to keep everyone safe.
0/0	I think I will pass on the vaxx and take my chances.
0/-1	I think I will still take my chances and wait a while
1/1	I think I will, this entire lockdown I‚Äôve been fighting to keep my mental health in check and almost lost myself, if getting this vaccine returns life to normal I‚Äôm willing to take a chance, but I‚Äôm going to wait my turn and let others try and see the effects of the vaccine and continue to take precautions such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and predominantly staying home.
0/0/0/0	I think I'll wait about 15 years before trying this out
0/-1	I think I‚Äôll get the vaccine so when I become really crippled from more toxins, I can tell everyone Mick Jagger made me do it.
0/0	I think I‚Äôll just stay home, thanks.
0/1	I think I‚Äôll pass on the Covid vaccine.
0/0	I think I‚Äôll take my chances with my own immune system thanks! If I happen to get it (as a working nurse through it all, still hasn‚Äôt happened) than I‚Äôd feel safer going with treatments than an experimental vaccine
0/-1	I think I‚Äôll wait for a few more guinea pigs to try it out. Maybe next year.
0/0	I think a mandatory vaccine order would be the end of civilization. I am sure sandnigger know it, too. I don't think it'll happen, but if it does, buckle in.
1/1	I think an anti-vaccine parents should be responsible (charged) if their child dies from a preventable illness.
1/-1/1	I think anti-vax people are just not doing any scientific research
1/1	I think for the vast majority the Covid vaccine is indeed relatively safe. There is a small portion of the population who will have an adverse reaction to it. The question for me isn't whether or not it's safe, it's which risk am I more willing to take...
1/1	I think having those side effects (if they exist) is better than being dead
0/0	I think if the Big Pharma companies would accept liability in the event of adverse side-effects, or death, people might not be as hesitant. I think the main reason though, is it hasn't been fully tested and officially approved for use. Emergency use authorization isn't going to cut it for people on the fence.
1/1	I think if there is a vaccine made... it should be illegal NOT to get it, if you are able to get vaccinated.( I‚Äôm not talking about people who are allergic and who can not get it for medical reasons) by willingly refusing to get it , you are actively killing people and you should be thrown in jail.
1/1	I think it is important and I am not throwing my shot away!
1/1	I think it should be law to have it
1/1	I think it shows the FDA panel is taking the approval process and the scientific merits of the data seriously at least! which is good IMO
0/0	I think it speaks for itself these vaccine companies are protected from making things right if they kill/hurt people... Just saying.
0/0	I think it was rushed through very early, very quickly. So I would like a little more data
0/0	I think it's already too late late people can't open their eyes and see the truth. And I won't take that back scene I have never had a flu shot and I do just fine.
0/0	I think it's more dangerous to get the vaccine than take my chances getting Covid.
0/0	I think it's more dangerous to get the vaccine than take my chances getting Covid. If Biden becomes President, he'll force us all to get it against our will.
1/1	I think it's vital to get the vaccination out to the Refugee camps around the world. They have to suffer horrid conditions as it is, this just makes things worse for them. I just Pray that our Lord Jesus Christ keeps them safe
0/0/0/-1	I think its all a sick sick lie and the damn mark of the beast in n a way people change this is u zee
1/1	I think it‚Äôs fantastic for our health department due to the fact that back in March, they predicted there wouldn‚Äôt be a vaccine until next April. And here we are at the end of the year with a vaccine that just got shipped to my state. Fantastic job!
1/1	I think it‚Äôs funny that people won‚Äôt get the vaccine because ‚Äúwho knows what‚Äôs in it‚Äù but will eat American cheese, hot dogs, and drink cows milk etc. But hey, do you. I‚Äôll still wear a mask to help protect you even though I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Byeee
0/0	I think it‚Äôs reasonable to be skeptical about anything you put into your body, including vaccines
0/-1	I think one of the real reasons countries and people everywhere in the world don't want the covid-19 vaccination is because covid-19 isn't seen anywhere in public. It's only on the news and people are noticing that.
1/0	I think people forget or unaware of what vaccines do: they trigger an immune response. Side-effects are expected.
1/1	I think people should keep in mind that Covid 19 itself can cause sometimes fatal blood clots.
0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated
0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated, fact
0/0/0/0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated, fact .
1/1	I think that if the current mRNA vaccines hold up and work as well as they're supposed to and there are no long term effects they are the future for many things. The ability to plug and play is very cool.
1/1	I think that risk goes up considerably if you actually have a clotting disorder, but if you don't, the risk is pretty much zero. My husband had a stroke caused by a clot when he was 36, so he is going to steer clear of the AZ and go for an mRNA one instead. It's great that we have options!
0/0	I think that we should wait, atleast three years, to see the results, in the long term, of the vaccine.
1/1	I think that when being vaccinated becomes compulsory in order to return to some sort of normalcy - to go on holiday or watch live sport. Many people‚Äôs scepticism will melt away as quickly as it appeared. Preferring instead to get on with their lives!
1/1	I think the J & J vaccine is the perfect vaccine for those that are younger and healthier.
0/0	I think the global panic has lead to a vaccine being rushed and 5 months of testing is, in my totally uneducated opinion, not long enough to prove there won't be any adverse effects down the line.
1/1	I think the legitimacy of the vaccine is very promising.
1/1/1	I think the majority of anti-vaxxers are just uneducated. People rely too much on social media to obtain information when you should be doing actual research. I understood why Erika didn‚Äôt want to get the vaccine due to allergic reactions, but then she went on to say she doesn‚Äôt want to wear a mask and she‚Äôs healthy because she‚Äôs vegan. So that just lets me know this isn‚Äôt about your allergic reactions this is just you being ignorant. I like how the medical professionals agreed that you don‚Äôt have to get the vaccine if you don‚Äôt want to but at least practice social distancing and wearing your masks.
1/-1	I think the pollsters asked the wrong ten people. The British grew out of being lambs to the slaughter after WW1.
0/0	I think the scientific method of experimentation is overlooked on test and analysis.
1/1	I think the vaccine is ok. I like the speaker.
1/1	I think the vaccine is our best chance to end the pandemic.
0/0	I think the vaccine is too rushed and it's a competition between several countries in the world. I don't think I need one. The COVID19 isn't more dangerous than the flu for young people like me.
1/1/-1	I think there will be a ton of people who will refuse to get the vaccine unfortunately
0/1	I think there's a huge amount of cowardice embedded in the anti-vaxxer movement. Fear of a scary needle and some temporary symptoms disguised in bullshit conspiracy theories.
0/-1	I think these comments are absolutely fantastic! it's gives me peace in my heart to know that people from all over the world are AWAKE!! iv researched this for years (among everything else) and it's felt like a lonely & frustrating place sometimes! But to now see how many people know their agenda is refreshing! ALL YOU NEED IS YOUR OWN IMMUNITY!! WE DO NOT CONSENT!!
1/1	I think these companies should share the recipe for the vaccine with other companies/governments so we can produce it as fast as we can. Keep developing new ones but get the ones we got out to other people. Stay healthy everyone!
1/-1	I think this is ok. Why because it's truth.
0/0	I think unicef you are the one who created this virus, good people say no to this vaccine, trust GOD ONLY.
1/1	I think vaccines are good because if I get that virus then my body already knows how to fight it.
0/0/0	I think vaccines are hokus pokus!
1/1	I think we are now playing Russian roulette with Covid. The various new & more dangerous strains are finding their way into Australia & winter is approaching, but we think there is time to fool around being picky with lightning strike odds against various vacations options?
0/0	I think we can all agree that giving up our bodily autonomy to heartless corporations and elected officials is a bad idea
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I think we can all agree that giving up our bodily autonomy to heartless corporations and elected officials is a bad idea.
1/1	I think we overestimate the amount of anti vaxxers. I think itsjust that they're the vocal minority so sometimes especially online it can appear that everyone is an anti vaxxer even though it isn't true
1	I think you should be grateful that you get a vaccine, not everyone in the world will get it.
0/0	I think you'll find that more people will so no to the jab(if they have any sense).
1/1	I think you‚Äôll be just fine. I actually felt relieved and pretty happy once I got my shot. Kind of like a weight was being lifted. Worth it for sure!
0/0	I though a vaccine has to be tested against the actual virus before it should even be called a vaccine for it. Lets just call it what it is. A guess.
1/1	I thought I'll get vaccinated in a year. But visited my doctor yesterday and got a shot spontaneously cause some troll didn't come. It was the Pfizer/Biontech one. I feel great, only one muscle is a little sore. Stay safe an healthy, you guys!
0/0	I thought it was done using the "bypassing all required testing and get it done as quickly as possible approach", combined with the "let's produce tens of millions of doses while we are still testing it, so we can make the most money out of this BS plandemic approach" ...
1/-1	I thought the first wave of vaccines were for emergency workers, hospital workers and other important people?
1/1	I thought the same thing initially to - no way would I be first to get the vaccine...after almost a year of COVID, I'm SO ready for my shot! I want to be able to hug my dad again....and not worry about my mom. I want my daughter to get back to school
0/1	I told my mom I wanna join the volunteer group but being a typical asian she gave me that deadly stare..its not the virus I'm scared of
0/0	I told people do not take that dam vaccine, but no one would listen...
1/1	I too had chicken pox but mine weren't to bad no scars. At 56 my doctor had me get the shingles vaccine as my insurance paid for it. Soon as I'm allowed I'll get the Covid vaccine. Like the flu. I was so sick in 1995 from it that was enough. I get the flu vaccine yearly & haven't had the flu again
1/1	I took Astra with weissbier...no side effects :)
1/1/1/1/1	I took Pfizer yesterday am fatigued and Have chills am Glad I took off today bc I wouldn't have been able to go to work but other than that am fine arm a Lil sore which is to be expected
1/1	I took it, I am immune compromised due to a chronic illness. I got the J&J shot. Sore arm for two days, oddly I sneezed more often for a week. No issues. In its favor I am a redhead and allergic to tons of stuff so to have so little reaction I was quite surprised.
1/-1	I took mine and now I feel like I have the flu. It‚Äôs working! :dancer: Thank You Science!!:heart:
1/1	I took mine on Tuesday. Felt like a normal flu shot and my arm was sore for 2-3 days.
1/1	I took my first shot of the vaccine today and advise you all to take it
1/-1	I took my mum for hers this week, I'm just hoping for the best I'm petrified of her getting covid it's been a hard week since its been offered trying to decide I just hope and pray we made the right decision
0/-1	I took my second dose yesterday and omg I feel like I‚Äôm dying. Fever, throwing up , chills and body aches.
1/0	I took my sister to get her vaccine at Creighton University yesterday, and I was surprised/happy to see hundreds of people waiting in line to get their vaccines. #mavorg
0/0	I took no vaccine and doing excellently well. I guess every individual must decide what he/she is comfortable with. No one can live or die for you. So be yourself and make your choice. For me, I will never take this vaccine.
0/-1	I took sputnik second dose .. and i tested positive after a week.
0/1	I took the J&J yesterday and today y‚Äôall pulled it from the market because of blood clot scares wtf
1/1	I took the Johnson&Johnson b4 it got took off the shelves and I feel fine other than a small sinus feeling in my throat and nose.
1/1	I took the Pfizer vaccine when offered and also have a multitude of allergies. I was a bit anxious but... all went fine. No reaction at all. To some commenters, who are fearful, please do a risk and benefit analysis when thinking about taking the vaccine. Your risk of getting the virus is far greater than having an adverse reaction.
0/0	I took the flu shot but won't take covid vaccine
1	I took the vaccine I feel fine, I highly recommend you take it Although it‚Äôs a free country it‚Äôs ultimately up to you Thank you for your service.
1/1	I totally trust the covid vaccine

1/1	I trust the vaccine.
0/0	I trust this vaccine like i trust my government! Not at all!
0/0	I try to convince people of the many amazing plant remedies but very few people are interested as they seem not to understand the delicacy and need for fine tuning of the human system and why shoving inadequately tested poisons in is not good .
0/0	I turned off the news and covid disappeared! Hahaha
1/1	I understand and support the priorities of who gets the vaccine first. However, I am also counting the days when I can get vaccinated
0/0	I understand it doesn‚Äôt stop you getting Covid or stop you passing it on to others.
1/1	I understand that this vaccine can be scary for people. But it has been worked on by the entire world. Scientists have had a chance to finally have unlimited budget to get something pushed through that they have been working on since 2003. Replace your fear and uncertainty with evidence and knowledge.
0/0	I understand that we are not at risk so don't force us to do what you want
1/1	I understand the anti-vax argument. But... no. Vaccines save lives. Vaccines have saved millions (if not billions) of lives. You don‚Äôt have to like something to acknowledge it‚Äôs beneficial to individuals and to society.
0/0	I understand their refusal. This vaccine was rushed and the long term effects are unknown.
1/-1/0	I understand why the at risk and older ones are receiving the vaccination first but if there are any side effects then it will probably be put down to their age let's see what the younger more active people say
0/0	I understand your confidence in the vaccines, but remember when we were told the new diet drug Fem-fem was safe? I'm going to wait a while and let others try it out first.
1/1	I urge everyone to get the vaccine when they are offered it. It is safe, will help save lives and is the route out of the pandemic.
1/1	I used my MOM VOICE super powers on my young mortgage broker to get him to schedule his first Covid vaccine shot. He'll email me the time and place of his first shot... with his request for my financial documents.
0/0	I used to be a huge proponent of vaccination, until I watched ‚ÄúVaxxed‚Äù documentary. That made me loose trust.
1/1	I used to be anti vaccine. This week I got my eldest son (aged 3) his first vaccines and his younger brother is getting his in the next couple of week. As a mother I was terrified to harm my child with vaccines. My 3 year old didn‚Äôt even have a temperature after his injections. Don‚Äôt let fear stop you from protecting your children and it‚Äôs also ok to realise that you were wrong
0/-1	I used to think doctors were brilliant
1/1	I vaccinate because I believe in science

0/0	I want a guarantee from the company selling covida vaccine. The guarantees from the government are unfounded and absurd because it has sold the Nation and it falls every day. In the case of vaccine complications, I bring a case to the Court for damages of millions. compensation from the Government are nonsense .. because they don't have their money ... only ours. How am I supposed to pay myself compensation ... total nonsense

1/1/1	I want the vaccine, but I'm about to start 5 rounds of radiation and chemo soon, and someone told me that the since that will pretty much ruin my immune system, it would take out the effects of the vaccine anyway. Is that true of an RNA vaccine?
0	I want the vaccine. I‚Äôm scared of needles. But I really want it. I had my flu, and the latest one, anti rabies shot while strapped down to a chair with people restraining me and local anesthetic.

0/-1	I want to wait and see how it works before getting vaccinated
0/0	I want to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù how the vaccine is working for others before getting vaccinated themselves.
0/0	I warned my parents, If you wanna end up in a fucking tomb. Its best to wait. But they said, no muh Johnson and Johnson. What boomers. This entire vaccine is cyberpunk 2077 but with death
0/0	I was 20 when this started, I‚Äôll be 22 next month. These are the years I‚Äôm supposed to look back on when I‚Äôm older. I‚Äôm so depressed I haven‚Äôt experienced anything in life yet. I WILL NOT be forced to take this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù.
0/0	I was 50/50 on deciding if I would take it not. Now it‚Äôs a 100% chance I won‚Äôt be taking it.
1/1	I was a Guinea pig as you put it and hello I'm still here
1/1	I was a bit sceptical about the Covid vaccine, but after listening to anti-vaxxers, I have now fully changed my mind and I‚Äôm 100% pro vax. No way I‚Äôm associating myself with these idiots
1/1	I was a wait and see and I was vaccinated last week with J&J and I am fine
1/1	I was actually worried about the vaccine, but knowing they didn't cut corners makes me feel 100% better. Thank you so much for posting it, my family will absolutely vaccinate as soon as we can
1/0	I was an absolute pro-vaxxer as well. TTAV series changed me. I am not Anti-Vaccine But I do think Vaccines are not as safe as we are told. Definitely a risky business!
1/1	I was at more risk in getting a blood clot when I was on the contraceptive pill. There is always a small risk in anything you do or take on a daily basis. I have had the AZ jab even though that risk is there.
0/1	I was beyond hesitate to get the vaccine. But once I got in contact with 3 fellow coworkers, and tested negative for 2 weeks. I didn‚Äôt want to chance another another scare and risk my loved ones who are still at home. I did it for my love ones...
1/1	I was born in 1965 with rubella, my mother tells how it was the scariest thing that ever happened in her life when I nearly died as a newborn. I dont know why I was lucky enough to survive, without life long issues related to rubella. Vaccines have saved millions of children since 1965, babies are vulnerable, it's so important to vaccinate yourself and protect them.
1	I was called a child abuser by an anti-vaxxer once. How ironic.
0/0	I was conflicted until I spoke with my doctor. Since the CDC does not know all the side effects. and adverse effects of taking either vaccine. I declined and will continue to isolate.
0/0	I was contacted by my local surgery today for the sole purpose of arranging an appointment for the "Covid 19 injection", I swiftly thanked the caller for not referring to the injection as a vaccine, then politely refused the invatation with a request to never contact me again in reference to this experiment again. You the reader would be well advised to responsibly research this trial and it's exact purpose before consenting to enter into an agreement to what I understand is a non reversable genetic modification to your natural body.
0/0	I was excited about getting my first shot today till the nurse advised me to be ready to call 911 should I experience shortness of breath or skin rash afterwards!
1/1	I was fortunate and grateful to get the first dose of my #COVID19 vaccine today
0/0	I was getting the vaccine. After seeing this, I am not. My kids need me. They lost their dad in 2013. I‚Äôm all they have left. I‚Äôll take my chances without the vaccine.
1/1	I was given the pfizer vaccine and I'm still alive and had no side effects.
1/1	I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it

1/1	I was hoping for your usual introduction. But thanks for this video. I can‚Äôt wait for my vaccine.
0/-1	I was in perfect health then did my first round. I have had an accelerated heart beat day and night for almost a month since the vaccination. Now there is great pressure on me to take the second shot. Don't know what to do.
1/1	I was in the study, I now have immunity, the side effects were minor.
1/1	I was in this study. Very safe
0/0	I was just reading an article in new republic independent propaganda news online... under an article under the apocalypse category, called something like ‚Äòare we ready for the vaccine‚Äô ... they talked about the ‚Äòquick‚Äô method they are using for future plandemics... they are planning to create more pandemics to scare the sheeple for more vaccines. This is not going to be the last of these plandemics.
1/1	I was just talking to a friend who's waiting for the vaccine. At first he thought he would have no trouble getting the shot, but apparently a lot more people are volunteering so that's a good sign.
0/0	I was listening to a top professor who was talking about the vaccine and they said you might just be immune for 5 months!!! What‚Äôs the point than. Personally I‚Äôm not having any vaccine
1/-1	I was literally waiting to get the vaccine when the video was uploaded
1/1	I was literally waiting to get the vaccine.
1/1	I was lucky I got my first dose of Moderna, get next on APRIL 7TH.
1/1	I was nervous about having mine, not least because I‚Äôm scared of needles and because i had heard about side effects. However in my case the jab was one of the easiest I‚Äôve ever had and aside from my arm feeling like I‚Äôd been punched the following day, i had no other issues. I strongly recommend everyone having it when possible.
0/0	I was never an anti vaxxer but covid 19 lies & manipulation has turned me into one.
1/-1	I was offered the J&J shot and turned it down. I waited a few weeks until Pfizer was available and got that instead. My only side effect was feeling tired for a day after my first shot. I get my second shot in a week.
0/-1	I was once a herpes patient, but now I have finally got rid of it with the help of Ben Uda on youtube channel, with his Herbal medicine which he prepare for me.
1/1	I was part of that trial and had minimal ill effects so i am super excited to be part of a solution like this!
1/1	I was really nervous about getting my jab. The lady that gave it to me was so good I had to ask her whether she has done it, I had looked away of course, she said yes. I guess she had got quite a lot of practice. Less nervous about jabs in the future.
1/1	I was registered, I was ready. The vaccination clinic was cancelled the day before it was supposed to happen.
1/1	I was scheduled to get a vaccine after seeing my doctor but the appointment was cancelled due to shortages, but if I can get a new appt I am still 100% on board with getting the shot. I will feel much safer
1/1	I was second guessing the vaccine but I‚Äôm ready now!
0/0	I was so happy when I saw the dislike number on this video. If you want a shot, go get it. People don't want it
1/1	I was so relieved after my first dose! Second one 05/03
1/1	I was so relieved my country was getting the vaccine in a few months, I've been neurotically cleaning and staying safe and just when I thought I was in the final lap, I got the Rona üòÇ.
1/1	I was talking to a physician at a regional medical center over the weekend. At his hospital, over 95% of the physicians have chosen to get vaccinated, and just 45% of the nursing staff. I found that disheartening.
1/1	I was thankful to get my 2nd vaccination today.
0/0/0/0/0	I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it‚Äôs being forced. I‚Äôm definitely NOT getting it
1/1	I was vaccinated December but I got Covid, but the good part is that I didn't have any symptoms except of minor running nose and minor headaches for couple of days. So getting covid vaccine was worth it.
1/1	I was vaccinated Siobhain...very sore and nauseated but subsided just waiting for another 10 days for 2nd dose..hope you have got vaccinated thank you for your vlogs.
1/1	I was vaccinated with Moderna, I‚Äôm 61 I have RA, take 2 Humira shots a month so my immune system was compromised to catch COVID-19. I‚Äôve had NO side effects from my vaccine which has been almost a month no. Yes I wear a mask when required and when around a lot of people.
1/1	I was vaccinated with the J&J a couple weeks ago. I had a slight case of the chills that evening, my only side effects. I did not risk my life. I wasn't part of a great conspiracy. I am a adult making a rational decision about my health care. If you feel the need to make ridiculous comments march yourself to the nearest corner for a time out.
1/1	I was vaccinated with the vaccine a couple weeks ago, I had the chills for about 40 minutes that evening. Thats it for side effects and I appreciate that If I get Covid it won't be a serious case. I continue to social distance and mask wearing in indoor public spaces.
1/1	I was vaccinated yesterday, had a high temperature of 38.4C at night and 37.4 as for now (19:00 of the next day). I'm actually happy that I'm among 40k lucky ones. Let's see what happens next.
0/-1	I was vaccinated...I had the chickenpox, measles and the mumps and had the flu on a yearly basis. So what did I have injected in me?
1/-1	I was very curious about this vaccine and a lot of my questions are answered. Thank you.
1/1	I was very happy to see you were vaccinated. Must be a relief.
1/1	I wasn't doubting the vaccine
0/0	I wasn‚Äôt anti vax, saved countless lives they‚Äôre brilliant. However, thanks to the government‚Äôs campaign to coerce me into having the vaccine unnecessarily, I am now sceptical of all vaccines. Thanks.
1/1	I wasn‚Äôt gonna get it but i Changed my mind it‚Äôs either get the vaccine or die from covid and plus it‚Äôs saving people‚Äôs life‚Äôs as well
1/1	I wasvaccinated on 01/22, still doing good! Had mild soreness at site of injection for first two days. No other symptoms, but still monitoring
1/1/1	I watched a lot of videos about the Pfizer vaccine to try and understand how it works but this was the first one that made it clear yet simple to understand. Thank you!
1/-1	I watched the video of the nurse getting vaccine this morning and tried hard to squint to see it (imo correctly) as incredible / exciting as eg SpaceX launches
0/-1	I wear a mask and stay out of big public places.
1/1/0	I wear a mask and take care as much as I could but it's risky either way ,I will take the vaccine when a reliable vaccine is at hand
1/1	I wear my mask and am getting my second dose next week. I don't care what others do. Just if they are ignorant anti mask/anti vax type they should be denied medical care since they didn't believe it to begin with. Cull the stupid.
1/1	I welcome both this article & the vaccine. It's a remarkable achievement. But I can't help wondering whether this type o vaccine is just too expensive & too difficult to transport to have a long term future. Most of us will get something like the Astra Zeneca jab next year. Let's hope the optimum dosage issue can be resolved soon.
1/1	I went with JJ. I felt more comfortable since the vaccine technology is already being used. JJ has similar protection at day 56 and less allergic responses etc. however I did get a fever and severe chills/ muscle aches
0/0	I will #RefuseVaccine
0/0	I will NEVER get it. Hank Aaron just died after getting it a week ago
0/0	I will NEVER take a vaccine. It's the common cold and the survival rate is damn near 100%. I do support Trump but unfortunately he's been fooled in regards to the vaccine. Not really his fault, it's corrupt ass Fauci and MSM feeding the frenzy over nothing. COVID-19 is the COMMON COLD!!!

0/0	I will NOT .i will be homeless and or Starve,Never Been Anti Vax Before But No way No how will i take this Posion,
0/0	I will NOT be a guinea pig for an unnecessary vaccine. Recovery rate is 99.6 %. So why an unproven vaccine. Try it out in 3rd world countries for the next 5 years and I might consider it.
0/0	I will NOT be taking this. Our society is in big trouble because people are not using their brains!

0/0/0	I will NOT take the COVID-19 vaccine.
0/0	I will absolutely refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine.

We haven‚Äôt seen my family since February, including my elderly father in Ireland who is not in the best of health, and the Spanish family since Christmas. Two of my siblings who live in the US haven‚Äôt met my 17-month-old yet and her family on both sides are missing out on some of the most special times of her life.

1/1	I will be getting my covid shot in early February on the occasion of my 75th birthday because I don‚Äôt want to die just now. I‚Äôll do that later at a time of my own choosing.
1/1	I will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
1/1	I will be happy to get vaccinated as soon as it‚Äôs available to me. I am not a scientist any more, but I generally trust the drug companies to do their jobs correctly, and not put out a vaccine that is extremely unsafe.
1/1	I will be in line as soon as it is offered!
1/1	I will be in quarantine for a full year on March 2nd I GENUINELY hope I have mine by then. I just got a letter from my doctors (post lung transplant clinic) today saying ‚ÄúCOVID has highly adverse risks‚Äù - for you etc. then ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know anything essentially‚Äù. This is the first letter in the pandemic they‚Äôve sent me at all I‚Äôm just here like ????? at this point. I just want my shot and this to be done.
0/1	I will be placing a curse on every evangelical, baptist,pro lifer, all lives matter, bigots. We are so tired of your existence. You say ‚Äúnot all‚Äù but you are apart of ‚Äúall‚Äù. Since they won‚Äôt take the vaccine I‚Äôll make sure that they get covid .
0/0	I will be refusing the vaccine, because I will not let the government control my body. I will not let the government to alter my DNA either. The vaccine modifies a persons DNA, even Moderna admits this. Just check their website. GOD does not want us to change/alter our DNA. DNA is sacred. DO NOT take the vaccine.
0/0	I will be taking a very cautious wait to see how the vaccines play out. I had an extremely bad experience with the flu vaccine many years ago.
1/1	I will be taking it, no doubt. Got vulnerable family members.

1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/0	I will definitely get the vaccine,but I want to give it some time before I do.
1/1	I will definitely take it. But I have a feeling that the Covid vaccines are more of a flu shot type of vaccine where you will have to take another few shots till the vaccine is perfect and able to fend off the new variant strains. That's is my opinion.
1/1	I will definitely take the vaccine. I will still get Covid sooner or later. Better to get vaccinated than to be infected with a fully developed disease by some disgusting laboratory virus from China.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I will die before I‚Äôm forced to get jabbed. I refuse to put that poison in my body!!

0/0	I will not do this voluntary. You people must realize that in any other case a vaccin takes years to make and test and now 3verbody is willing to accept something that is made and tested in 8 months it is not a matter of disease control. It is a matter of controlling us

1/1	I will take any vaccine just let me have one.
1/1	I will take it
1/1	I will take it at the first opportunity it is offered. I feel like there are theoretical concerns about mRNA vaccines, but in statistical probability of actually occuring based on the results of the trials already conducted? Obviously we don't have the full trials to really know the risk, but it's enough for me
1/1	I will take it because intelligent people did proper research.
1/1	I will take it or I am gonna dieee
1/1	I will take it the minute I can. I dont care about any side effects or damage people claim it does.
1/1/1/1	I will take it, I think that although I‚Äôm not very comfortable with the idea that it‚Äôs brand new and not a massive amount of information regarding side effects, I would very much like to be able to attempt to get society and general life back on track as at present (in the UK) being locked down and unable to see loved ones is putting a lot of negatives on my mental health.
1/1	I will take it. I have had all my vaccinations and so have my children. We have never had any side effects. I‚Äôm not worried about this one!

1/1	I will take vaccine side effects 1,000 times over if it means I can hug my dad without fear of getting him sick. 10 days until I‚Äôm home
1/1	I will take whatever they offer me as soon as I can. Frankly, I think we‚Äôve gotten very bad at assessing risk in all this. The risk of a clot due to COVID is much higher than the risk of a clot due to a vaccine, so please, hook it to my veins!
1/1	I will take whatever vaccine is offered as soon as possible.
1/1	I will take whichever vaccine whenever I‚Äôm eligible to get one. Each vaccine dose is a rock to break down the pandemic wall between us all.
1/1	I will wait for a different vaccine, not a j&j one. They have blood on their hands.
0/0	I will wait to get the covid vaccine until it is proven safe. My son died in 2006 from a reaction to the anthrax vaccine when he was in the army! They said it was safe too! I do get a flu shot every year, not against vaccines just don't like the ones that aren't fully tested.
0/0	I will wait until I see what happens to those who received the vaccine üíâ. It‚Äôs not 100% effective... that makes me feel apprehensive

0/0	I wish more melanated people would do their research instead of trusting the vaccine
1/1/1/1/1	I wish more people would watch this and understand that this is not poison this is not going to change your RNA. So many people don't understand science
1/1	I wish my postal carrier housemate would get hers too, but she doesn't want to take it until it's been many months to be sure there is no side effects. Do to my comorbidities, covid would probably kill me, so it's a clear choice. I wish it was for her, too, but alas, it isn't.
1/1	I wish nobody was antivax... But your speech reminded me of Idiocracy. It was not supposed to be a documentary... But, scientifically talking, there is another thing when a part of the population recuses to get the vaccines: the natural selection is also available to the viruses: stronger mutations appear and spread, including more fatal new variations... And it makes the vaccination loses strength. Vaccination, to be effective, needs to be respected as a collective pact...
1/1	I wish people would take it seriously so we can try to get back to normal in the future
0/1	I wish people would understand that the science behind this ‚Äúnew‚Äù type of vaccine is more than two decades old.

1/1	I wish there was a vaccine against stupidity and paranoia.
1/1	I wish there was a vaccine for stupidity. A lot of people lacking evidence in their claims against vaccines.
1/1	I wish there was a way to make being antivax punishable by death. That is the only thing that can stop them.
1/1	I wish these people would take a few science classes before making a decision.
1/1	I wish they would have Started with younger people who have Children who need both of there parents,
1/1/1	I wish this mRNA thing works out and we get to have faster and more effective vaccines for now on. The flu vaccine is not even 50% effective and this new vaccine is about 95% effective.

1/1	I wonder how many people here making comments would have shunned the polio vaccine. Or the measles or all of the other vaccines that came out years ago. Everybody seems to think they are a doctor.

0/0	I won‚Äôt be taking a vaccine for covid. I don‚Äôt take a flu vaccine either, even though I‚Äôve been offered it, simply because it‚Äôs my choice. I‚Äôm not anti-vax nor am I an idiot. If someone decides to take it then that‚Äôs their choice. Respect both choices or non.

If it‚Äôs so safe, why does the manufacturer need to be absolved of liability?!

0/0	I work in healthcare. We've had 3 elderly people who took this vaccine and ended up in emergency situations (fainting, hard to breathe, etc). I personally, don't trust it because I am black. I remember the Tuskegee experiment they unleashed in my ancestors. These vaccines aren't made with all ethnicities genetics in mind.
1/1	I work in senior living and we are anticipating receiving our vaccines mid/end of January - early February. I‚Äôm nervous to get it but I‚Äôm thankful to be apart of one of the ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù to have the opportunity to receive it

1/1	I work in the NHS in the UK as a key worker and have just had my 1st dose of the Pfizer jab today Only symptom so far is a bit of a sore arm! (Like the flu jab)
1/1	I work in the office of a nursing home. When I talked to family members of our guests about side effects when they were asked to give consent to get the elderly people vaccinated I prefered to call the expected side effects vaccine reactions or immune reactions. And told them that showing some of them is a good sign that the body is working well
1/1	I work in vaccines and watching my company and my industry snap into action and do what we were all built to do is inspiring. Lots of research teams and small biologics companies have been quietly preparing for this. Building the technologies and the production capacity is a decades long project, all we are seeing now is what it looks like when you mobilize it.
1/1/1	I worried about bringing covid home incessantly this past year & my choice of caring for covid patients would make my kids sick. After what I have seen this year, I can not explain how grateful I am for this vaccine and how grateful I am that my whole family is now protected.
1/1	I worry we won't hit 75%. Not because of a lack of effort or trying. I'm afraid that 35% of the damn country is going to be stupid enough to refuse the vaccine.

1/1	I would gladly volunteer for the phase III trials of any of the vaccines.
1/1	I would go get one and pay for it out my own pocket right now if it meant I could get a covid passport and increase my chances of getting out of this country as quickly as possible
1	I would have no problem with a vaccine booster every 3 months if it makes this go away
1/1/1/1	I would heavily advise you to get the vaccine but I can't force you to. Furthermore, you will probably lose your job if you work directly with people, so as not to put others at risk. Regardless, please reconsider and if I can help in anyway provide some comfort or information to persuade you, please let me know.
1/1	I would just like to be able to get the vaccine. It will take forever to vaccinate people at the rate. It is pathetic how this is being done.
0/0	I would like to be able to choose which vaccine I will be taking that would make me go from no to yes. but because you want to force vaccines banned in other countries in me I have to say no most likely not until the freedom to choose which one you want is available. Plus I really wanted the Russian one so I'm picking some vaccine which is not as good to begin with.
1/1	I would like to extend my personal thanks to all the scientific and medical staff who have worked so tirelessly throughout this whole damn thing. We are no there yet but these vaccine trials look very promising.
1/1	I would like to get a vaccine that is safe and very effective

0/0	I would rather have a lion roar in my face for 1 minute than to take the covid vaccine
0/0	I would rather have covid and take my chances with the 0.07 percent of making me ill
0/0	I would rather have covid every year for the rest of my life than put this mystery BS in my system.
1/1	I would rather have side effects from the vaccine than Covid I felt like l had won the lottery last Sunday when l received my 1st Pfizer vaccine. I may of had a sore arm and felt tired for a few days, but when you've been shielding due to being extremely vulnerable it's nothing!
0/0	I would rather inject covid (99.3% survival rate according to BBC) than the experimemtal vaccine which you still can get covid after taking.
0/0	I would rather take my chances with covid and my Maker than the vaccine.
0/0	I would rather take the fertilized chicken egg with the virus, better vaccine
0/0	I would refuse to take the Coronovirus vaccine if it has the Microchip and Nanobots in it. These would control you and make you docile. Wake up forks.
1/1	I would roll my sleeve up for the vaccine today if it were available.
1/1/1	I would say anybody is mandatory vaccination to go to work, travel, school. End of the pandemic and free shots for everybody
1/1	I would say yes most definitely, I have unfortunately not taken vaccines yet because my first vaccine I took caused me to have a 5 hour seizure and almost die but yes I would strongly recommend to take the Covid vaccine when I comes out for the safety of you and others.
0/0	I would stay away from this shot as it will reprogram you cells and your body will create a protein very similar to that in the covid19. Your body will constantly make it and you can never detox this out of your system like regular vaccines. So in the future, when your body comes across another coronavirus like a cold or a mutated strain of covid, your body will not see it as an intruder in your system and will not create antibodies to fight it. All of the animals, in the short amount of testing they've done on them, have died. so they suspended testing on animals and went straight to humans.
1/1	I would take AstraZeneca if I was offered it.
1/1	I would take any of them, except SINOVAC
1/1	I would take it. It will be a year since I saw my family and uk friends soon. I need to travel. No idea what the situation will be for ex pats like me? Do we get offered a vaccine here or do I have to go back to the uk to get one and put myself at risk in the process?
1/1	I would take the COVID vaccine and I would do it as soon as possible. Reason is that the virus is picking up mutations and the efficacy against new variants maybe reduced. The vaccine will have to be modified and if you miss this round you may have to wait a while.
1/1/1	I would take the COVID vaccine and I would do it as soon as possible. Reason is that the virus is picking up mutations and the efficacy against new variants maybe reduced. The vaccine will have to be modified and if you miss this round you may have to wait a while. It‚Äôs probably better to take this now and have protection. And take the next one next year when it‚Äôs available.
1/1	I would take the vaccine, even with all the conspiracy stories I hear about with how ‚Äúfake‚Äù the virus is and how the vaccine just wants to ‚Äúpatent‚Äù our DNA.
1/1	I would translate this video for free in Arabic, our culture suffer from sharing conspiracy theories!
1/-1	I would wait for one of the two superior ones unless I had a job that required in person work.
0/-1	I would wait until some studies of the long term effects it can have.
1/1	I would, if I could get one!
1/1	I would, too, to get vaccinated; however, here in Southern California our doctor‚Äôs office doesn‚Äôt have the vaccine, the pharmacy don‚Äôt have the vaccine and trying to get an appointment with LA county health department takes hours and then once you have the appointment and wait in line for hours they run out! So yeah cheer all you want about how easy and painless it is while the rest of us wait and wait and wait.
1/1	I would. I find the risks to be acceptable. Also, my #1 fear with covid isn't that I'll get sick, it's that I will give it to my vulnerable family members, or vulnerable people in the community. I would never forgive myself if I skipped out on a safe covid vaccine and then gave covid to someone who died or had serious complications.
1/1	I would. Waiting for sign off by my oncologist but I‚Äôm s/p allogenic BMT after being diagnosed with ALL in 2016. I have been following up with some ID mentors and they all think the data is very promising and don‚Äôt see any major red flags as of yet. I realize there‚Äôs a lot more to come but I have been scared shitless working as a hospitalist with multiple vented and ICU patients with COVID despite appropriate PPE.
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't be so skeptical but bill gates is involved in the vaccine. He is banned for putting birth control in vaccines in Africa. He gave talks a month before the By virus came out saying next pandemic will be a corona virus....just too coincidental. He is also on tape talking about population control-!
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't get this vaccine no way done in 8 months!!! MUMPS TOOK 4YRS..
0/0	I wouldn't give this vaccine to my dog never mind me.
0/0	I wouldn't have that shit pumped into my body regardless
0/-1	I wouldn't mind getting yearly shot but I had a reaction to both shots and I really don't wanna keep going through that unless I absolutely have to. I hate missing weeks of work.
0/-1	I wouldn't say it's "safe", all biological therapies carries a risk, and that's the first thing they should know. The thing is, covid vaccine is rushed asf.
0/0	I wouldn't take a Covid jab.
0/0	I wouldn't take a vaccine that hasn't been authorized by the NHS.
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't take any vaccine or any medication that was exempt from Criminal litigation as a result of damage to the recipient.
0/0	I wouldn't trust coronavirus vaccine
1/1	I wouldn't worry, every immune response is different does not mean it is not working...my wife also had a huge reaction to her shingles shot, but very little to no reaction to either shot of the pfizer vaccine...
0	I wouldn‚Äôt get this vaccine if they paid me a million dollars!!
0/0	I wouldn‚Äôt put that poison in my body for any amount of money, and I am going on 75! Too many deaths from the vaccine that they don‚Äôt want out! I was hearing yesterday that the deaths from the vaccine are being listed as Covid deaths! I shudder at this vaccine...long term effects not known!
1/1	I' m so happyyyyy! My dad has an appointment for vaccination against covid!
0/1	I'LL PASS CRAZY DUDE
1/1	I'M DOING MY PART!
0/0	I'M NOT TAKING THIS HOKIS POKIS VACCINE!!
0/-1	I'am not getting the shots! PERIOD!
0/0	I'am not getting the shots! PERIOD! There some flake one out there, and people are coming down with side effect TOO> WAY TO EARLY TO GET EM ~ I'am not going to be there Guinea Pigs
0/0	I'am rolling with what works and it does not include a vaccine. What are people going to do when they start dropping dead in the streets in a year or 2?
1/1	I'd absolutely get it. I just finished chemo last month and live in a COVID hotspot.
1/1	I'd absolutely get it. I just finished chemo last month and live in a COVID hotspot. Honest question, does anyone know of any factual or evidence-based reasons to be concerned about an mRNA vaccine that isn't just theoretical? I understand it may be too early to know. But I am much too far out from molecular biology to remember all of it.
0/0	I'd be dead before I take that vaccine. Actually, I'd not even let my corpse take it.
1/1	I'd bet the correlation between the vaccine skeptics and financial inadequacy is through the roof for any given cohort of people. In short, the stupidest portion of any group of people are the ones most skeptical of the vaccines.
1/1	I'd definitely get the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, assuming they release data and it checks out (including safety data). Widespread vaccination could end this pandemic and save hundreds of thousands of lives. I may be low risk myself, but I have a responsibility to society. Not just as a physician, but as a person.
1/1	I'd definitly recommend it if you have access to corona vaccine!
1/1	I'd like to be vaccinated. I'm en expat living in Vietnam, do I have any chances to get a vaccine Sputnik here?:)
1/1	I'd like to thank you for sharing this information with everyone. It was interesting to learn about the vaccine process.
1/1	I'd like to think this will finally put the doubts about this vaccine to bed, partially with our continental neighbours.. But I'm not hold my breath.
0/0	I'd like to wait 2 years for it.
0/0/1/0	I'd love to see another video with both of you getting the vaccine and then reporting a day a week later how your feeling
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'd love to see the people who developed these vaccines and their families lining up to get them first, in droves. Where are the studies? Where is the transparency?
0/0	I'd might take it if it wasn't a RNA vaccine. I don't have a lot of contact to people and especially not to risk groups atm, so i don't see it as a necessity. Due to both my parents working in the medical sector i'm not that fond of new pharmaceutical products because sometimes (light or heavy) side effects can occur that were missed in the testing phase. Especially with an RNA vaccine i'd rather be careful in the beginning than sorry afterwards. I feel like a lot of people are too based on emotion instead of assessing the situation based on facts because of how the first stages of the outbreak went and how bad that was managed in many places. Just keep your masks on, keep your distance and stay at home if you're feeling sick. The situation we have now is because people can't follow the rules and a vaccine won't mean that this situation will be over within a month
1/1	I'd much rather take those side effects then get covid.
1/1	I'd rather believe the scientists than your facebook conspiracies, to be honest.
0/0	I'd rather catch covid than allow a jab rewrite my immune system. This is NOT a vaccine.
0/0	I'd rather escape and life alone somewhere in the Forests than giving away my precious DNA

0/0	I'd rather get the virus than this vaccine. The virus isn't as bad as they make out.

1/1	I'd rather have the side effects from the vaccine than covid.
0/0	I'd rather inject myself with runnypoo
0/0	I'd rather not get the vaccine, either.
1/1	I'd rather risk a Covid-19 vaccine side effect as opposed to actually getting covid-19
1/1	I'd rather roll the dice with unknown long term effects than getting COVID.
0/0	I'd rather swallow disinfectants.
0/0	I'd rather take a mixed cocktail from Bill Cosby than a vaccine made by Bill Gates. Don't take it.
0/0	I'd rather take my chances on not getting it.
0/0	I'd rather take my chances with Covid19 with a survival rate of 99.6% I think I'll be fine, and if you've had a vaccine you shouldn't be able to get Covid so me being vaccinated or not should have zero affect on you're lifes because if you take the vaccine and can stil catch it then what was the purpose of the vaccine in the 1st place.
1/1	I'd say that in a pandemic common sense should be in play. Get vaccinated.
0/0	I'd sooner trust a pack of hungry wolves than Big Pharma.
0/0/0	I'd trust an email from a Nigerian Prince before a Bill Gates vaccine.
0/0	I'll ask big pharma if vaccines are safe.
1/1	I'll be adding 1 to these numbers soon. Getting my first Pfizer shot on Tuesday. I preferred J&J for a number of reasons but after weeks of trying and failing to get an appt I decided to just go with what was available. Gotta drive an hour an a half, 80 miles away in the next county over, missing a day of work but I'll do whatever it takes to put this year of hell behind me.
0/0	I'll be avoiding the vaccine unless I have to have a damned "vaccine passport" to live "normally"
0/0	I'll be dead before I voluntarily accept your vaccine.
1/1/1	I'll be first in line for this vaccine!

0/0	I'll give it a few years. So that we know that there are neither short term or long term effects from it.
0/0	I'll have a more severe reaction to the vaccine than I ever would with the virus, so why get the vaccine?
1/1	I'll have anytime any where given the chance. No hesitation.
1/1	I'll have my vaccine next Thursday, can't wait! What about the side effects you ask? Go read up on the side effects of covid 19, I hear the most common one is death!! I'll take my chances with the wee jab in my arm, backed by thousands of experts and scientists rather than risk catching covid!
0/0	I'll have the vaccine - when it's been around a lot longer and all the side effects are known
0/0	I'll hold off until all the beta testing has been completed and a true body count issued.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'll just live my life with out it !!!!

0/0	I'll look after my own health thanks. I don't need a flu shot or vaccines.
0/0	I'll mop the ocean dry before I take this shot.

0/0	I'll pass on the shot
0/0	I'll pass. I've already had covid and it's totally worth the 2 weeks off work. Wouldn't mind getting it again
1/1	I'll probably do it as soon as it is avaiable for me. I'm neiter a person-at-risk, nor someone that often comes in contact with this group, so I expect I'll have to wait quite a while.
1/1/1	I'll probably do it as soon as it is avaiable for me. I'm neiter a person-at-risk, nor someone that often comes in contact with this group, so I expect I'll have to wait quite a while. In the meantime, I read up on the current scientific progress on the vaccine as often as possible.
0	I'll put my trust in mother nature, thanks a lot
1/1	I'll recommend taking a COVID 19 vaccine

0	I'll wait. thx for the explanation though.
1/1/-1/-1	I'm "almost" ready to get this vaccine, however, I have a question that I'm hoping you can answer. If our own cells are making the spike protein - which causes the body to attack - isn't that be definition an autoimmune response? How are we going to prevent this vaccine from causing autoimmune response, i.e., the body attacking our own cells (which are making this spike protein)?
1/1	I'm 15, so I legally can't get any Vaccines until I'm 16 (in like 7 more months). I hate my life.
1/1	I'm 19. I just received my first Pfizer Vaccine, second coming in two weeks
1/1	I'm 21 and when the vaccines arrived at the beginning I just went to the clinic without an appointment and got my shots. I havent experienced any side effects.
1/1	I'm 22 turning 23 this month I've already had first shot of the vaccine they made me wait 15 mins before leaving and its already been a week or so I've been moving around in the heat sweating the days away working and cutting grass still and haven't had any side effects yet!!!üòÖ
1/1	I'm 26 and I still feel tired and out of breath everyday, this a few months after I got covid. Not saying what you're saying isn't true, but I don't wish that on anyone so everyone please get the vaccine and stay healthy!
1/1	I'm 28 and healthy and got my first dose yesterday! I work with the public though. My arm is very sore but I'm so relieved.
0	I'm 30 days out from my first dose of Covishield. The maker does NOT recommend waiting 4 MONTHS for 2nd dose. When can I get mine?
1/1	I'm 31 years old and just got vaccinated a few months ago. Go us OP!
1/1	I'm 33 year old and want the vaccine. When the demand for eligible participants are low, why can't we loosen the criteria for general population? This is precious medication sitting idle.
1/1	I'm 40, and I'll get it in a heartbeat the second I'm allowed to. Also, let's please please please open up vaccinations to daycare workers, they are so important to supporting everyone
1/1	I'm 50 had the AstraZeneca jab two weeks ago & I will be going for my second one in June. Thank you for this video very interesting as always.
0/0	I'm 50 with fair health. I'll take my chances with the virus. Its fear porn. No, I will not take the vaccine. Even if its mandated. I'll order my food and stay home. I have done it 9 months. What is another year.
1/1/1	I'm 54 and had my first jab 4 weeks ago and the second one is due on 5 June. I've had to travel 15 miles for both but I feel incredibly lucky to have been given this opportunity. I advise everyone to book even if it may be inconvenient
0/0	I'm 60 and smoke and I was going to get it but I've seen a ton more stuff, they cant see, bad jurking, something is very dark about this. They have been trying for 20 yrs to get this made, all the animals ... shaking my head from left to right ....
1/1	I'm 62 and got my poke exactly one week and 10 hours ago. I have to this day, not had any adverse effects at all. I felt a little weird after the shot for a few minutes when I realized I hadn't had lunch yet, then I ate lol. Oh, my arm was a little sore for about an hour after I went back to work but ceased soon. The only effects that I may have encountered is my sense of hearing and smell seemed to be a bit better ( But then again it may be just in my head, he he). Just be aware if you feel weird for an extended period, it couldn't hurt to see a Doc. Good luck all, we will get through this!!!
1/1	I'm 66 years in USA, I was required by law, as a child to have every vaccination of value for young children. Then I was vaccinated the hell out of when I joined the US Navy in boot camp. I've had tetanus shots, pneumonia shots, shingles, flu shots the last 10 years. I'm as perfectly healthy and more so than others my age or even younger. So,,, F you, you anti-vaccination aholes! Stop being dicks!
1/1	I'm 70 tomorrow (Wednesday) & get my jag on Thursday. Everyone I speak to, whether in the city or in rural Ayrshire, very impressed with the whole vaccination process.
1/1	I'm 71 disabled housebound, got asthma, COPD and sleep apnea and i am terrified that I will die before I get vaccinated....are you
0/0	I'm NEVER going to get the vaccine because I'm vaccine injured and also have allergies.

1/1	I'm PRO-vaccine, was vaccinated, healthy, and alive. Go, Doctor Baldwin!!! We're with you!
0/0	I'm THE only person that decides what goes into my body.
0	I'm Very Lucky. My Creator gave Me a Damn Good Immune System. Sorry about Your problem
0/0	I'm a 68 year old white woman and I have no plans to take the vaccine until it is closer to 99.9% safe. And the way people in charge of the vaccine want to give it out to Non White People first I would be really cautious about taking to shot first based on the color of skin.
1/1	I'm a Nurse and got Covid before the vaccine was released to the public. I plan to get the J&J vaccine this week. I SO DO NOT want to ever get Covid again. It was awful!!
1/1	I'm a big fan of vaccines, they are the single greatest medical achievement.
0/0	I'm a bit concerned about a new company pushing a new treatment as quick as possible. I think it would be best to not immediately use this on a massive scale until years of treatments have been studied.
0/0	I'm a bit vaccin skeptic for me personally there's no incentive to take it, I called the Corona information number from the government to ask what the difference was between getting the virus and being vaccinated against the virus. The woman on the phone actually lied to me. She said that some vaccines are 95% effective and therefore protect for longer‚Ä¶
1/1	I'm a doctor and I knew this would happen long before the vaccine was made. If you give something like this to millions and six people die it's a remarkably good and safe medication.
1/1	I'm a first responder and I can't wait for the vaccine.
1/1/1/1	I'm a first responder and our department is submitting the number of vaccine doses we need on this Friday, so hopefully we"ll be getting them next week, but it may be a but longer. I'm super ready and excited to be getting the vaccinated.
1/-1	I'm a frontline critical key worker, went in for the vaccine, was very nervous about it. After 20 minutes I had a horrible wave of chills and started sweating out, I felt my pulse and it was scary low and the weather was -5c üòÇ after that initial symptom went away, I was okay for the rest of the day but still anxious
1/1	I'm a frontline healthcare worker and plan on doing the same and sharing it on Facebook. Not because I want attention, but because I want to help reassure people and help dispel any false ideas people have regarding the vaccine.
1/1	I'm a healthcare worker and I have my appointment to get it on Friday! I'm so excited.
1/1	I'm a hospital worker in Maine and our vaccination rounds begin tomorrow
1/1	I'm a little worried about long term side effects as it's a new vaccine but as a healthcare worker I trust the science and I'll probably be first in line anyway.
1/1	I'm a med student starting my clinical rotations in January. I'm waiting on absolute tenterhooks for that needle!!
0/0	I'm a nice guy. Someone else can have my dose ;)
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow.
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow...I'm a little nervous, simply because the flu shot usually causes me fatigue and joint pain and I just hate feeling poorly. Hopefully side effects won't be severe.
0/-1	I'm a nurse and no solution in needle and no aspiration of barrel .what is going on??? trickery!!!we don't fall for this mess!!!!
1/1	I'm a physician and America's successful vaccine rollout is bittersweet following my frustration with how the previous administration and a sizable amount of our general public responded to COVID-19 and common decency measures like mask wearing and social distancing. The vaccine rollout is a point of pride for me as a proud American, but I hope our successful vaccine manufacture and distribution will allow us to contribute to vaccination in less wealthy countries, particularly our neighbors in Central and South America.
0/0/0	I'm a pro-Lifer, and I'm not talking about abortion. I am against bioweapons including the covid genetic-manipulation delivery system often (intentionally) mislabeled as a vaccine.

1/1	I'm a teacher. They need to fast track the hell out of this. If our kids are vaccinated, we can go back to school in person without risking our kids or their families
1/1	I'm a-ok with self isolation so I can probably hold off for a bit to make sure people who need it get one. I work from home and have introverted hobbies.
1/1/1/1	I'm about to take the vaccine
1/1	I'm about to take the vaccine üôÜüèæ‚ôÇÔ∏è
0/-1	I'm afraid people have more sense than they think
0/0	I'm afraid the masses will not be awoken. They do no research. They have been made so fearful and anxious by the constant bombardment from the MSM, that they have lost the ability to reason. They could vaccinate them every month and still they'd queue up for it, placid & grateful
0/0	I'm against this Vaccination because is the least of what to do right now
1/1	I'm all for it. If I go to the pub, first, I want to see the vax-passports of the servers and the kitchen people.
1/1/1/1	I'm all for safety, but damn, we need those vaccines now. Wish there was a voluntary system where people who wanted to take the vaccine could.
1/1	I'm all for the passport. And I'm all for anti Vax nutjobs protesting it. Setting up a situation where the these people self remove themselves from interacting with me sounds great.
1/1	I'm all for the vacine.
1/1	I'm all for vaccines
1/1	I'm allergic to eggs and I finally this year was able to find someone who'd give me a flu shot. I felt a little flushed for a few minutes afterwards, but that's it. Much less than the side effect my family suffered of having to put up with me for another year.
1/1	I'm also getting the vaccine and recommend everybody who can get it to get it, including my parents.
0/0	I'm also in NY and not getting it unless I'm forced to. If an employer asks why it took so long, I'll just make shit up about how I was depressed due to lockdowns and couldn't bring myself to go outside. Ezpz
0/0	I'm also not taking the vaccine, we've had many deadly diseases which still doesn't have vaccine
0/0	I'm an "antivaxxer" the same way I'm a "terf". It's a lazy, social shaming slur weaponized by primarily the left to shut down any meaningful discourse, dismiss valid safety concerns, silence the victims of dangerous ideologies & is a convenient excuse to avoid doing any research.
1/1	I'm an essential worker at a hotel (front desk). Last time I got sick, I had a fever over 103 and got pneumonia. And yet, it's still somehow not my turn here in San Diego County... :(
0/0	I'm an organic chemist and I spent most of my time in graduate school synthesizing delivery vehicles to get oligonucleotides INTO cells. Absolutely no way would I take an mRNA vaccine!
0/0	I'm anti government, anti system, anti a lot of things, not anti vax. But in this particular case, i'm not taking the vaccine. I don't want things to go "back to normal". I want things to become better. So this is my form of protest kind of (i'm in Germany)
0/0	I'm anti-Biden and I won't be taking the vaccine
1/1	I'm anti-seatbelt because I can still die or be injured in a car accident.
1/0	I'm as pro-vaccination as they come, but I don't think there's ever been a vaccine so rushed as the one for Covid-19, if anything it feels more like a sort of arms race to who can develop a functional vaccine the quickest. Obviously I get why it's being rushed in the first place, but I am REALLY not going to rush to be the first one to get it.
0	I'm avoiding this possible poison as long as I can but I'm sure there are ways to make me and others that agree take the vaccine (or whatever the hell it is), they're ready for us
0/0	I'm boosting my immune system naturally by taking vitamin D and eating healthy i wont be taking a rushed vaccine
1/1	I'm confident in the development process of the vaccines today.
1/1	I'm conservative and my wife is on dialysis in a center with people from nursing homes. They asked her if she wanted the vaccine. Shes pretty scared about it because it's new and shes worried about future kidney transplants. I've seen what fellow Republicans say about the pandemic and vaccine, but I've also seen what they have said about January 6th. I told her to get the vaccine....
0/0	I'm crying my mom got vaccinated and she has had numerous issues ever since one specifically vision it seems that the ailments that one had previous to vacine is brought to forefront
1/1	I'm curious to know if you feel that there has been enough time to pass to see if there are any long term side effects to the Covid 19 vaccine. it doesn't seem to me that enough time has passed to really find out if there are any side effects. But I'm all for the vaccine, especially if it will save millions of lives.
1/1	I'm currently working a vaccination site on the east coast. We do about 2,000+ vaccinations a day. I worked at a site last month that did 3,000+ a day. And this is just one of hundreds of mass vaccination sites. We're gonna knock this out
1/1	I'm definitely more scared of covid and would do it yearly if I had to.
0/0	I'm definitely not taking it...warp speed my ass
0/0	I'm definitely not taking this vaccine. It's scary.
1/1	I'm definitely taking it
1/1/1	I'm delighted there are no antivaxers in the comment section.
0/-1	I'm disabled, living in low income housing and I tell you I've talked to people here who have gotten the shots and they have felt tired, pain/swelling at the shot site, flu like for symptoms!!
0/0	I'm don't want to get the second jab of AstraZeneca because I'm worried about blood clot issue
1/1	I'm due my second Pfizer vaccine soon as I'm a key worker working in a pharmacy. I'm doing it to protect my mother who has COPD. She was proud of me for getting it done. the only symptom I had was fatigue, I Fell asleep half an hour after getting home from my appointment.
1/1	I'm excited to get my 1st COVID shot later today!! It's one step closer to normalcy!
1/1	I'm extremely excited and hoping to get it soon
1/1	I'm extremely paranoid and would be more than happy to get a vaccine if it meant I wouldn't die.
1/1	I'm fine with another shot if that what it takes.
1/0	I'm fine with it. More vaccine for those who need it.
1/1	I'm from India, I remember the time when polio was so rampant and many kids were left paralyzed. Because most of the kids infected with polio were from poor families the vaccine was provided at a very cheap and affordable rate 1 re ( I'm not very sure of this amount it happened ages ago) This helped eradicate polio from India. The risk of your child getting sick because of a vaccine is so much more lower than your child getting measles and whopping cough. You most probably have gotten vaccinated and so have I and we both turned out fine. You have the opportunity to save your kids, Do it. Your kids will be in pain if they contract diseases that have already been eradicated by a cure.
1/1	I'm from Moscow, Russia. I vaccinated last weak. I' m feeling fine and so are my friends. I believe that vaccination is the best thing to do in this case. Wish you all good health!!!!!
0/0	I'm from the UK and I'm not getting the shot either heard that 30 people died from one of them.
0/0/0/0	I'm from the UK and theres no way I or my family will take this experimental poison .
1/1	I'm front line, still waiting
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated and anyone who is skeptical should know they have being doing research on this since the SARS outbreak nearly 2 decades ago. Covid is a form of SARS. The first time my arm was just super sore for like 2 days and the second time I felt like I had the flu the next day but no arm soreness and no illness past the first day. My mom didn't get sick at all and my stepdad felt like me. I got Moderna.
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated!!
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated. Now for the symptoms. Hit me with your best shot. Fire away... nVm...I'm tired. #Vaccinate
1/1	I'm genuinely happy that the vaccines are gradually coming out so that all the health-care workers can be protected as they are sacrificing their lives and well-being to fight this disease.
1/1/1/1/1	I'm getting a vaccine shot soon who else is getting it soon

1/-1	I'm getting the second dose tomorrow.
1/1	I'm getting the vaccine when it comes available
1/1	I'm getting this one, I rather not trust the tinfoil on the internet
1/1	I'm getting vaccinated on Wednesday!
1/1	I'm glad I got J&J yesterday. I'd hate to wait longer to be vaccinated just because there's a 0.00008% chance of developing blood clots
1/1	I'm glad I got the Pfizer vaccine
1/1	I'm glad I got the Pfizer vaccine over Johnson & Johnson.
0/0	I'm glad I have enough sense not to get the vaccine. Pray hard, eat right, wash your hands, wear a mask and keep it moving.
1/1	I'm glad I'm getting Moderna.
1/1	I'm glad I'm not the only one! I just turned 30 and volunteer at a nursing home and received the vaccine. Onward to herd immunity!
1/1	I'm glad I've already received both doses. I'm doing my part to end this pandemic.
1/1	I'm glad someone realises that our economy won't get back to anything like normal until we have something approaching herd immunity which means people need to be vaccinated now- not later.
0/0	I'm glad that my refusal to be vaccinated bothers you.....it warms my unvaccinated little heart.
1/1	I'm glad that this pandemic finally ends. I wanna get the vaccine as soon as possible.
1/1	I'm glad there are so many antivaxxers, it means more vaccine for me
1/1	I'm glad there are so many antivaxxers. It means more vaccine for me.
0/0	I'm glad there is so many people who believe this is full of BS cause I'm not getting the vaccine and people think I'm crazy. I never got the flu shot either and I didn't get sick. I have worked through covid and still see my family and friends. I'm not sick and they are not sick either. This is all about control and take away freedom and oppress people into slaves. Just one woman's opinion.
1/1	I'm glad there's a vaccine. Once people get the vaccine I want the mask wearing to end. Biggest lesson learned is don't let sick people in our country.
1/1	I'm going to be joining the Johnson & Johnson trial next week so hopefully that one works too
1/-1	I'm going to get vaccine soon and worry about side effects.
0/0	I'm going to not get it, but lie and say that I got it.
0/0	I'm going to risk being a healthy human that relies on my immune system. So far it has worked well for me. Ive been sick once in the last 20 years and ive had a grand total of 3 shots in my entire life- all before the age of 15.
0/0	I'm going to start discouraging people from taking the J&J vaccine. Too many problems.
1/1	I'm going to take it. I just want myself and family to be safe and alive, all that matters at this point.
1/1	I'm going to take it...its the prophesy coming tru this vaccine is the mark of the beast!
1/1	I'm going to wait to hear which vaccine the medcram guy ends up taking and then I'll take the same one.
1/1	I'm gonna get the vaccine to protect the people around me.
1/1	I'm gonna vaccine myself
0/0/0	I'm gonna wait till the 'human trials" are complete,absolute fookin insanity.
0/0	I'm good y'all can skip me on that vaccine.
0/0	I'm good. You can have my covid vaccine along with my flu vaccine
0/0	I'm good... Kick me off that list please. hmu again in 5-10 years and then start from the beginning and try to convince me to take it but for now... Hard pass.
1/1	I'm grateful to have an opportunity to say thank you to one of the many that helped bring these vaccines to reality. From the bottom of my heart, thank you! This was all hands on deck in a global way. It's incredibly inspiring and is something that has helped me stay positive through the pandemic.
0/0	I'm guessing this has more to do with vaccines being rushed than anything else. I remember feeling the same way about the talks of early vaccines because I didn't think they'd be testing enough
1/1	I'm happy for the people who don't want the jab. It means the rest of us move up the queue faster.
1/1	I'm happy that people are really trying so hard to save our lives and we are really thankful for this amazing news may we all be healthy and safe
1/1	I'm happy that there is so many people that want to be vaccinated. My family just got our first shots for those of us who are eligible. My younger brother is the only person in the house too young to get vaccinated yet. I'm looking forward to being able to get some semblance of normal back
1/1	I'm happy to live in such a modern tech society. With vaccines, internet/information.
1/1	I'm happy to report that I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine last Wednesday and I only had one day of feeling a bit crummy. All is well and I am now up-to-date on my vaccinations. ‚Å£
1/-1	I'm happy to wait. Keeps distance anyway.
1/1	I'm happy with that as long as it works. It's pretty much what I had expected. We need annual flu shots. why should we expect this would be different?!
0/0	I'm happy with the way my DNA already works thanks. I dont want anything to change it.
0/0	I'm healthy I eat natural organic vegetables and fruits every day. I prefer the content of those as oppose to the injection. I imagine it will just disappear in a year or more and all of this will be overshadowed by something else.
1/1	I'm immune compromised and I can't wait to be one of the first to get it!
1/1	I'm immunocompromised, hypertensive I'm immunocompromised, hypertensive and have asthma, you bet your fucking arse I'll be taking it if and when it's offered.and have asthma, you bet I'll be taking it if and when it's offered.
1/1	I'm in England and had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning.
0/0	I'm in Healthcare and will not take the vaccine!
0/0	I'm in Oregon, I refuse to have the vaccine. You Californians have my full support if you don't want to have it either! ü§úü§õ
1	I'm in a high risk group and signed up to get the vaccine ASAP. I'm happy to take it. One thing that makes me angry is that at least in some jurisdictions, folks jump the line with claims that aren't true. "I am a daycare worker." (person is retired, watches grandchild once a week.) It just really gets to me. There are people who risk their lives, and you're jumping the line? ... .. yeah no I will not talk to you again.
1/1	I'm in favor of a vaccine passport. Not so much to make sure you're vaccinated although that's nice too. I just don't want to be around the type of person who is against vaccines. Let them self select right out of everything.
1/1	I'm in favor of taking the vax
0/0	I'm in no particular hurry
1/1/1	I'm in the Moderna trial and I feel Moderna is the best vaccine of all time, and Pfizer is right with Moderna.
1/1	I'm in the same boat as you. But im not selfish so I'm going to trust the experts on this one so I may not spread this virus.
1/1	I'm in the stats finally! Got my first shot of Pzifer yesterday. Really sore arm which is already better.
1/0	I'm interested in seeing the followup on your second dose. The second dose gave me all the side effects! Would still do it again tho 10/10!
1/1	I'm israeli, and 16 yo, I got the vaccine two days ago, I'm feeling great.
1/1	I'm jealous at how the vaccine rollout in the US has been. In India we're still at 53m doses for a 1.3 billion population with the main focus of political parties being some state elections.
1/1	I'm just gonna get it and not talk about it. I'm not sure why we have to constantly talk about it.
1/-1	I'm just here to learn from all the internet WebMD experts
0/0/0	I'm just here to watch my enemies poison themselves. Carry on.
0/0/0/0/-1	I'm just not sure I'll feel comfortable getting the first wave of a vaccine developed this quickly.
1/1	I'm just saying, if it was a 1 in 100 chance of dying from covid or a 1 in a million chance of getting a side effect from the vaccine, the math would strongly support taking the vaccine
1/1	I'm just so glad that back in the 1950s my mother and 99.9% of her peers followed medical advice and vaccinated us kids rather than thinking they knew better. I could have been dead from smallpox by now if my mother had only had a "friend" who knew so much more than her doctor.
0/0	I'm just waiting for this to turn into a Zombie apocalypse.
1/1	I'm just waiting, waiting for that anti-coronavirus vaccine movement to come about in reaction to it finally becoming available for average people.
1	I'm just worried about the additives, other than that, the vaccine seems very clever and sound.
0/0	I'm just worried about the long term effects
1/1	I'm legit allergic to vaccines. So thanks to the rest of yall for keeping us out of the cross fire.
1/1	I'm looking forward to finding out how the Moderna vaccine does. It was the only vaccine in my area. My husband who is a healthcare worker got the Phizer vaccine at work so that makes me feel better for him. I assume Moderna will be similar as they are both mRNA
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting my Covid vaccine next week. I'll happily wear a mask and social distance until we reach herd immunity.
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting my vaccination as soon as possible.
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting the COVID-19 vaccine too I have asthma, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure. I have a flu shot ever year I'm also in my mid 60's
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting the mRNA vaccine!
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting vaccinated in hopefully a few months time. The more antivaxers that refuse to take it, the faster the roll out to everyone else.
0/0	I'm low risk, physically and mentally fit. Someone else can have my doses.
0/0	I'm low risk. physically and mentally fit. Someone else can have my doses.
0/0	I'm more afraid of the vaccine than the covid itself.
1/1	I'm more scared of covid than of any potential vaccine side effects!
0/0	I'm more than willing to wear the mask. year round, but not your VACCINE! I'M A OKAY!
0/0	I'm never getting this vaccine.
0/0	I'm never getting vaccinated Dont trust the government look how there running this country it's a joke and they call them self leaders.
0/0	I'm never taking the vaccine. Your body, your choice people.
0/0	I'm no anti-vaxer, but it's probably safer to take the vaccine after a while, let others go first and see if the vaccine is safe or not. The vaccine seems to be quite rushed, I'll be waiting until its proven safe.
0/0	I'm normal now.. I won't be having any expermenat DNA altering jab.
0/0	I'm not "one of those" types but these "see it's safe!" videos are so unbearable... We literally have zero idea what they're actually being injected with.
0/0	I'm not Anti-Vax but I do not trust this vaccine and would prefer to wait a few before taking it. I don't trust this vaccine at all.
0/0	I'm not a fan of vaccines in general, don't get the flu shot and don't plan on receiving any COVID-19 vaccine. Especially after viewing the video interview with Jorge Araujo, former Merck chemist
0/0	I'm not a lab rat.. I will wait till the current rats have thinned out or not. So far plenty are dropping down.
0	I'm not a lab rat.. I will wait till the current rats have thinned out or not. So far plenty are dropping down. (y) great stuff. If 1 death out of 10.000 infected is enough to stop the world, wouldn't 1 death out of 10.000 vaccinated be enough to stop the program? Guess not..
1/1	I'm not a risk patient for the flu, but I still get my flu shot because having the flu, even if I have a fairly good immunity, sucks cock and I hate it.
1/1	I'm not afraid at all since I'm vaccinated. I'm being cautious because I don't want to be an asymptomatic spreader. I think it's great that people are being considerate.
1/-1	I'm not afraid of COVID. I am more worried about going crazy and losing my from being in quarantine and not able to go anywhere!
0/0	I'm not against the vaccine for those who believe in them.. but for me it's a big No.
1/1	I'm not against vaccine.
0/0	I'm not against vaccines, but the mRNA vaccines have only had very limited testing, and if excess respiratory deaths are within normal for the year, there simply is no health emergency to justify mass vaccination with an experimental drug.
0/0	I'm not an anti vaxxer, but I do have reservations about being injected with something that's been quite rushed.
1/0	I'm not an anti-vaccer, but this would be the thin end of a VERY suspicious wedge. If only because there's a big difference between being anti-vaccine in general and being suspicious of a new vaccine like this one. Even in a pandemic, people are entitled to their opinions in any country that claims to be free and democratic. If this move is successful, then I do NOT believe any promises that the vaccine won't become compulsory. The thing is - there is a partial answer to the problem. In my experience, any inaccurate information coming from opinionated individuals is dwarfed by the rubbish being put out by bots and trolls which to date are hardly controlled at all - and that covers all sorts of areas, not just covid. Do something about the trolls and imho 90% of the disinformation will vanish. But banning opinion? Just plain dangerous.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vax person. I'm also not an anti-common sense person! I'm concerned about the way that these vaccines were rushed to market in less than a year. The vaccine approval process usually takes 5-15 years! I'll wait & see.
0/-1	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but I am nervous about this current covid-19 vaccine can someone please tell me more facts about it
0/0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12 months is giving me doubts.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts
0/0	I'm not anti vax I'm anti this vax and the way its being forcibly implemented.
0/0	I'm not anti vax, I'm just waiting for the 3 year human trial period to be complete before making an assessment. With 2 of the 3 vaccines now "on pause" or outright banned because of complications, and none of them seeming to slow the spread, I think I'm making the right choice.
1/-1	I'm not anti vax, but I'd like to wait just a bit to see more data on which vaccine is best and maybe see more availability of types of vaccines. I'm in no rush, in this rural area.
0/0/0	I'm not anti vax. I get the flue vaccine every year, but I just don't trust two things about the new COVID Vaccines. 1. I don't have trust in the long term safety of the new mRna vaccines. 2. The speed they were developed doesn't inspire confidence in their safety. I will probably wait until the Novavax or the GSK vaccines are approved since they use traditional methodology in their production.
0/0	I'm not anti-vac but I'm not taking a vaccine with 99.7% survival rate while also the fact I probably already had the virus
0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, I'm anti-this vaccine.
0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, just anti THIS vaccine that has been rushed and not tested properly
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, just anti THIS vaccine that has been rushed and not tested properly. For all we know it might be a polio 2.0
0	I'm not anti-vax, I'm anti-ruining my health for sure just because of a chance of getting something else ruining my health. And I've had the flu. It was bad. But that is the chance I have to take so I'm not crippled with disabling arthritis and severe plaque psoriasis all over my body instead of just my scalp
0/0	I'm not anti-vax, I'm just anti-covid vax.
0/1	I'm not antivax but I'm concerned about ingredients as I am in everything I put in my body. Because in the past they say oh this ingredient is safe and then years later, oh this product causes cancer and if you or a loved one have been hurt by one you may be compensated.
1/1	I'm not confused. We are in a race to vaccinate before variants dim the effectiveness. We are also in a race to get people to continue mitigation efforts as more than 25 states are showing an increase in infections. If we want a return to some normalcy this summer we must hold the line.
0/0	I'm not getting a vaccine cuz my body my choice
0/0	I'm not getting it because my mom's friend had half her face drop down and go dumb! Wanna explain that? That happened after she took it!

0/0	I'm not getting it. It's just another type of flu shot, I need more study on it. Also what if it has a tracking cell. Its turning into Hunger Games
0/0	I'm not getting that I will continue to quarantine in my comfortable home with Amazon Prime and Amazon Fresh thank you
0/0	I'm not getting the vaccine because it's dangerous. There have been many major side effects including two deaths from heart attacks. The heart attacks were two hour after the vaccine was given
0/0	I'm not getting the vaccine unless it comes with $10 million in cash up front.
0/0	I'm not getting the vaccine. If I get it, I get it. I work at a hospital and the only people I've ever seen hospitalized with it are the morbidly obese or people with lung cancer or some shit like that. I've had a ton of people I know get it and they were all fine. I've also been hanging out with people the whole way through this pandemic. The only part that actually changed my life is that I didn't go to bars, and found that if I did my drinking at home with people I actually liked then I saved a ton of money. So I say go back to normal and let me see some live music again and if I catch it and die then that's on me.

0/0	I'm not having mine either. And not buying anything they push via their MSM. It's all propaganda!
1/1	I'm not hesitating - I just can't get it. I'm in FL and getting a vaccination here is harder than hitting the Lotto. Trying to sign up on line is a nightmare and there is no solution in sight.
1/1	I'm not in a hurry to take it, but I'll take it.
0/0	I'm not interested in how you feel now, I'm interested in how you are after 2-10 years with the vaccine in your body
0/0	I'm not keen on having the live virus injected into this marvelous work of creation
0/0	I'm not putting a disease in my body period! people do your research on all of side effects and look hard! make your choice.
0/0	I'm not putting a experimental vaccine in me
0/0	I'm not sure about getting old if this is how the world treats old people
1/1	I'm not sure it's possible to change the minds of those who are extremely skeptical of the vaccine at this point. Perhaps Mississippi should focus on getting a high ratio of younger, potentially more open-minded people to get the vaccine, instead of spending time trying to convince older individuals that the vaccine's benefits outweigh the risks. This strategy will indirectly benefit those skeptical older individuals by significantly slowing the spread of the virus in both young and old people. This rationale made me rush to get the vaccine as soon as I could: While I can't convince some of my older relatives to get the vaccine, I can at least make sure I'm vaccinated and therefore they won't get COVID from me
0/0/0	I'm not takin no vaccine shot especially from a mf I buy lotion from
0/0	I'm not taking any emergency released vaccinations!!!!

0/0	I'm not taking it I'm good to each his own these vaccines are not guaranteeing anything as you will see because cases are rising as we speak no vaccine for me
0/0/0	I'm not taking it either...nor are anyone I know and love. And no amount of shaming or explanations will change that. And for the record ...all i know have Masters degrees. Again its based on individual choice.

0/0	I'm not taking it!
0/0	I'm not taking it.
0/0	I'm not taking it. I'm not taking it. I'm not taking it. The d/r of Covid-19 is 1/4 of the flu. It is a common cold. That's all. Real d/r is only 0.037%. It's the biggest HOAX in world history, and 90% of Americans have fallen for it.
0/0	I'm not taking it. Vaccines are just Big Bucks for Big Pharma and doctors.

0/0	I'm not too sure anymore if I will get the vaccine. I don't want to be the one who will give them the datas..
1/1	I'm not too worried about side effects. Even if some number of random people are dropping dead from the vaccine, odds are low anything will happen to me.
0/0/0/0	I'm not willing to have those side effects!
0/0	I'm not willing to take something that has not been tested for side effects in people with cancer HIV and pneumonia COPD or other health issues for that matter, this is a vaccine that is rushed and I do not trust it how do we get a pandemic and a vaccine is made quickly mean while we have children and others dying of cancer 4 more then a hundred years and still can't find a vaccine or a cure kind of makes me sick
0/0	I'm nothing like an anti-vaxxer! I just think that all the experts are wrong, this "treatment" is a danger to children and must be banned, all the experts are probably in on a big conspiracy, they've not tested it for long enough anyway, have you read this blog?
1/1	I'm on dose 1 of 2 for the astra zeneca and would definitely do it again in a heart beat. Little bit of soreness (my butt literally hurt the next day). But other than that it is a nice feeling to be walking around with a little protection on board. Won't change my behavior in terms of PPE of course, but it's nice to have a slight change of mindset. Would recommend.
1/-1	I'm on the ledge with trusting it. They should show that it's safe.
1	I'm one of the lucky few. Next week will be my 2nd week after my 2nd dose! Sad part is where I live, hardly anyone is getting vaccinated. Hardcore trumpland.
1/1	I'm one of the ones in the top priority to get the vaccine when it's available
0/0	I'm one that Will not get it I will take my chances God in in my heart he will be with me all the way through
0/1	I'm one.\nGot the mumps vaccine when it was introduced had the mumps 6 months later
1/1	I'm part of one of the trial groups. Heading to the right direction for everyone! It'll be a few months but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
1/1	I'm partially vaccinated, getting my 2nd one in a few weeks. It was really cool to experience the vaccine clinic, definitely felt Iike history in the making.
0/0/0	I'm perfectly healthy. But i'm forced to get the vaccine. Now I am infected! Are we living in an idiot world?
1/1	I'm personally glad there are people who don't want the vaccine. That increases the chances for those of us who want it to get it.
1/1/1	I'm planning getting vaccinated for Covid, but can you take benadryl aftermath?
1/1	I'm pleased to note how many people are NOW saying they'll have the vaccine when its offered
1/1	I'm portuguese and almost everyone I know wants to be vaccinated, that is correct, but many of them are now afraid to get Astrazeneca's vaccine specifically to the point some say they will refuse it or want another vaccine because of the controversy.
1/1	I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
0/0	I'm pretty relaxed about this; as an under-50 year old in the private sector with with no underlying health conditions, by the time the NHS gets round to even offering me a vaccine, there will be over a year (probably longer) of real world testing on healthcare workers, the elderly and infirm. If there are unwanted side effects I'll know all about them long before I have to make a choice about getting the vaccine.
0/0	I'm pretty sure vaccine isn't the correct term, its actually gene therapy
0/0	I'm pretty sure vaccine isn't the correct term, its actually gene therapy.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine and every covid safe measure. But this is a unique virus and set of circumstances Australia finds itself in. I just hope we don't inadvertently makes things worse here, because compared to the rest of the world, we are doing very well
1/1	I'm pro vaccine because Covid is high risk for some ( likely much higher than vaccine) but I don't pretend to know something that can't possibly be proven at this point
1/1	I'm pro vaccine but I would never "punish" someone for decisions others make about their own bodies.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine but I wouldn't force it on people, it should remain an individual choice.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine, I hope as many people as possible get vaccinated, but it's a particularly British thing that the more we're told we must do something the more resistance we put up.
0/0	I'm pro vaccine, but not when it comes to experimental vaccines like these.
1/1	I'm pro vaccines, and I will most likely get an eventual Covid vaccine eventually. That said it's naive to think that it will be 100% safe. The swineflu vaccine which was also rushed, caused an outbreak of narcolepsy and some other things were rumored but not proven as far as I recall
1/1	I'm pro vax, I have had a flu jab every year. As part of duty of care in my job, I don't mind. My choice. I'm also pro choice, if you don't want it. No way should you have it. But don't call me stupid, if I don't agree with your choice.. Its my choice..
1/1	I'm probably not in the risk group (hashimoto's) but I will get it as soon as it's made available to me.
0/1	I'm quitting my job if they require me to take it.
1/1/1/1	I'm ready for my turn.
1/1	I'm ready for the pandemic to be over.
1/1	I'm ready to be injected now!
0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine
0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine. This goes way way deeper than most people would ever think possible.
1/1	I'm ready...... let's get this party started
1/1/1/1/1	I'm really glad that you had the opportunity to get your shots!!
1/1	I'm really proud of how stuff like this gets explained my Mike and other experts, talking about international effort, more details about the mRNA vaccines really shined some light to me what we really accomplished and what we still can accomplish as a society if we just dedicate ourselves to it! Much love to anyone who reads this and stay strong we'll get through this!
0/0	I'm refusing the vax.
0/0	I'm running a vaccine trial with myself as the guinea-pig .... Good food, vitamin D, sleep and social distancing. So far it's 100% effective.
0/0	I'm scared from the possible long term side effects
0/0	I'm scared of the sideeffects
1/1/1/1/1/1	I'm scheduled to be vaccinated on thursday. I work in a covid unit and see the devastation of this virus, so I'm really excited it's finally here. I've been keeping up with the science because, like anyone, I don't want to roll up my sleeve to something that isn't safe. I feel confident in this vaccine. mRNA vaccines have been studied for over a decade. The reason this one was developed quickly is because the whole world was throwing money at this project. It's amazing what can be accomplished with such a huge collective effort. Roll up those sleeves, America. Let's save a life and get back to something more normal.
1/1	I'm scheduled to get 1st dose this week. Pfizer vaccine.
0/1	I'm scheduled to get the vaccine. What are so many people afraid of? There's going to be an occasional allergic response. No one has died from it. Don't complain about wearing masks, businesses being shut down, unemployment if your not willing to be part of the solution.
0/0	I'm seriously asking. not attempting to be an a$$hole. But why did you get it in the first place? Again. this question is sincere. Thanks
1/1	I'm shocked of the people in this world, there is so many who belive in lies. This is a normal vaccine as all the others out there are
1/1	I'm signed up for my first vaccine dose on Monday (I work at the hospital) and I was a little nervous. I feel a lot more prepared now!
1/1	I'm so envious that you have the COVID Vaccine! Here in Australia we haven't gained access to it yet, here's hoping it is soon
1/1	I'm so envious that you have the COVID Vaccine! Here in Australia we haven't gained access to it yet, here's hoping it is soon! I hope you stay healthy and well, happy new year!
1/1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now.
1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now. This is fantastic news! Merry Christmas everyone!
1/1	I'm so getting a happy ending with mine.
1/1	I'm so glad my mom wasn't huge on the internet when I was a baby, she told me the other day "if I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have vaccinated you" and I just stared at her for a couple seconds
1/1	I'm so glad you all could get vaccinated and that it's providing such good protection vs. COVID.
1	I'm so happy - my mother-in-law in LTC received her first vaccine shot yesterday. You have no idea what a relief it is, we've been petrified for almost a year. Every phone call would send the heart racing.
0/0	I'm so happy that my grandparents don't wanna take it. BIG NO.!
1/0	I'm so happy to know all the many conspiracy theories about the vaccine. Yay!
1/1	I'm so happy, I love seeing people say yes to science
1/1	I'm so proud to be a part of this trial! üí™üèº How wonderful to hopefully have another vaccine rolling out soon!
0/0	I'm so scared. My dad was just brought to the hospital after having the 2nd shot. He couldn't breath and he was very confused. Im so scared he is going to die.
0/0	I'm so sketchy on this vaccine.. My moms uncle apparently got vaccinated and was found dead a couple days later from a "fall". He was perfectly healthy and had zero troubles walking. Idk man
0/0/0/0	I'm so sorry for the families shattered by vaccine injuries. Thank you to these families who share their heartbreaks. You are saving so many lives!!!! Please people wake up.
1/1	I'm so thankful my daughter in law. Vaccinats my grandchildren!
1/1	I'm sold. Where do I get this Johnson & Johnson vaccine? Can't find it anywhere.
1/1	I'm soooo looking forward to my vaccination in a few months!
0/0	I'm sorry POTUS fell for this, it looks like pure welfare for big pharma. There is NO way they could suddenly come up with a Corona virus vaccine in months when they've tried unsuccessfully for decades. I think it's a scam.
0/0	I'm sorry he can let us know in a few years time . No way am I having it done . How many times have they come out with a vaccine, for it to have enormous side effects.
1/-1	I'm sorry to be critical but I don't think the J&J vaccine is a good idea in places where the mRNA vaccines are an option. Preventing serious illness is all well and good for the vaccinated person, but if you're still able to become infected and transmit the virus, then everyone else around you continues to be borked. Better to have the vaccine that appears to prevent infection and transmission than the one that saves just the transmitter from serious symptoms.
1/1	I'm sorry what? I've done the research on the vaccine, and how it works. I know EXACTLY how it works, from knowing the sequence of the amino acids to have it produces the spike proteins (sorry for all the complicated words, your 1st grade vocabulary and knowledge must be having trouble understanding). I have concluded that there is no way that the vaccine is harmful IN ANY way.
1/1	I'm sorry! I got my second shot yesterday too, and am super achy, but other than that I'm good. So far. Glad to be protected, but side effects aren't fun.
1/1	I'm still alive and haven't became a 5g transmitter beacon so I guess that's a good thing...
0/0	I'm still not getting it.
0/0	I'm still not taking it and I don't care what clergy member does it's not going to change my mind.
0/1	I'm still not taking that vaccine don't trust it
0/1	I'm still very happy with my decision to get vaccinated, and I was lucky to get it back in January through my job. I can see why people would be hesitant but just do your research and do what's best for you.
1/1	I'm super curious to see how people respond to it, especially folks who have autoimmune conditions but aren't immunocompromised. (Context: I fall in that camp myself and have pretty stressful reactions to vaccines usually so I tend to only get certain ones. For folks like me, it'll be helpful to see how it seems to go for other atypical folks.)
0/0	I'm sure somebody has probably already posted a comment like this BUT.....if these vaccinations work so well, wtf are the people that have said vaccines worrying about the anti-vax crowd for?
0/0	I'm sure that Putin will offer the vaccine to all of his political opponents free of charge.
1/1	I'm sure that will be the only one my insurance will cover...
0/0	I'm sure there will be a many more vaccine horror stories.
0/0/0/0	I'm sure this has made anyone who doesn't want to get the vaccine, now beating down the doors to be 1st in line. made me not want it even more
0/-1	I'm surprised YouTube allowed this video, oh its bs no wonder
0/0	I'm surprised they want everyone protected but not out of poverty, if you are such a kind heart share your wealth with us first then we will have fate in your vaccine that you so generously want to share; we don't trust this thing you want every one to have so badly
0/0	I'm taking God's medicine because his word is health to all our flesh ..... all our flesh !
1/1	I'm taking it
1/1	I'm taking mine tomorrow! Pumped!!!
1/1	I'm taking my responsibility and getting my shots.
1/1	I'm taking my vaccine today and I couldn't be happier.
1/1	I'm tearing up that this is finally coming. It's been such a tough last 9 months here in the rural midwest where the majority of people don't take things seriously and then people die. Hopefully this is a sign that we're almost at the end.
0/0	I'm too allergic to medications and vaccines. I'm not afraid of getting Covid and won't be getting it. My surgeon who was doing my foot surgery had his second dose and had to be hospitalized. Nope
0/0	I'm trying to get medical treatment in the Philadelphia area and they refuse to treat me until I take the vaccine I told them forget it then
1/1	I'm unaware of any anti vaxxers I know IRL, I am however aware of people who do not want to get the covid vaccine, though I think they have been coming around on it lately.
1/1	I'm vaxxed and past the two weeks since my last shot. I'ma eat out now.
1/1	I'm very pro-vaccine and fully align with your risk-benefit analysis.
1/1/1/1	I'm very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used
1/1/1	I'm very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used, but I don't get this argument.
0/-1	I'm very skeptical in taking this vaccine my choice my decision.
1/1	I'm waiting my turn with optimism.
1/-1	I'm waiting until I can get the Pfizer vaccine and when I can get the second dose within the effectiveness window.
0/0	I'm well and truly in the 1b catergory with underlying conditions but after a great deal of thought, I have no faith in the #AstraZenaca vaccine. With an appt to get the jab I am strongly veering away from proceeding. Should I go ahead or take my chances? Whaddaya reckon?
0/0	I'm willing to donate my dose since I won't be using it.
0/0	I'm with the anti Vax
0/0	I'm with you!! I'm not getting it either.
0/0	I'm with you. Somebody else can have mine.
0/0	I'm woke, I refuse the vaccine.
1	I'm working on the shot!
0/0	I'm writing today also, but with this: Covid 19 vaccines are, by their own description, experimental. They are intended for the whole planet. Experiments go right, experiments go wrong. If this goes wrong, it wipes out the human race. How can any reasonable person support that?
1/1	I'm young and just got my second shot last friday. Within the day my arm got a little sore (curiously not as sore as the first). On Saturday I developed a fever that peaked at 101.4, and then broke before dinner. Overall I got mild sickness for about 7 hours and then felt normal again and was running/doing cardio by the next day. So don't fear the shot, because even if you do get a fever, it may not even last more than a few hours.
0/0	I'm young, healthy, don't ever get sick and have never had a flu or any kind of virus other than the odd stomach bug.
1/1/1	I'ma take it
1/-1	I've already had it months ago...So, I think I will sit this argument out.,
0/0/1	I've already taken my shots but people apparently are still getting covid in spite of their shots the cases on the rise concerning this in Florida.
1/1/1/1	I've been fully vaccinated for over a month. Felt a little tired after the shots, but other than that, no problems.
0/0	I've been hearing about too many people dying just days after taking the vaccine. Plus they came out with it way too quick.
1/1	I've been looking in the internet and I'm willing to take it as long as it isn't anything bad like the mark of the beast, and/or mixes my dna. Not sure but if one of those is true I'm really scared.
0/0	I've been mask free this whole time. I've even processed thousands of recycled can's and bottles from a hotel chain. No mask. No probs. This whole thing is phaaake!
1/1	I've been saying this for months. There's likely a bias in all these polls that leads to anti-vaxxers being more likely to respond to them.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I've been surrounded by people with Covid & I have not yet got it. Meaning I'm immune... Why the hell would I want this type of vaccine.
1/1	I've been waiting for this kind of video. I'm tired of fakenews and rumors about covid19 vaccines. I tried to explain the differences between mRNA and virusvector type...now I'll just show this video. Thanks.
1/1/1/1	I've completed the vaccines, so far no major side effect except for a mild fever and bodyache. Just get vaccinated guys
1/1	I've given getting the vaccine a lot of thought and I have done some research on the potential side effects. After weighing it all out in my head I have come to the conclusion that getting the vaccine outweighs the risk of going un- vaccinated. Yes there has to some people who have had adverse reactions to the vaccines but that risk is small compared to what COVID-19 will do to me. The lasting complications even if you recover from the virus is something that I don't want to live with. So while I might not feel completely safe getting vaccinated I still think it's a better alternative than getting infected with COVID-19 and im ready to get vaccinated now.
0/0	I've got a question. Couldn't there be side effects that only appear in a few years? That's the only thing I'm sceptical about, but I'm no expert and I'd love to see an explanation to how safe it is and how you can guarantee me that I won't have some weird disease in a few years
1/1	I've gotten the Moderna vaccine, I had very mild side effects, even more mild than my normal Influenza vaccine. I go back for my second dose on the 8th of February!
1/1	I've gotten the first one & have an appointment for the second on 2/19. No reaction except a slight headache to the first shot. I can't imagine not getting a vaccine against a lethal virus by which 473,182 people in the US have died in 11 months. None of them expected death
1	I've had COVID. 13 months ago. Fully vaccinated with Pfizer. Feel better now than I have in a year
1/1	I've had Johnson and Johnson 6 weeks out and no problem
1/1	I've had astra zeneca and im fine
1/1	I've had both my vaccinations. No effects after 1st one. Fatigued for a day or 2 after the 2nd with a mild headache. My dad died from covid last November. He died fighting for his breath in hospital. The vaccine came too late for him. I cannot understand anyone refusing.
1/1	I've had both of my vaccines and I really didn't have much of a reaction at all. Sore arm with the first shot and maybe a little tired with the second...that's it.
1/-1	I've had mine and been fine.
1/1	I've had my 1st jab the side effects are horrible, feelings of happiness, getting my life back, the country at last coming out of this dark shadow hanging over it to name a few can't wait to get my 2nd might even go on holiday again and smile
1	I've had my first one today, no side effects so far lets face it, there is side effects to a lot of medications/vaccines. It has to be worth it if it gets rid of this Covid!
1/-1	I've had my first vaccine and was more than happy to do so but certainly wouldn't feel comfortable mixing them.
1/1	I've had my vaccine.. thank fuk..
1/1	I've had so many dreams in the past few months of getting a shot, and they were as uplifiting of a dream as I can imagine. Got my first one today and it wasn't quite as magical with confetti flying out of the air and all, it was still quite special.
1/1	I've had the astrazeneca vaccine and no noticeable effects at all
1/1	I've had the pfiza vaccine. It gave me a dead arm feeling for a few days but apart from that I have had no problems.
1/1	I've had the two Pfizer shots and had no reaction except a slightly sore arm.
0/1	I've heard all kinds of things. It can give you aids. It's made with animal genetics and can change your dna and make you animal like. The government is just putting microchips in you. And the people who told me this 100% believe this and have read this online from people who have "researched" this and are "reputable".
1/1	I've heard it makes your male bits bigger and takes ten years off your face. Pass it on.
1/1	I've just booked my COVID vaccine
1/0	I've just had a terrible side effect to the #OxfordVaccine #CovidVaccine I've come out with a degree!
0/1	I've just had my 2nd dose of the vaccine today at lunchtime unexpectedly, extra clinic put on as more Pfizer available to health care staff. Absolutely ecstatic to have had it. Again absolute no pain and feel fantastic x
1/-1	I've just missed going outside and see people in peace
1/1	I've learned that in that thing I went for a while. The school.... I had pretty strong side effects after Zeneca vaccine. Two days of fever, headache and pain in the arm. But that's perfectly normal. I know that my immune system kicked in.

0/0	I've never been against vaccinations in my life but I'm not trusting anything that's been rushed to production; especially not if it's coming out of Russia, China or the US
0/0/0/0	I've never been against vaccinations in my life but I'm not trusting anything that's been rushed to production; especially not if it's coming out of Russia, China or the US.
0/0	I've never ever had a flu shot and my last vaccines were in 1965. I have many allergies and I can't eat processed food. It makes me sick physically. There are to many questions and not enough proof that they are Safe.

0/0	I've never gotten any flu shots. For the past decade, never down with flu too. I grow my own herbs and I work from home. Do u want me to convince u to get ur own garden too? It has far better benefits (including anti cancer, blood cleansing, anti clotting properties etc) than a man made vaccine.
1/1	I've never had issues/bad side effects from vaccines so I've got no reason not to. Just like I've had the flu shot every year of my working life (because working in courthouses is pretty high risk for flu).
0/-1	I've never heard of anyone getting any adverse side effects let alone death from therapeutic levels of Vitamins D3, C, Zinc and Selinium.
0/0	I've never wanted a gun but I'm getting one now .They aren't getting my family with thier disgusting poison
1/1	I've now had both...the second one today, and yes, I'd say the vaccine I had has so far been both safe and effective. Honestly, I'ved never felt better.
1/1	I've read the info and believe in science, and I believed these vaccines were safe and effective basically for a while now. But this news... As someone who's parents are very high risk, it really confirms it for me. It gives me so much hope that they'll be safe once they receive their two doses. I feel more relief now than I did when I received my own doses.
1/1	I've received both shots of the vaccine from Moderna because of my first responder job. I can tell you from my experience that everyone's reaction to the vaccine will differ from person to person. The first shot only gave me a sore shoulder for about a day or so. The second shot I got I ended up getting a mild case of the flu. But some of my co-workers had gotten worst reactions from the first shot and mild reactions from the second shot.
0/0	I've reported this as terrorism. Government using the threat of violence to create fear.
0/0/0	I've researched plenty, and I won't be taking the experimental vax.
0/0	I've said America is doomed. America will never be the same again. Millions have been sold out. Biden will push trumps vax on everyone
1/0	I've said some things on YouTube that I've come to regret to be honest I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them and if they don't believe in vaccines that's fine everyone is entitled to their own
1/1	I've said some things on YouTube that I've come to regret to be honest I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them and if they don't believe in vaccines that's fine everyone is entitled to their own opinion so in my opinion people shouldn't be forced to get the coronavirus vaccine
0/0/0	I've seen enough. It's a strong no for me. If you still think it's safe, please search a bit more, you clearly still have no idea..
1/1	I've seen old, terminally ill people get the covid vaccine and not have any symptoms besides a sore arm. I, for one, am not worried.
1/1	I've seen so much vaccine disinformation, it really sucks. I got the J&J vaccine and had no side effects whatsoever.
0/0	I've served in the US army 12 years and won't take that vaccine if it costs me my military career
1/-1	I've spoken to perhaps a dozen people who've had the jab. None have told me which one they had and none of them have commented on any side effects other than a sore arm.
1/1	I've subbed buddy, great video. How to drill this into the anti vaxxers is the next step!! Informative, amusing and well presented.
0/0	I've survived 10 months of being exposed to 10,000 people a day. I have no need for a vaccine now. You can keep it. as for employer mandates...not a difficult decision - employers are replaceable, my life is not.
1/1	I've taken the vaccine shots. So far no problems. I took it because I have personally known two people that have died from covid
1/1	I've wondered if those who had Covid should get the vaccine. I want to get mine ASAP. Data from SARS COV1 shows immunity 17 years after infection.
0/0	I've yet to heard any good reasons to get it. My old granny who is 84 and said it was like a mild cold. Why would anyone healthy get it? Apparently you can still catch after you get vaccine? It is "safe" this is coming from the guys who shamed everyone not to wear masks then flipped flopped a few weeks later. Did everyone forget that? I thought well if doctors are wearing them wouldn't they work for the average joe? Now they want us to wear two masks lol. On the CDC website it says you have to spend 15 minutes in front of someone to catch it and to stay six feet apart unless you walk into a school than three feet is fine. Maybe people don't want to get the vaccine is because it seems like the "experts" really don't know what they are talking about. Not even mentioning some vaccines are only 79% effective for a virus that has a 99.7 survival rate and a FEW people have gotten really sick or even died from them. I think I'll take my chances.
0/0	I, a New York citizen, Stand in total agreement with the Californians! üíØ% No poison for me! üôÖüèæ‚ôÄ
1/1	I, along with many of my work colleagues working on the AstraZeneca vaccine, received my first dose of the COVID inoculation. It was a wonderful
1/1	I, and others, know that vaccination will be the only way to save ourselves and our loved ones. Only damned fools deny it.
0/0	I, nor my family will take the Covid shot--ever!
0/0	I, too, am a registered nurse who has done extensive reading and will not be getting the vaccine.
1/-1	I,ll take my chances with the vax ,thank.
1/0	I,m just worried if its safe or not. They keep saying it is, but how do they know not being anywhere near the TWO YEARS it usually takes to get a vaccine. Short cuts are needed for under TWO years, I will be happy to take it Sept 2022 subject to those taking it now still being functional & producing normal children.
1/1	I- Wow the comments! Seriously I'm actually writing a paper debunking anti-vaxxers, any and all anti-vaxxers please give me REAL reasons why they are so bad
1/0	I? okay. I felt awful last night
0/0	I? tired of people telling others to get the vaccine. Mind your own business!

1/0	Idk. Some people didn‚Äôt want it I know that much. If was allowed to I woulda got it.
0/0	If 87000 Dutch nurses refuse to take the vaccine, because they do not want to be guinea pigs, why should you take it?
1/1	If AIDS spreads quicker like this, you guys will also have a vaccine of it in a year I bet.
1/1	If BBC says it's safe then it is! Every one please listen to them . They care so much about us. Thank you BBC ‚ù§
0	If Bill Gates gave me all his entire wealth to take one of his depopulation shots, I would still vehemently decline. Forever. I can not be bought.
1/0	If COVID was like the flu i wouldn‚Äôt even bother to get the vaccine but this shit different.

1/1	If I can dumb it down that much, I don‚Äôt know why people have to be so scared of it.
1/1/1	If I can get a one shot in any of the months in spring, I will be more then pleased
1/1/1	If I can get my life back that‚Äôs fine with me. Had the first jab already. Bring it on !
1/1	If I can't get the virus, I can't spread it that's why I want to be immune.
0/0	If I can't hold someone accountable for a product that can hurt me then I don't have to take it period dot.
0/0	If I can't sue the company, that's a rap itself.
1/1	If I could get the first vaccines I would. I caught the virus, and spent 9 days in the hospital. Would be nice if you had a section here, talking about what goes wrong if the vaccine is not safe. Pretty sure these 2 vaccines will get approved by FDA.
1/1/1/1	If I could, I would have taken the phase 3 trials. I'd be the first in whatever line for the vaccine.
0/-1	If I don‚Äôt take the vaccine, it doesn‚Äôt effect you. I can still transmit covid with the shot, so why does it matter to everyone that I get something that doesn‚Äôt even do it‚Äôs job.
1/0	If I go outside I will get autism so I don't do it
1/1	If I had parents at a nursing home and a nursing home worker working there refused vaccination I would want the nursing home to let that employee go immediately.
1/1	If I had to choose between being vaccinated or the possibility of getting the virus, then I choose vaccination!
1/0	If I have any people on my list that refuse to take the vaccine please put my name down instead of yours on that appointment. I will sell my soul to the Devil so you don't have to!
1/1	If I have kids when I'm older, and they say that they are against vaccines, I'll tell them about the time we are in right now.
0/0	If I haven't even had the flu in 40 years, and hardly been sick in such a long time, I can't remember when, than why would I want to take a vaccine for covid...that would stupid, my immune system is good enough!!
1/1	If I hear any pharmacy threw out COVID vaccines because Hinshaw said so I am going to lose my goddamn mind.
0/0	If I look up and see vaccine companies STOPPING vaccinations because there is not enough. I will say THAT IS BACKWARDS! If you dont have enough you dont need to stop using the ones you have. Thats a lie. MOST people dont want it! They are closing a lot of centers, this makes the small percent of people that do want it have to wait in LONG LINES.....This increases interest. Just like buying a tickle me elmo, or any other product. To ME they are stopping for one real reason. So they can get as many people to take it at ONCE. No time to have enough people show the results. People are already being silenced. Once they get it down, the left will be next. They can already have 50% of the country tagged as againtst it and censor people in a literal second.
0/0	If I needed a reason not to take the vaccine this was it
1/1/1/1	If I read the research on the vaccine and I thought it was sound, I would take it.
1/1	If I was provided clear facts, I will agree to be vaccinated.
0/0	If I were ever to receive this on live national television, I'd start shaking and fall out of my chair
0/0	If I were you, I'd think before doing something so rash
1/0	If I'm about to be locked in a cell full of other people with coronavirus and not much medical care, then yes, please give me an untested vaccine first.
1/0	If I'm being honest, "vaccine doubters among the staff" of a medical facility kind of terrifies me.
1	If I'm going to get a vaccine, I would prefer one that has the best outcome against COVID.
0/0	If I‚Äôm forced to get a vaccine just kill me because I‚Äôm not getting it.
1/1	If They Are An Intelligent And Rational Person They Will Take It.
0/1	If a 1 in 10^6 probability of dangerous side effects prevents you from taking a vaccine, have I got news about not wearing a mask during an unnecessary trip to the grocery store.
1/1	If a 3rd vacine or annual booster is necessary to get COVID under control, save lives and get life back to normal, I will gladly do it.
0/-1	If a Politian had to choose between one vaccine and one placebo on a table they would walk away.
0/0	If a company has been granted immunity against any lawsuits in the future for any possible long term side effects of the vaccine then eh... count me out!
1/1	If a vaccine becomes available that has passed all clinical trials and has been proven safe and effective, and half the population refuses to take it...that just means my family and I will be able to get ours sooner.
0/0	If a vaccine injuries you or kills you the company who makes that vaccine are not responsible and are not liable. There is no guarantee that you will not get coronavirus or spread it after getting a vaccine
0/0	If a vaccine injuries you or kills you the company who makes that vaccine are not responsible and are not liable. There is no guarantee that you will not get coronavirus or spread it after getting a vaccine. The vaccine is also made with aborted fetal tissue. And for all of these reasons I will never receive a coronavirus vaccine ever.
1/0	If a vaccine works with your immune system, why give it to someone who has a poor immune system, as is being suggested ?
0/0	If a whole country decided to not wear masks. shutdown. lockdown... what percentage of the population do you think would die in a year? If you said 0%. you are correct. Sweden's All death total increased by 6.994 in 2020. Sweden has a population of 10.380.245. That is a 0.06% population hit in 2020... Thank you for ending the ' ' pandemic ' ' with a monumental case study Sweden!
0/0/0/0/0/0	If all the people that want the vaccine take it and they are "safe" then my freedom to deny the vaccine won't hurt you... you're immunized.
0/0	If all the vulnerable are vaccinated, and I being young and healthy are still capable of being infectious even if the vaccine keeps my symptoms down, why do I need vaccinating again?
1/1	If antivaxxers do not take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
1/1/1/1	If antivaxxers don‚Äôt take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
1/1	If any medical personnel feel unsure about getting it, HMU, Ill take your spot!
0/0/0/0	If anybody out there truly cares for there kids please wonder what the hell is in that needle
1/0	If anyone ever took more than 2 seconds to read into the pause of the J&J vaccine, it was only 6 rare cases out of the 6 million doses given. Stop feeding into the antivax agenda
0/0	If anyone in my family is harmed by one of these vaccines Bill Gates and Fauci are going to be the virus that gets eliminated.
1/0	If anyone takes this gene therapy. Then you are absolutely crazy or scared to death because you have watched too much mainstream. Cv19 does not pass koch's postulates therefore never proven to exist. Exosomes are really viruses. The pcr test has been manipulated and can find anything in anybody given enough cycles. Says Kary Mullis the creator... Full armour
0/0	If anyone threatens to harm me or my family and force a vaccine it will be them in a domino crash I'm not even playing. Whoever's behind them is next.
0/-1	If anything happens, the scout corps are ready. Dont worry
0/-1	If by vaccine you mean a rushed chemical that will most likely be even more dangerous than the actual virus.
0/0	If companies who created vaccines dont take liabilities for after effects, why the hell we should take it.
0/0	If covid mutates to that level then the vaccine is stupid anyway since the virus will just mutate and get around the vaccine....
0/0	If distancing worked why masks? If masks worked why distancing? If both worked why lockdowns? If kockdowns worked why vaccines? If vaccines work why vaxx manufacturers are exempt from responsibility?
1/1	If enough people refuse the vaccine so we don't reach herd immunity we're never going to kill this thing, so yeah. You refuse the vaccine, we refuse you entry... simple.
0/0	If enough sheeple get the vaccine then that means I won't have to.
0/0	If everyone around me has had the vaccine they will all be immune, which means I cannot catch the lurgy from them so I won't need to have the vaccine myself √∞≈∏Àú≈†
0/0	If everyone else is getting the shot then I don‚Äôt need it
1/1	If everyone got it, 90% is basically herd immunity anyways. Everyone won't get it, but now people will have a much lower chance of getting it than without. It's better than anything else we've been doing.
1/-1	If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months‚Äîthe fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
0	If i had to choose between covid & the vaccine, covid her I come baby
0/0/0/0/0	If immunity lasts few months after a covid illness, how do we know that an individual's immunity after this vaccine will sustain longer?
1/1	If injecting it through your dickhole was the only option, I'd still do it. Anything to return to normalcy. Or at least as normal as we can make it again.
1/1	If it 90% effective but they could inject it into my eye id still take it in a heartbeat
1/1	If it comes to my country I will take it gratefully. Without a second thought
1/-1	If it gets bad in the winter, think of it this way: We had a limited time in the summer to rapidly test vaccines using the many many volunteers for human challenge trials, and we squandered it, but at least some counterfactual worlds out there are doing great!
1/1	If it gets the world to near normal what's the issue! I cant wait to get jabbed so I can play my part in helping my industry back to work. Too many good people in the entertainment industry struggling at the moment.
0/0	If it has any aborted fetus tissue at all I'll never touch it regardless of what the pope says. Honestly I'd likely never get it anyway though
1/0	If it is proven that the vaccines safe for me, I'll be first in line
0/0	If it is so "safe and effective" why are so many people getting really bad adverse reactions, and why are so many dying after getting the injections??? Also now, the CDC and WHO have agreed that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are very effective and safe at curing you from Covid-19.
0/0	If it is tested then would you know in the results that it is safe for upcoming generations if it's effect starting after so many years then how we take it safe today.
0/0	If it isn‚Äôt a permanent immunization, then it‚Äôs not a vaccine.
1/1	If it keeps you out of hospital and dying its doing well Better than not any vaccine at all...... Some will always use any news to be negative to forward their own petty agenda It's time for all of us to focus on the positives for society as a whole.
1/1/1	If it makes it past FDA with appropriate screening, proper Phase I/II/III trials/metas, then yes.
1/1	If it makes yall feel better, all the stupid people will get covid and die, so stupidity levels will be lowered...
1/1	If it wasn‚Äôt for the vaccine, I would have been hit hard with Covid! I am glad I have the vaccine!!!
0/0	If it were really so good, at least one developed country would have approved it. Why no approval from US and UK?
0/1	If it will give me my freedom back, I'm all 4 it.
0/0/0	If it worked and was safe, you wouldn‚Äôt need to mandate, force, deceive, or threaten people who question it...
1/1	If it works, who cares where it's from.
0/0	If it's safe, then why can't we sue the manufacturer if we have a severe reaction or vaccine injury
0/0	If it's so safe how come the UK government has had to give Pfizer immunity from being sued, can anyone answer me that, it doesn't look good
0/0	If it's so safe then why does it have a ton of side effects?
0/0	If it's so safe, why does the vaccine injury compensation program exist? Vaccines are poisonous!
1/1	If its proven to be safe and effective YES. We need to keep ourselves and others safe! The anti vaxxers are unscientific and vast majority crazy!
1/1	If it‚Äôs 75% effective in stopping the spread AND you have essentially zero chance of severe covid, it will be very useful.
1/1	If it‚Äôs the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine there‚Äôs absolutely zero possibility they got sick from it. Also, both take two doses given two weeks apart for it to be effective. They got infected from someone, most likely one of the people administering the vaccine or employee of the nursing home.
0/0	If mRNA vaccines are that safe, why did the US Congress pass a law that the companies cannot be sued for any adverse reactions?
0/0	If mandating vaccines was actually about health...Then why not mandate healthy eating? Why not mandate exercise? Because it's not about health. It's about money, power and control by way of forced medical intervention!!!
0/0	If medical professionals don't trust the vaccine why should I trust it?
1/1	If multiple vaccines become available, I wonder if getting all of them over time might increase your immunity over just one.
0/0	If my ancestors never use vaccine why me?
1/0	If my doctor a medical professional that most likely researched the science gets the shot then if you trust your doctor with your health then that is my reason for getting it myself.
0/0/0/0	If my employer requires me to have the shot, I will quit on the spot
0/0	If my job makes me take it , I‚Äôll quit.
0/0	If my job requires me to take this vaccine, I will give up my white collar job to go back to blue collar or independent contractor versus putting my life at risk
0/0	If my life insurance isn‚Äôt going to pay out if this kills me than I‚Äôm not taking it.
1/1	If my nurse was an anti vaxxer, I would rather run out of the hospital than be treated by her
1	If my nurse was an anti vaxxer, I would rather run out of the hospital than be treated by her.
1/1	If not enough people vaccinate, then there doesn't form an immunity for everyone.
0/1	If not, then another booster shot may be necessary.
1/1	If offered take it and save lives and overloading the NHS.
0/-1	If one of the side effects of taking this Vaccine is the increase in the size of your manhood. 90% of men and 20% of women would take it. (facts).
1/-1	If only conspiracy theorists were actually open to outside sources. This would be enlightening if they could drop their confirmation bias.
0/0/0	If only everyone will comply and just take the jab, followed by endless booster jabs, than we can have a little normalcy back. Seems obvious the whole world is held hostage by an international cabal pushing their 1 world order.
1/-1	If only people didn't have personal choices, it'd make "health" officials jobs much easier.
1/0	If only people would just learn about science and take some mushrooms maybe they would stop questioning worldwide administrated vaccines.
1/1	If only some people knew the effects of usual drugs we take n we deem safe they would receive the vaccines without making bogus statements when they know nothing to do with effects of drugs they take n think are safe.... Take the vaccines or leave it who loses
1/1	If only they had gotten the opportunity to vaccinate. The Astra vaccine isn‚Äôt perfect but it save lives. So sorry Germany
0/1	If only they would have tested it more... oh wait, real scientists have being say that from day one
0/0/0	If people are ignorant enough to continue taking these poisonous vaccines, they deserve what they get, plain and simple.
1/1	If people dont want the vaccine thats ok , but when they cant travel , go to festivals, eat out etc , tough
1/1/1/1	If people had this same negative energy around the corinvirunus vaccine, with all the other past vaccines. We'd all be dead.
0/0	If people in the health care field have reservations about this vaccine, that's all I need to know. I'd rather take my chances with a virus that has an over 99% survival rate.
1/1/1	If people would just take a totally safe vaccine then we would be so much safer
1	If putins letting his family get a vaccine then it must be safe
1/1	If sky say that the vaccine is safe..then I guess it must be.
1/-1	If someone claims the covid vaccines are gene therapy, they simply don't know what they are talking about and you need read no further. The definition of gene gene therapy is "the introduction of normal genes into cells in place of missing or defective ones in order to correct genetic disorders." the vaccines do not introduce genes to replace missing or defective genes, the introduced genes code for the covid virus spike protein and it is not introduced to correct a genetic disorder, Fulfill
0/0	If someone dies from taking the vaccine they will blame in on covit 19
0/0	If someone dies from the jab is it considered a covid 19 death? Or are you guys going to blame it on a new variant.
0/0	If someone said "Take this, we weren't allowed to use it before and don't know the long term side effects and it we are still seeing if it works and oh, the manufacturers are protected against injuries but its safe,honest" I wouldn't take it, why did millions?
0/0	If something happens, you can't sue the big Pharma
0/0	If something is free, you are the product
1/1	If stupidity was a liquid we'd all be drowning by the amount that would spill out of all anti-vaxxers constantly
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/0	If taking the vaccine means I can go back to living my life, sign me up. I‚Äôll take 6.
0/0/0	If that is not enough to get you convinced, nothing will, you are doomed. View the film VAXXED asap. Get on board with the anti-vaccination mouvement before its too late.
0/0	If the "virus" has over 99.7% recovery rate and the "vaccine" which is a sort of gene therapy does not offer immunity and does not stop the transmission, what's the point?
0/0	If the AZ vaccine does not work on the over sixty fives, why is the EU still jumping up and down and complaining that they aren't getting enough supplies?
1/1/1	If the Americans don't want it, send it to other countries. We'll gladly accept the vaccines
0/0	If the Aust government refuses to set up a safety net for its citizens to take the fast-tracked COVID vaccines, that has proved to be risky with harmful side effects, according to overseas data, then we can refuse to take such vaccines. I consent to nothing! #novax for me!
0/0	If the COVID 19 vaccines are safe, why were companies like Pfizer and Moderna given total immunity from liability under the PREP Act? Count me OUT! TRY TO FORCE ME! You are part of the lie
0/0	If the Economist really wanted to get the Vaccines they would demand that the civil liability shield on the big pharma vaccine producers be removed so that ordinary people can sue when they get severe side effects from their experimental products.
0/0/0/0/0/0	If the Media promotes it, avoid it.
1/1	If the Pfizer CEO says I need another shot in 12 months and it means we continue to move past this pandemic... SIGN ME UP BRUH
0/1	If the body's immune system is capable of recognizing the virus based on its spike proteins, why would we need to synthetically create them?
0/0	If the covid vaccine is safe then why are there no liabilities
0/0	If the criteria for safety (for vaccines) is measured in time how on earth can you deem somethng safe when the trials are months instead of the usual 10 to 15 years. This will backfire on them, they are waking up more than any truther channel ever could with their lies and socialist censorship.
0/0	If the government run these vaccination trials like they run border control I think I‚Äôll give it a miss my confidence with both of them is zero
1/1	If the grocery store cashier is going to promote vaccine conspiracy theories to everyone, I‚Äôm going politely hold up the line and spread facts. #vaccinate
0/0/0/0	If the human body ain't broken, then don't fix it.
0/0	If the mRNA message disappears so quickly, how does it make enough spike protein to trigger an immune response?
0/0	If the media promotes it, avoid it
0/0	If the people who made the vaccine can't be sued, that should speak for itself
1/1/1	If the top professionals in health care are having it, then it's good enough for me too
0	If the university requires the vaccine, they don't have to invest so heavily in the monitoring.
0/0	If the vaccine can‚Äôt do anything why take it? I‚Äôm not taking it at all I‚Äôm just trying to ask ppl out here
0/0	If the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect 100% , and you can still get the COVID after vaccination, why get it at all? It‚Äôs ridiculous and even dangerous. Nobody knows how our body is going to react with getting the vaccine. It‚Äôs not only bad for allergic people, as for we don‚Äôt know what damage to our body it can cause in the long term. No research can be done in a short term. I‚Äôm concern
0/0/0/0	If the vaccine is 95% effective and I already have a 99.99% chance of recovering within 4 days if I get COVID why would I need the vaccine?
0/0	If the vaccine is a choice,this whole bs is so contradictory and unethical!
1/1	If the vaccine is killing people then we are in serious trouble as most of our front line workers and medical personnel have taken the vaccine. I have had coovid19 and I am still getting the vaccine. I believe that our medical experts would not have mostly gotten the vaccine if it was dangerous. They are much more educated than me and if they feel it is safe for themselves and their family then I will trust their judgement.
1/1/1/1	If the vaccine is meets the approval of top immunologists and epidemiologists, then no doubt about it.
0/0/0	If the vaccine is so safe, then why it's soo free? Doesn't make sense. The government always tax u for something soo safe right üòÖ
1/1	If the vaccine is tested and shown to be effective, then how fast it was produced is irrelevant.
0/0	If the vaccine protects the person that‚Äôs been vaccinated then why do they care if we take it or not?ü§î
1/1	If the vaccine rollout has been a masterclass in incompetency, then the public health campaign that should have been running to promote confidence and takeup of the vaccines has been a total disaster.
0/-1	If the vaccine triggers an immune response than for the people that have had it why do they recommend getting the vaccine?... your body will have built up immunity to Covid .. sounds fishy ! I know many people including health care workers are not getting it
0/-1	If the vaccine works but I don't want it in my body, would you be offended?
1/-1	If the vaccines are effective, can we dump the masks?
0/0	If the vaccines are harmless then why has Pfizer been given protection from legal action by UK government?
1/1	If there is a vaccine for it, I have it.
0/0	If there is a vaccine there's gonna be side effects that we don't know about
0/0	If there is not a damn thing wrong with you, you don't need anything weird corrupting your health.
0/0	If there was a deadly virus wiping out humanity then maybe I would consider taking a vaccine but there isn't
1/1	If there's a word for an emotion that combines joy, gratitude, and fatigue, I'm that word today. Finally got vaccine against COVID!!
0/0	If these agencies actually were serious about the safety of these vaccines, they would never have put them on the market. They have not been adequately tested. No one knows the long-range effects, or even short-term effects, apparently. Anyone who takes these vaccines is nothing more than an unpaid, unprotected, guinea pig.
0/0	If these pharmaceutical corporations are going to protect themselves from litigation in case of injury and or death from their vaccines, I‚Äôll protect myself by not taking it
0/0	If these pharmaceutical corporations are going to protect themselves from litigation in case of injury and or death from their vaccines, I‚Äôll protect myself by not taking it.
0/0	If these vaccines are so effective, why are there reports of a third and fourth wave? Things that make you go hmmmm.
0/0	If these vaccines are so safe .. why are the companies producing them given immunity from prosecution when a few years down the line the shtf ?
0/0	If they are "safe and effective" why are the manufacturer's granted legal protection from injuries and death? 'Asking for a friend.'
1/1	If they are 16 or older they should get it. I wish my son could get it at 15. I have tried to find a trial but have not been successful.
0/0	If they are pushing it this hard, something is fishy about this shot. I think I'll pass and wait like 100 years to see the side effects.
1/1	If they can do this well, vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease.
1/1	If they can roll this out fast enough then good. Is it possible to get one of the other vaccines later down the line when they are more available.
1/1	If they don't get vaccinated then don't let them into our countries. Just as those that choose not to be vaccinated in the UK should not be permitted to travel outside of the UK
1/0	If they don't want a jab, then they become ill and perhaps die. Simples!
1/1	If they don't want it and they suffer ill effects of covid, unlucky for them. The vulnerable who could contract it from the unimmunised, should be vaccinated. So, in theory only the sceptics will suffer. They made their choice. Darwinism has gotten us this far :).
1/1	If they don't want it then don't give it to them. When they catch covid don't treat them.
1/1	If they don't want to get vaccinated fine, i'll gladly take the shot
1/1	If they dont want it we ll take it .just please hurry up lol
1/1	If they don‚Äôt want it don‚Äôt take it. stop telling everybody else their views, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs own choice, I choose yes, my choice.
1/1	If they gave me a choice it's J&J. Either way works for me
0/-1	If they offer the Vaccine to me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll give it to these guys and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have extra protection.
0/0/0/0	If they offer the Vaccine to me I‚Äôll give it to these guys and they‚Äôll have extra protection.
1/1	If they offered me a vaccine I would take it
1/1/0	If they say they have to inject it directly into my bollocks so I can do shit again then so be it
0/0	If they try I will fight back however I have to. I still have medical rights to refuse treatment.
1/1	If they won't take the vaccine and keep using conspiracy theories, then they should be denied a hospital bed if they get sick. That is the consequence for endangering other people's lives.
0/0	If they're forcing you to take the vaccine this is control like Hitler and this is really Satan..
0/0	If they're so safe and effective, why is old Biden still walking around masked everywhere virtual signaling after taking it (a clean one he was given I'm sure, or possibly a saline solution). They can't deny the fact that there are no liability wavers they'll sign in case there are long term effects, and they can't deny there are zero long term studies or tests on their experimental gene therapy. How do these people know that splicing and inserting genes from things like Jellyfish and putting into the human body has no unforeseen consequences. WE DON'T KNOW SHIT. Natural antibodies ftw, that's all you need. ESPECIALLY in regards to a flu-like illness that barely affects 99% of people. Don't forget old unhealthy Trump survived it.
1/1	If they're that stupid not to take the vaccine let them get the virus.
1/-1	If this covid 19 virus keeps going on for more time or years I think any covid 19 medication for the young kids or babies should be invented or available because you know the kids and babies are more sensitive than the adults and probably they can't handle a vaccination in the arm
1/1	If this moment doesn‚Äôt symbolize hope for the future of our country, I don‚Äôt know what does. New chapter of healing and progress.
0/0	If this rushed out ‚Äúharmless‚Äù magic potion is so safe,WHY ISN‚ÄôT Pfizer accepting liability for any adverse effects?!?!
1/1	If this vaccine comes out, I'm gonna be the first in line to get it. It is gonna be as refreshing as waking up from a nightmare
0/1	If this vaccine is so good why is it killing people all over the world
0/0	If this vaccine is ‚Äúso safe‚Äù why do you still have to wear a mask?
0/0	If this were a real pandemic the rich people would be prioritized to get vaccinated first.
1/-1	If too many people are afraid to get the vaccine, it is bad for the world, but I wont have to wait and will be immune. Eventually enough of the early adopters will prove the vaccine safe and others will get on the bandwagon.
1/1	If u dont wanna trust scientists and not take the vaccine, then keep yourself at home to reduce the spread of the virus-- that is if u arent a selfish prick and care about others in it community.
0/0	If u guys think that only 6 people were affected by these vaccines u are the dumbest person ever.
0/0	If u take the vaccine then take what comes with it!
0/0	If u want kids, don't take it
0/0	If vaccinated ppl r protected, why do they care? My body, my choice
1/1	If vaccinations are so bad, why has polio, smallpox, dipheria, and many other devastating illness been wiped out with global vaccination. When I was growing up the fear of polio was frightening until we were all vaccinated. Those that are bias against the Covid vaccination, are just putting the rest of us at risk, of getting it and maybe dying, or for the others who escape it, having to live in constant lockdowns for the rest of our lives.
0/-1	If vaccine so important, make it free... it is literally robbing the middle class
1/1	If vaccine were tewwibl as you say why presidents get vaccinated
0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract
0/0/0/0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract?
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract????
1/1	If vaccines are so bad, then how come we almost eradicated Polio and smallpox. Pre-vaccines, those were clearly an issue and post-vaccines, they aren't.
0/0/0/0	If vaccines are so safe why does the federal government protect big pharma from vaccine injury lawsuits? Today if you are injured by a vaccine you have to file suit with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and if you win the US taxpayer pays not Big Pharma!
0/0	If vaccines are so safe, then why do they not have any liability protection? Sounds like they are not that safe according to the manufacturers....Caveat Emptor.
1/1	If vaccines didn‚Äôt work, then why has the polio and measle rate decrease.
1/1	If vaccines were bad the population of the UK would be quite a few million less.
0/0	If vaccines worked how could an unvaccinated person be a danger?
0	If vax work, then why are people worried about people who don't get them?
1/1	If we all get the vaccine it won't have any mores hosts and it'll die out, like smallpox and polio.
1/1	If we all get vaccinated, this mess will soon be over.
0/0	If we are so confident regarding the vaccines, why are we TESTING THEM on volunteers?
1/1	If we assume the person dies because of vaccine.. Still 250000 people vaccinated and one died.. We can see the probability.. Dying of corona has higher possibility.. And it's not proven there could be many things in the picture . So just stop spreading hatred
1/1	If we can get at least 3+ million vaccine shots a day that would be fantastic.
1/1	If we can have a normal spring and summer I will be incredibly happy.
1/1	If we care about our families, our neighbors, and our communities we will vaccinate, PROUDLY.
1/1/1	If we continue vaccinating as many people as possible and follow the basic rules e.g. hands, face and space, I think we'll be fine, but then again I'm just the humble facebook expert....We just have to wait and see when everything reopens on June 21
1/0	If we do got a shot of the vaccine... Is there a chance that our DNA will be altered??? And right now we can speak English... If vaccine is from say Russia we will be fluent in Russian language after a few months... Or if vaccine is from China we will be fluent in speaking Chinese after a few months or years... Is that possible??? Hahaha
1/1	If we get vaccinated, the virus will disappear! All I want if my life back
1/1	If we had the vaccine year ago my Mom would be still with us.
1/1	If we had the vaccine year ago my Mom would be still with us. She left in March while we were standing in the hospital parkinglot.
0/-1	If we have existing safe and effective treatments, why have they been allowed to develop a vaccine at all.
0/0	If we have no rights to sue then they have no rights to force it up on us.
0/1	If we implant a chip or get a vaccination pasport this all could be avoided ,. ...people wake up!
0/0	If we know so little about COVID, how can an effective vaccine be produced? And how can ANY vaccine be produced without the testing that should be done which takes time? Can we REALLY expect a COVID vaccine to be ready in such a short period of time? There are drugs that have been out for YEARS that get recalled due to safety issues that far outweighed the benefits of the drug. The rush to vaccine is what scares me much more than the virus.
0/0	If we never closed down and listed causes of death properly the numbers would be the same as the flu every year. Funny how things like heart disease all but disappeared this year. Oh wait those people died of covid and not hear disease that's right. rolls eyes
1/1	If we only had this in Sweden, whole country could've been vaccinated in two weeks. I guess this is one of the upsides of brexit
1/1	If we were not a little skeptical I would say we are not too smart. Much pressure put on scientist labs etc. I am skeptical a lot but I also believe in science and will take.
0/0	If you EVER try to force a vaccine on anyone I love, I will personally start a civil war. GET THAT IN YOUR FAT FUCKING HEAD
1/1	If you all want to die painfully and slowly then so be it! Don't take the vaccine, lets see how far it gets you fools.
1/1	If you are 45 years or above ensure you get vaccinated. Prevention is better than cure, stay safe n stay blessed
0/0	If you are PRO VACCINE you are an IDIOT!
1/1	If you are afraid of a vaccine I can't imagine how many other things you people are afraid of in life keep hiding in your safe spaces you fucking babies
0/0	If you are forced by your job then quit. This is a poison made for depopulation.
0/0	If you are going to force it on us. Then we should be able to sue the company‚Äôs if this Vaccination causes ill side effects.
0/0	If you are healthy absolutely do NOT take any vaccine. Various reasons. Would be a really a lot to explain.
0	If you are healthy, not living the standard American diet, staying active, eating clean, are young, taking care of your mind etc... you do not need a vaccine. Your body is strong enough to fight for itself. This is why they are advertising free donuts for a year for people who take the vaccine.... it just tells you.
0/0	If you are not in a vulnerable so the chances of you being even seriously ill are say 1 in 100,000 then the vaccine has to be safer than that. It's a simple balance of risk. I would not take the flu jab each year if it was likely to cause a severe asthma attack. I'd risk the flu despite my asthma
0/0	If you are pro-vaccine then you are anti-science.
1/1	If you are shocked about 7 people getting blood clots from the 7 million people who took the J & J vaccine, wait till I tell you about how many people died who didn‚Äôt get a vaccine at all.
1/1	If you are told you can book your #COVID19 vaccine, you are helping to save lives
0/0	If you are under 40 years old with no health issues then you may as well wait or not get it at all. I'm not going out of my way to get sick, but if I do get sick then I'll be sick and then move on with my life.
1/1	If you are vaccinated you have a significantly lower chance of catching it and transmitting it to others, which is significantly reduced if others around you are also vaccinated
0/0/0/1	If you are worrying about being forced to take the experimental jab - don‚Äôt. There are many of us out there who will never get the vaccine, and we will fight this to the bitter end. The only way they succeed is if people surrender. They cannot force us all. Hold the line.
0/0	If you believe a word the government says, and don't forget it's not a vaccine, just damage limitation with blood clots
0/0	If you believe that the vaccine will keep you safe from the virus.. why do you care if some people don't take the vaccine?
0/0	If you can still pass Covid on with the vaccine then why are they telling you to get it to protect the vulnerable?
0/0/0/0/0	If you can still spread coronavirus with the vaccine then why are they forcing people to take it?
1/1	If you care about your friends and family, take the shot
0/0	If you care about your loved ones say NO to the corona vaccine! #CoronaVaccine #Covid_19 #vaccination new hashtags #say_no_to_vaccine #saynotovaccine #sayno !
1/1	If you catch Covid-19, you're more likely to suffer serious health implications that from a Vaccine so why choose the risker option?
1/1	If you choose not to get vaccinated for a deadly virus. Then you should be treated like someone who chose not to get vaccinated for a deadly virus
0/0/0/0	If you die and could be suspected of having had covid within the past 12 months it's labelled as "covid death" and becomes main stream news. If you die within 48 hours after being vaccinated it's played off as "no cause for concern" or "the patient was too frail".
0/0	If you die and could be suspected of having had covid within the past 12 months it's labelled as "covid death" and becomes main stream news. f you die within 48 hours after being vaccinated it's played off as "no cause for concern" or "the patient was too frail".
1/1	If you do not have polio, thank a vaccine, if you do not see wide spread cases of mumps , measles, chicken pox or any other childhood diseases, thank a vaccine. Those that protest vaccine distribution have forgotten why we no longer see diseases that plagued the world 50 years ago
1/1	If you do not take the vaccine, you are selfish / an egoist!
1/1	If you don't take it ask for God protection.
1/1	If you don't want it - fine. More for the people who want it. I have a dead friend and father-in-law who did not have the luxury of choosing.
1/1	If you don't want to get the shot fine but don't stop anybody else from getting it
1/1	If you don't want to get the vaccine that's fine.....your choice....leave the rest of us to get on with life!!!
0/0	If you dont trust government, why would you trust this?, after all, it too is governed.
1/1	If you dont want the economy to collapse, save us by being vaccinated
1/-1	If you dont want your loved ones to end up in the hospital due to the virus, then the choice is clear
1/1	If you don‚Äôt get the vaccine and get covid you could die, your. Choice
1/1	If you don‚Äôt like vaccinations then you deal with it on your own. Don‚Äôt go pushing and forcing your your beliefs on someone else. Especially when it comes to science. If your health is at risk where do you go? The doctor? The hospital? Guess what. There‚Äôs science behind the medications they give you. If people want to vaccinate then let them. Let us. This is just so dumb.
1/0	If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine and get infected, you‚Äôre giving the virus another chance to mutate towards something new that the vaccine can‚Äôt protect other vaccinated people from. If the new virus that evolves in your body spreads again, the pharmaceutical company won‚Äôt have readily studied vaccine against it. In another sentence, the vaccine would be outdated, if there‚Äôs such a mutation. Therefore, by not taking the vaccine, you could be aiding the virus in its evolution and forcing everyone to go through the pandemic again.
1/1	If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine you are clearly a conspiracy theorist and spend too much time on YouTube, the experts want to save our lives and help us, I‚Äôm really happy to take this wonderful vaccine. Don‚Äôt let hospitals be over capacity. Protect the USAüëè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1/1	If you don‚Äôt want it then don‚Äôt take it! Move over and let the ones that want it!! You are an adult and can make adult decisions!! Covid will not disappear so if you don‚Äôt take it you take that risk of getting it then pending on yourself how your body will react to this virus and would be worse if you have other health problems!! You choice!!
0/0	If you ever have to ask the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù The answer almost always revolves around money. üí∞
0/0	If you get a bad reaction to the small vaccine quantity the likelihood is covid itself will kill you , please refuse your second jab it's important natural selection continues
1/1	If you get a vaccine it can protect you from certain disease SO DO IT YOU IDIOTS
0/0	If you get the vaccine stay away from me. I don‚Äôt want to contract what they put inside your body that even you have no idea what‚Äôs inside of you..
1/1	If you get these feelings, that means your body is putting all of the energy that would be in your muscles and head into antibody production and immunizing yourself. If you feel like crap, that means its working!
0/-1	If you go against the narrative, you're ridiculed because you're not a medical professional. Yet people who take it all as gospel get their truths from Z-list celebrities and wealthy influencers with serious conflicts of interest.
1/1/1	If you have allergies to vaccines dont get them but dont prevent others from getting them.
0/0	If you have an underlying health condition, do not take a risk with your immune-system. These mRNA vaccines are novel, and testing then in-vivo on humans is against the Nuremberg charter. Doctor Mengele would be proud, and you should be absolutely ashamed.
1/1	If you have been vaccinated and happen to be unlucky enough to be infected by COVID-19, it will be much milder than if you had not been vaccinated. It? close to 100% (in fact it was 100% in clinical trials) that you will not be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 if vaccinated
1/1	If you have the opportunity, get the vaccine.
1/1	If you have the option of taking either Moderna or Pfizer's mRNA vaccines now, I would take that. It's unlikely the AstraZeneca/Oxford will be better.
0/0/0	If you have to go on national tv and ‚Äúget a vaccine‚Äù to show other people they should get it, it‚Äôs probably something you should stay away from
1/1	If you have to result to believing fake news articles just cause you don't believe in the vaccine you're a special kind of stupid.
0/1	If you haven‚Äôt experienced COVID yet, take the vaccine, great experience
0/0	If you lift the mask and social distancing mandate, I‚Äôll think about getting the vaccine. Not until then.
1/0	If you like feeling sick and you like feeling ill best thing for you to do is to get your vaccine.
0/0	If you look at biden get vaxed, his arm is super jacked. Either an 80 year old man is jack diesel or.... It's a body double
0/0	If you look closely immediately after she had the vaccine she started blinking sideways
0/1	If you participated in any of the covid-19 vaccines, you may be entitled to compensation.
1/1	If you refuse to take a vaccine you should not be allowed to work a public facing job putting others at high risk
1/1	If you refuse vaccinations there, you lose the right to any state-provided benefits. If you choose to have the vaccinations (which are free), then you get the benefits back again. It's the perfect policy, since it only punishes those who choose to be stupid.
1/1	If you ride a motorcycle with a helmet on and follow all rules, you can still get into an accident and die. That doesn't mean it is the same as getting drunk, taking drugs, closing your eyes and driving at 120 kmph on the wrong side. Both have chances of an accident. But the chances of accidental death in the helmet using, rule following case is much lower than in the drunk, drugged driver. Same with vaccines, masks, social distancing.. They reduce chances of infection, hospitalization and death. Nothing is 100 percent effective. Doesn't mean they don't work
0/0	If you survive the first dose - they'll allow you to have another :-/
0/0	If you take it, you will be a GMO. The MRNA in it will alter your DNA for ever. You are also participating in a trial. There is no long term safety data on this kind of "Gene Therapy". Good luck!
0/0	If you take the experimental vaccine and suffer like hundred is thousands have then ......
0/0/0	If you take the jab you will die
0/-1	If you take the shot, YOU are the study. May the odds be ever in your favor.
0/0	If you take the vaccine you are a human lab experiment. There is no arguing around that
0/0	If you take the vaccine you'll become ill and die
0/0	If you take the vaccine, you'll get what you deserve for being a easily manipulated dummy.
0/0	If you think injections of poisons that include toxic metals and aborted fetal tissue are "healthy", then you deserve every vaccine in the world.
0/0/0	If you think you can use violence against other people‚Äôs will, expect an equal and opposite reactions. I'm not taking any "vaccine", it's all poison.

0	If you turn green and your arm falls off it means it‚Äôs working
1/0	If you vaccinate the willing and then lift lockdown the herd immunity will sort itself out. Those that won't get vaccinated would get immunity the natural way or die.
1/1	If you wanna be smart, then you take the vaccine
0/0	If you want kids don‚Äôt get it. The elite are trying to depopulate the earth.
1/1	If you want to feel even more secure, you have way more chance of getting a blood clot taking an airplane: 1 out of 5000. And there are so few cases of the clots, I am confident they will find a connection between the people (like all on birth control pills). It's still safe.
0/0	If you want to get this vaccine then so be it, it‚Äôs your body. As for me...I‚Äôm good. God gave me a healthy immune system to work and fight, so if I were to catch the virus then my body will fight it the natural way. No way in hell do I trust this vaccine.
1/1	If you want to save your life, take the vaccine. It cures the virus by 100%
1/1	If you won't take the vaccine why are you wearing a mask
1/0	If you would give informed consent and be transparent about the risks and the adverse events we would have a proper picture. These are experimental liability free products with the worst safety rollout of any vaccine in history.
1/1	If you're are scared of covid-19, get the vaccine, you should be protected, even if others didn't get the vaccine.
1/1	If you're informed enough, you should be more scared of the side effects of the virus. It works nicely because the educated will vaccinate and the undereducated and misinformed will suffer.
1/1	If you're lucky enough to have the vaccine available, GET IT!
1/1	If you're not getting it because it's "rushed" you're mistaken
0/0	If you're planning intaking this vaccine (I won't), I suggest you ask your doctor or nurse what's in the vaccine. You should know what's being injected into your body.
0/0	If you're thinking about getting the vaccine, have taken that vaccine, or giving it to your kids you are dumbest person there ever was and there is a special place in hell for you

0/0	If you‚Äôre breathing and have a pulse, DO NOT TAKE THE POISON.
1/1	If you‚Äôre neither immune to nor vaccinated against Covid and are not properly and consistently wearing a good quality and sanitary face mask while completely following safety protocols, then you are consciously choosing to be a liability to other people. Your freedom of choice ‚Äî your personal responsibility ‚Äî your soul.
1/1	If you‚Äôre offered the vaccine, please accept it, like I did today
1/1	If you‚Äôve ever been vaccinated before did you know what the development process was for those vaccines? No you didn‚Äôt... so why are you so hesitant now?
0/-1	If you‚Äôve ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in the COVID vaccines, you should not get either of them, the CDC says.
1/1	If, like me, you‚Äôre lucky enough to have been offered the Cover vaccine just say YES
1	Ignorance will continue to make c-19 stay around for a while longer. I can‚Äôt comprehend why people don‚Äôt want to get some protection. It boggles my mind.
0/1	Ignoring lives of Indian citizens and taking pride by exporting vaccine is the name of #VaccineMaitri is not good for our loved ones. India is a country of 1400 million... even if India inoculates 3.3 million/day it will require 2800/(3.3x365)=2.3 years for 2 doses of vaccine Folded hands

0/0/0/0	Im kind of concerned about the speed of which this vaccine is being produced, they are using a method that has never been used before for vaccine production, I don't want them to screw this up badly and go down the same way as the first polio vaccine

1/1	Im vaccinated and don't like the idea of this country going back to an exclusionary society. Biden wants to unite the country not divide it more.
1/1	Im very pro vaccine and while I understand this was developed more quickly than most I believe it was because all of our resources were given to this goal. I am hesitant only because we have not had enough time to see the long term effects of the vaccine. Only time can tell that
1/1	Im with all vaccines
0	Imagine a person has covid without symptoms and they are given the vaccine and their condition worsens
0/0	Imagine a vaccine created before they had the information to create it. Seems very suspicious.

1/0	Imagine getting a life changing vaccine and nothing changes in your life. Still have to wear a mask, still have to social distance, and oh you still might get covid. Lmao.
1/-1	Imagine getting rid of all these just for anti vaxxers to bring them back

0/0/-1	Imagine wanting cancer this badly.
1/1	Imagine what life would be like today if at the height of the polio pandemic, people decided they didn't want to get vaccinated because they thought they knew more about the vaccines than the scientists who made them.
0/1	Imagine, a vaccine so safe , they force and threatening you to take it. Against a disease so deadly , you have to get checked to see if you have it .
0/-1	Imma go ahead and call it. Years down the road, maybe sooner people are gonna have major permanent side effects and there will be documentaries explaining what went wrong. It'll be just like the AIDS epidemic and the Tuskegee experiment. Don't fall for it people and stay prayed up.
1/1	Imma preface my next few tweets by saying I am happily pro vaccine. I've had many a vaccine myself. The thing is most people think a vaccine means you won't catch the disease. Which is usually the case. HOWEVER none of the current covid19 vaccines prevent you catching the virus.
1/1	Immune systems are a gamble. Vaccines aren‚Äôt.
0/0	Immuniti is better than vaccination
0/0	Immunization is total nonsense! More than that is what's hidden from people about vaccines.
0/0	Immunization is total nonsense! More than that is what's hidden from people about vaccines. They are dangerous. One child out of five has overwhelming disabilities from vaccines -- neurological problems, seizures
0/0	Immuunsysteem!! The best 'vaccine' your own body makes.
1/1	Important to vaccinate those who are in the first line of infection or more exposed ones
1/1	Importantly, politicians and public figures must be out there promoting vaccination as soon as it's available - antivax morons already have a head start
0/0	Improve your immunity Vit D, Vit E sunlight and get some rest, stay fit......not a injection
0/0	In 10 years lawyers will be advertising ‚Äú If you were weak minded and got covid vaccine - you are entitled to monetary compensation‚Äù from the pity fund.

0/0	In California, state officials rescinded a temporary pause on some of their Moderna vaccinations after several people received medical treatment for potential severe allergic reactions.
0/0	In Canada we have many people who have developed bells palsy after taking vaccone.. many seniors have died after taking vaccine and many seniors have come down with covid 19 after taking vaccine. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock involving days of hospitalization and reovvurong days of hospitalization...and bellspalsy effecting all ages.
1/1	In Finland, they are now considering also using the Sputnik V vaccine to speed up the global effort to vaccinate the population.
1/1	In India we are keenly awaiting this vaccine. Serum Institute in Pune, one of the licensed manufacturers of the Oxford vaccine, has already started production.
0/0	In Japan, Lung disease, Pneumonia,Asthma, "Mask mouth"oral cancers, Bronchial related deaths are up 400% When oh when will the sheeple wake up and realize that they compromise our brilliant God Given Immune Systems!?!?Horrible, painful side effects from ALL the fake covid vaccines! Hideous way to die! Let us never EVER forget that this Gates/Fauchi/WHO Wuhan lab orchestrated flu was created for the lethal depop injection roll out disguised as a vaccine. NOT the other way around. No wonder why the word "pharmaceutical" means "witchcraft" "poison" "sorcery" "occultism" "black magic" etc.. Big Pharma$$$ EVIL on steroids. Wake Up SHEEEPLE!
0/0	In Norway they just stopped vaccinating the 80+ people after they got 23 deaths in one place. Think at it.. This vaccine is especially NOT appropriate exactly for the same group that needed it the most! ü§Æ And it was authorized from FDA for 80+ people although Pfizer has NEVER tested it on people over 74!!! What does this tell you? The biggest medical scam in history! And there are already so many related deaths with this vaccine worldwide. But that‚Äôs okay. It was to be expected! And at the same time, medical treatment like HCQ - Hydrochloroquine is still forbidden in many States, just because after 70 years and billions of doses with no problem, TWO cases of heart attack were reported. After examination it was found they had nothing to do with HCQ!! And there are meanwhile over 150 studies worldwide that confirm that it is now one of the most effective treatment against Covid. Same for Ivermectin, that is still not authorized from FDA and CDC. Do you see any problem there??? They are screwing us the most they can, just to enrich politicians and big pharma. And at the same time they let their folk die and they kill the economy.
1/-1	In Russia, during the same time, several variants of the vaccine were created and all without side effects. But I think that you would rather kill your citizens than acknowledge the effectiveness of the Russian vaccine.
1/1	In Russia, everyone is vaccinated with sputnikV and everything is fine.

1/1	In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, we presented data collected in Australia in April, 2020, which suggested 86% of people surveyed (3741 of 4362) would be willing to vaccinate against COVID-19 if a vaccine became available.
0/0	In a couple months, it will be easy to tell who got vaccinated and who didn't. Because vaccinated people will be dead or mentally handicapped.
0/0	In a couple of years the people that didn‚Äôt take will be very lucky.
0/0	In a few years, a commercial on tv from the Sakolove Law firm will ask, "Did you, or a family member receive the Covid vaccine? If so, you could be entitled to a large settlement. Call us today!"
1/1	In a normal world devoid of US driven New Cold War nonsense, this approval process would have been expedited urgently long ago to help with the pandemic. It's all so pathetic.
1/-1	In a racially diverse study population, people with diabetes who took the drug metformin were less likely to die of COVID-19
0/-1	In a recent survey, 24% of Americans said they will refuse a coronavirus vaccine.
1/1	In a way we should thank anti vaxxers for their sacrifice.. more vaccines for sane people üò∑
1/-1	In a year when her immunity is reached they will essentially do away with the sickness.
0/-1	In addition to the typical vaccination reactions, there were also individual cases of sometimes severe side effects after vaccination, such as allergic shocks, which were reported in detail
1/0	In all seriousness, vaccines do kill...‚Ä¶.. ...the chance of easily preventable diseases taking people's lives
0/0	In doctor they trust. Bad mistake.
1/1	In fact I feel better than after the first shot where I just had some deltoid tenderness. Now I feel normal!
0/0	In fact, the scariest part is to read that so many people fall in the trap of this vaccine/poison.
0/0	In fact, there is no proof, based on gold standard double blind placebo controlled published tests, that the new covid vaccines actually are worthy of being claimed safe and effective. There is a strong likelihood that covid will mutate and render as useless any current potential vaccine effectiveness. You school, your church, and your town are run by jesuits, and if you don't understand this, they are happy for you to stay warm, fuzzy, and happily nestled cozy in their snare.
1/-1	In general I got all the standard vaccinations, but need to check what needs refreshing (lazy lazy)
1/1	In high risk so I‚Äôm probably getting mine next month
1/1	In honor of all the scientists and leaders who share facts and data even when it‚Äôs hard. You have brought us to this place of hope by covid vaccine.
1/-1	In india everyone treats vaccines as a god send(as they should) and I'm guessing this is same in all developing countries
0/0	In my Randy Jackson voice: "Thats gonna be a NO for me dawg....
1/-1	In my area a couple years ago, a pediatric nurse was intentionally screwing up lots of kids standard vaccines. She was fired, of course. But many kids had to redo a bunch of shots. There's crazy idiots everywhere
1/-1	In my area, health care professionals have said that they'll probably be the first to take the vaccine. Therefore, there's a huge requirement for the medication to ve safe and effective
1	In my country only health workers are receiving Covid vaccine. I want to receive the vaccine too . Now I wear mask; I clean my hands with water and soap. I keep social distance. It is prevention.
1/1	In my country vaccines are obligatory, and honestly thank God, we don't have antivaxxers that are activists, everyone in my family is vaccinated, none are authistic, but I do have older relatives that were born latr 40's early 50's that carry lifelong side effects of polio, I still don't understand how people can doubt vaccines when the evidence that they work is sooo overwhelmin
1/1	In my experience as a physician and pediatrician, many antivaxxers are in fact narcissists (or are echoing their narcissist spouses).
0/0	In my opinion it is too early for the discovery of a vaccine. Recall that we were told it was not dangerous and it will not be and it would not be infectious worldwide
0/-1/0	In my opinion, most vaccines are just prototypes at this moment. They need to perfect it more in order to be even considered for vaccinations
1/1	In my opinion, the vaccine is good.
1/1	In my personal view also by vaccinating we will be in safer side!Otherwise the Covid-variants of stronger characters as of U.K. & S.A. may appear & attack us.
1/1	In normal times it would be expected to get up to 300 cases of blood clots per month for three million people. We got 22. Well below normal.
0/0	In norway 23 dead so far from it.
0/0	In order to not get sick, I'm gonna get sick via injection just so I won't get sick this specific way again?
1/1	In order to safeguard the health of my employees, clients and others my advise to those who refuse Covid vaccination would be best is to look elsewhere for employment
1/1	In other words - yeah, you absolutely are protected once vaccinated. Go live your life! Get back to normal! Enough of this ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt change anything‚Äù bullsh*t!

0/0	In our history this is a defying moment .. no to the vaccine ...
1/1	In our late 70‚Äôs, my husband and I would like the shot. However, we are unable to in PA. It is depressing. We have tried everything. The state website is useless and our doctors can‚Äôt help us. We have been abandoned.
1/1	In our society if you don't have the right to assault somebody, you shouldn't have the right to give someone a virus that is potentially deadly.
0/0	In portugal 41 year old nurse died 3 days after Pfizer Biontech first vaccine dose, she was healthy.
0/-1	In reality, everyone should be tested for antibodies BEFORE getting any vaccines. Then, see if you need a vaccine or not.
1/1	In some countries you can be thrown in jail if you deny the holocaust. I'd like to see the same happen to covid and vaccine deniers.
0/0/0	In summary:. People that know the truth are not getting the vaccine.
0/0	In the Catholic religion said one day people will be crying in the street once U find out whats in that vaccine shot u will be crying in the street..
0/0	In the UK we‚Äôve had two lockdowns to prevent people from catching Covid. And now we‚Äôre injecting Covid into all those people who avoided Covid during the lockdowns.
1/1	In the USA they are really relaxed about vaccinations. Just follow the rules set by your state/city. Or go to Texas where they give out vaccines to anybody who asks for one, no ID required.
1/1	In the context of an uncontrolled pandemic that already has killed 1 in 600 in the US, only an innumerate would consider the possibility of a COVID-vaccine reaction that kills 1 in 7 million to be grounds to interrupt vaccine rollout.
1/1	In the first 50 years of the 1800s (when modern medical science was still in its infancy), the average life expectancy in the US was 37 years. You were lucky to make it out of childhood, if you lived to 50, that was a full life. In 2019, the average US life expectancy is 79 years. Science works y'all. Don't fix what ain't broke.
0/0/0	In the german city of emden 28 caretakers took sickdays after being injected with that garbage from astrazeneca. They had problems keeping open
0/0	In time I will take it. When I am dead.
0/-1	In your next analysis of the vaccines, please focus on the side effects and danger aspects of the vaccines.
1/0	Increase immunity by being a dirty bastard. It's true, look into it. If you stay clean, your body won't get exposed. You must slowly expose yourself in order for your immunity to strengthen. Or vaccinate where possible.
1/1	Incredible breakdown of the efficacy of the vaccines. This reaffirms that we must trust the Science...Thank you.
1/1	Incredible how so many gulliable people actually belive that the vaccine is anything other than humanity trying to save lives.
1	Incredible. These vaccines are true life savers.
1/1	Incredibly grateful to have received my first COVID19 vaccine dose today!!
1/1	Incredibly proud of our unwavering efforts at Johnson & Johnson to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. A humbling moment and an important milestone.

1/1	Indeed, a vaccine passport is very much necessary to combat the Whackjobs.
1/1	Indeed, we're hopping that the vaccine will leads us to a new safe world.
1/1	India is full of illiterates and literates with no sense. Every vaccine has side effects, so has the corona vaccine, but no serious side effects are reported. Vaccination is a process by which we can save ourselves from Covid 19.If there will be an attack, the same will be mild.

1/1	Indian vaccination program is the most effective
0/0	Ineffective at best, Poison at worst, No thanks!
1	Infecting 1800 people without offering them vaccines or variolation strikes me as more unethical. I'm only even mentioning the shorter sentences in a flailing attempt to grasp how other people see trialing unproven protection as somehow more terrifying than zero protection.
0/0	Infertility on its way. Ill definitely not take it.
1/-1	Information and education about this new vaccine is very important. So, thank you so much for this very accurate and detailed explanation
1/1	Informative and easy to understand The goal of the vaccines is to prevent you from the death (effectiveness) while minimising you to go to hospital (efficacy)
1/1	Informative, thoughtfully produced. Give it to me..I‚Äôll take it..in fact I would volunteer for phase 3
1/1	Inject that shit straight into my veins.
0/0	Injecting an active virus ü¶† into your body. The percentage of Covid survival rate is 99.98% for healthy people. Why inject a foreign substance into your body. The media is a great propaganda tool. üêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêë

1/1	Injection #2 is done! #covidvaccine #thisisourshot #vaccineswork
0/0	Insanity! The world has gone mad!!
1/1	Insisting on another a study of 30,000 people to get the AZ vaccine is pretty nuts when you could just take a look at the 1 million Brits who have already received it. In the meantime another ~100,000 Americans will die but whatevs I guess
1/1	Instantly with no hesitation whatsoever.
1/1	Instead of acting like decent empathetic human beings and doing the easy steps to eradicate the disease we are going to let the disease fester and mutate into worse and worse variants.
0	Instead of being part of a vaccine experiment: do Yoga, eat well, and take cold showers.
1/1	Instead of believing one can study and learn. Which is what they have done. If you have no time or any other reason to learn, you have to trust the experts. The same way you probably go on an airplane and trust the pilot to let it fly.
0/0	Instead of getting vaccinated, treat your covid naturally if it is not severe
1/1	Instead of jumping to conclusions like a moron, I want to actually do my research and see if this ‚ÄúDNA Changing‚Äù thing is bs or not, but blindly saying it‚Äôs poison just because you cba to research this is not the way to go
1/1	Instead of throwing the vaccine out, start pulling people off the street to give a shot.
0/-1/0	Insufficient data is not good enough ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
0/0	Interesting how most people would never consider buying a new car with no warranty but not even think twice about putting some chemical in their body made by some company that has full legal immunity which people have died from.
0/0	Interesting how the vaccine and rise in cases and they predict a rise as more in the next couple of months ...hmmmn..sound a little more than telling that they are not safe
0/0	Interesting that anti bodies only last a few month...but vaccine works??
0/0	Interesting they didn‚Äôt mention the facial paralysis after taking vaccine lol
0/0	Interesting, my step father had his first shot about a month and a half ago. Missed his second shot due to falling. He died 2 days ago complaining of a headache. Seriously its going to become time to keep your firearms very very close guys.
1/-1	Interesting. But did they take into account the new variants? For example, many people are being reinfected in Brazil with the new P.1 variant. I would love to see the real study and its limitations.
0/0	Interesting. It's almost like they haven't got a clue what vaccine does what. Yeah, it "should" protect you. Just give it try.
0	Introduce a vaccine in the late stages of a pandemic (just like measles and polio) and claim credit for its natural decline. This always works.
0/-1	Investigating this for my brother .he nervous about getting vaccine .he had allergies as a kid and takes some medicines
1/1	Ironic that people are afraid of a vaccine but are willing to devour fast food and sit on their ass all day.
1/0	Ironic that these children's parents are vaccinated and fine.. Well as fine as you can get to prefer a dead kid over an autistic kid. Anyone who wants a dead child over an autistic kid doesn't even deserve a kid.
1/1	Ironic. YOU dig deeper, instead of "digging" for controversial / conspiratorial information by clicking on the first result on Google.
0/0	Ironically the guy who died was 59 but the only concern is young people. I guess older people don't matter, it's a case of " "Thanks for your contribution to this country. You have served your useful purpose, goodbye"
0/0	Ironically the vaccine shows very little proof of protection from the original virus or any subsequent variant thereafter! If anything, the pathogenic priming could leave you substantially more susceptible to any future variant!
0/0	Is everyone ok with being injectd with an EXPERIMENTAL, toxic vax? They are making it up as they go a long, it's still a big NO from me
0/0	Is getting the vaccine or not on a spectrum too? I'm leaning to the NOT getting it side..
0/1	Is it bad that I‚Äôm more scared of getting the vaccine than getting Covid? I‚Äôm not anti vax at all, but I am so anxious about getting a vaccine that came out so fast. I‚Äôm worried about the horrible effects it could have and no I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for everyone
0/0	Is it just me or have you all noticed that as soon as the vaccine came out to give to the public, that‚Äôs exactly when the virus started mutating?
0/-1	Is it relabeled expired Bird flu vaccines?
0/0	Is it true mRNA vaccines can change the cells in your body and by that I mean in a bad way
0/0	Is it true that the vaccines can lead to infertility or low sperm count on men?
0/0	Is it wrong for me to skeptical to take a brand new drug considering in my lifetime I have seen Vioxx, fen-phen, and now Zantac recalled and/or linked to cancers and heart issues?
1/0	Is one safer than the other?
0/0	Is that the protein that inhibits placenta formation in human females? The one those two German doctors blew the whistle on and got silenced? Is that the same protein that has caused "false" positives for HIV? Yeah, that's completely fine, all of it and the other 30 or so diseases and syndromes, all just fine. Where can I sign the 2 release forms that negate any liability of the pharmaceutical companies for possible death with 2 days of receiving this experimental "vaccine"??
0/0	Is the #CovidVaccine turning recipients into super spreaders...
0/0	Is the vaccine safe? Not as safe as not taking it
0/0	Is the world under some type of mass hypnosis? I can't believe how many people are willingly getting the jab.
1/0/-1	Is there any logical reason to be wary of this vaccine causing issues with female fertility???
0/0/0	Is there any reason whatsoever for me to get this poison?
0/1	Is there any treatment available...no it's only to get vaccinated which is still not the kind of solution the world needs
0/-1	Is this Vaccine safe for ASTHEMETIC and Heart Patients?
0/0	Is this injection even a 'vaccine' by definition?
1/-1	Is this real? Please say it is, I am really sick and slightly scared about this and wish this whole Covid-19 horse shit would be over!!!!
0/-1	Is this vaccine really safe? Have enough clinical studies been done? I wld hate to think it gets the ok like thalidomide did- then causes major problems...
0/0	Islam must reject the poison, do not be fooled people üôè
1/1	Isn't it absolutely incredible that ~1 year after the outbreak of COVID-19 we have interim data on 7 vaccines and 10's of millions of people are already vaccinated?!? This is a true testament to the power of science, incredibly dedicated people and a whole lot of hard work.
0/0/0	Isn't it suspicious tho that a vaccine was developed rather quickly?
1/0	Isn't it weird how when this video was released a month ago there was barely any anti vaxxer conspiracy theorists in the comments, but in the last 2/3 weeks they came out of nowhere, i wonder why √∞≈∏¬§‚Äù
0/0	Isn't ivermectin doing both the job of vaccine and treating. Why are we bothering with vaccines?
1/1	Isn't science great.
1/1	Isn't science great? Take that fucking vaccine so!
0/-1	Isn‚Äôt it amazing how all of the birds, squirrels, dogs, cats and other wildlife aren‚Äôt affected? They don‚Äôt wear masks or use sanitizer.
0/0	Isn‚Äôt refusing rather strong languages. I don‚Äôt want it cause biologically I‚Äôm better served allowing my immune system to beat covid un aided by an agent injected into my body. As have millions of people defeated covid with their evolutionary sound immune system.
1/1	Israel is a tiny country. Arizona is doing well vaccinating people.
1/1	Israel sees big drop in COVID cases among vaccinated.
1/1	Israel started their vaccine rollout 6 weeks ago and is beginning to see its effects with constant drop of cases (esp in age people 60+). This is brought upon by simple vaccination requirements, great healthcare system, and proactive acquisition of vaccines
1/1	Israel: Another view of the vaccine effect. Nationwide, drop in the fraction of cases, hospitalizations, and critically ill in people 60 years old and above (who were prioritized first for vaccination) out of all age groups
1/1	Israeli data and guptas limited data reflects much lower protection afyer first dose and improves radically after second. Pfizers protocol is three weeks not 12.
1/0	Israeli data supports Pfizer vaccine effectiveness - 128,600 fully vaccinated, 20 positive COVID cases
0/0	It attacks a protein in the placenta rendering women sterile.
1/1	It blows my mind that people still don‚Äôt believe in vaccines even after we‚Äôve seen it eradicated a whole disease
1/1	It boils down to this .. take the vaccine and your chances of having fatal or severe symptoms are greatly diminished. Refuse the vaccine and you and your immune system are on your own, It is that stark and simple.
1/1	It can be painful but worth it
0/0	It can't even be called a vaccine! The time of trial hasn't been respected at all! Look for other sources of information!
0/0	It cannot stop the virus
0/-1	It certainly does seem to be a very strange virus. Killed many in Wuhan and surrounding areas and yet not one case in nearby Beijing where all important ' stuff ' happens üòÇüòÇ
0/0	It changes your DNA & PUTS SOFTWARE IN YOUR BODY!! You'll Liberal creep! Aren't going to mention Bell's Palsey, the deaths, etc??? They killed 46 million with the Swine flu vaccine in the 70's, CDC, Gates and Fauchi!
0/0	It could be argued that these vaccines, or the policies that were built around them, have led to far more death and suffering than they have prevented.
0/0	It damages way more than it kills. 10% are long haulers even after a mild dose . It can cause organ and brain damage .
0/0	It does Not matter whether it is a hoax or not. The fact is FREEDOM of Choice. My Body, My Choice to not or to take it. I've been here six and a half decades, without taking any Medication or visiting a Doctor. Why start Now. "don't fix it, if it ain't broken".
0/0	It does have potential side effects
0/1	It does matter if a healthy 20 y/o gets vaccine, because that's an opportunity for the virus to mutate.
0/0	It does not end the pandemic!!! It's the biggest lie ever perpetrated on mankind! Stop the deadly vaccine!!
0/0	It doesn't help that RNA vaccines crash your lymphocyte counts for up to a week, leaving you open to infections (possibly including Covid?) They do know about this from both the b1 & b2 trials.
1/1	It doesn't matter whether the public want or don't want vaccine passports. We will NEED them. It's not enough to have a jab - you will need to keep your regular booster jabs up. A bit like an MOT, a vaccine passport will prove that you are up to date with protection.
0/0	It doesn? feel like it? right for me , gut feeling the vaccine isn? readyCertainly don? care what you do with your bodyBut when I think about it I feel no with my whole being . So that? that for me- not antivax I just don? think that one is for me
0/0	It doesnt work and it kills.
0/0	It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs right for me
0/0	It doesn‚Äôt seem that either one of them would rush you get the vaccine. I am 64, and I am certainly NOT.
0/0	It failed them scientists decades till now to get aids vaccine,, but it has taken them 8 months to get media flu scammed vaccine
1	It feels great to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
1/1	It feels like a good day to remind folks that vaccines work and vaccines save lives
1/1	It had been a hard year. It has been a challenging year. This vaccine is the best thing to come out of this year and can do the most to start our best defense for our future. Roll up your sleeves, fellow Americans, and take a brave step into a better future! Aloha
0/0	It had never been used and they skipped critical trials. Now people are dying.
1/-1	It hard to argue with crazy peaple Crazy means to ignore facts
0/0/0	It has Johnson in the name ...no thanks
1/1	It has a 94%+ efficacy rate in terms of preventing COVID completely, and 100% efficacy rate (based on this recent data) in preventing severe cases. The prior number alone is incredible for a vaccine.
1/1	It has always been emphasised that the vaccines would not stop people becoming infected with COVID 19 but that they would give protection against serious illness thus helping to minimise hospital admissions and reduce deaths. It seems sensible to remind everyone of this.
0/1	It has been reported that some of the side effects of the Oxfuurd, AstraZeneca vaccine are making normal citizens show alarming signs of ultra yooonyinism. An unknown source stated that watching bbc or sky news may also acutely further effect your ability to function normally.
1/-1	It has helped convince my wife to get the vaccine.
1/-1	It has killed people.
1/1	It has to be a safer option than getting Covid-19 and spreading it.
0/0	It hasn't even been a full year but yet there's already a vaccination for a virus that we know barely anything about out but there isn't a vaccination for a diseases that have been studied for years...
0/0	It honestly scares me
0/0	It is EXPERIMENTAL We should not be in such a rush to put all of our 'front line' people at a possible risk.
1/1	It is WAY more effective than no vaccine!
1/1	It is a blast! I got it yesterday and I am doing sports today with no side-effects! May God bless science.
0/0	It is a crime to force people to take your vaccine, set down in Nuremberg after WW2. And it‚Äôs a war crime that will put you in front of a military court. Look it up.
0/0/0	It is a pathogen! Dangerous!! This is not a TESTED vaccine. This will make millions for Gates, AMAZON. There are now different strains of the virus. Another democratic danger
1/1	It is a shame not to get vacciness now that we have them.some people ar soo ungreateful!
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	It is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
0/0	It is all a lie and a plan for the Cabal to take over the world. search and watch for Even 201. Bill Gates can take my shot.
0/0	It is all spare, you do not need a vaccine.
0/0	It is almost as if the Lobbyists themselves wrote the health care bill.
1/1/1/1	It is amazing that modern medicine is able to do this.
1/1	It is beyond any human logic that many people still comment that the deaths from Covid-19 are caused by the Flu and the vaccine. I totally support free speech but to leave comments like this in a news site is not only Trumpism but immoral. I demand action fron Administrators
0	It is common sense...when you inject something unnatural into your bloodstream, your bloodflow may be affected
0/0	It is criminal that these vaccination experiments are allowed to continue. Boris you will have blood on your hands if you don't stop them now.
1/1	It is done. 2nd jab. Completed mate
1/1	It is everyone's right to decide whether to get this vaccine. That being said, once its widely available I'm dropping the mask and I have no remorse for anyone who keels over due to the rona at that point. You made your choice.
1/1	It is exactly the same as any vaccination, yes there will be rare people who react to it badly! But because every body is different that is expected and cant be helped! If it works for the mass of the population then its good!
1/1	It is exciting to see the first successful vaccine... and there are 10+ vaccines by other companies right behind this one.
1/1	It is global issue, we have to act together. Good solidarity is needed among all regardless rich or poor countries. No one should be left behind. Vaccines should be for all, not only for the riches.
1/1	It is important that we have enough vaccine for everyone who needs it, as well as an ethical and equitable distribution strategy. We need both.
1/1	It is like a new filter or flu shot. Take one every 6 months. nobody complains about those.
1/1	It is necessary to vaccinate the vulnerable group of people as soon as possible.
0/1	It is normal to have certain reactions after a vaccination: There may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site
0/0	It is not a vaccine!!!!
0/0	It is not a vaxxxine but a SYNTHETIC PATHOGEN injection an ddeaths rocketred after injections started!? Heart attacks and strokes came back in fashion with doctors!? Are doctors falsifying health record/death certificates!?!?
0/0	It is of no benefit if you happen to be the one with the blood clots !
1/1	It is of the utmost importance that people understand that vaccines are the only way-out of this pandemic.
1/1	It is really work!!
1/1	It is recommended that you get vaccinated even if you have had covid-19.
1/1	It is safe and effective.
1/1	It is safe to get oxford/Astrazenca vaccination few weeks after recovering from Covid-19
1/1	It is strange that most anti vaxxers cannot pass high school chemistry and biology , yet they go around pretending to be smarter than scientists and doctors.
1/1	It is the amoral, anti-social, egocentric views of those turning down the vaccine that worry me.
1/1	It is the beginning of the end. Such relief. It makes me mentally feel better already
0/0	It is the flu and that is at a very low level so why more vaccines ?
0/0	It is the long term effects that are the problem. Tell us in a few months how glad you are you got it.
0/0	It is the result of so much misinformation. Why should we take a vaccin that has secrets? I am not against other vaccins, only this one.
1/1	It is totally reasonable that we should vaccinate the people that are regularly volunteering, both as a public health measure because they are in proximity to lots of people
1/1	It is true, vaccines are effective and it's normal to get side effects but that doesn't make them unsafe. They're also better than getting covid.
0/0	It is unclear how long an infected persons antibodies last, it is also unclear how long the vaccine lasts!! So why take the vaccine??
1/1	It is vitally important that we all work together to not only raise awareness and dispel misinformation about the #CovidVaccines, but also to help EVERYONE get vaccinated so that we can overcome this pandemic and heal as a nation and global community.
1/1	It is wonderful the new vaccine
0/0	It isnt safe and they know it but still push it putting money before health. People are dying around the world after having this untested ' cocktail and they are covering it up by not reporting the truth ! Just carrying on lying to the public its disgusting.

0/0	It just killed a perfectly healthy 38yr old woman the other day. I‚Äôm good taking my chances living free without the face control device and getting cancer or neurological problems down the road for your vax.
0/0	It just so happens I am one of those rare people who will react to any rare side affects!! So he can lie all he wants too!! I will refuse the shot until I die!! He is a ü§•ü§°
0/0	It kills 10% of the ppl taking it. It also disables 25% of the ppl. That's bad, not good.
0/-1	It kills people
1/1	It looks like I'm behind around 20 million or so. I'll get my vaccines the moment I am allowed to!
0/0	It looks like bottled piss.
0/0	It make it to where you are going to hell sorry I had to say it it‚Äôs the first step to the new world order and the mark of the beast
1/0	It makes me cry every time to hear children dying for something that the parents could have prevented.
0/-1	It may have side effects.
1/1	It might be helpful
1/1	It never ceases to amaze me how much correlation there seems to be between views as disparate as "vaccines are dangerous", "HCQ is effective against COVID", "wearing a mask is useless", and "news cases are caused by recent 'riots'". What could the latent variable be?
0/0	It never passed standard science checks and balances. In fact no corona vaccine has ever passed science; ever. Also no mRNA vax has ever passed basic science trials either.
0/0/0	It produces impotence. Watch out people.
1/1	It really frustrates me that the antivaxxers got way more time to speak and just ignored literally everything the doctor said
1/-1	It really pisses me off how many headlines I see each day begging me to take the vaccine. Fucking give me one! I'm the one begging for it ffs
0/0	It really saddens me to see this many ppl who dont mind getting repeated injections of the most harmful chemical's known to man. Wake up ppl!
0/0	It seems like everything about this vaccine is unclear, how did they manage to get approved so quickly? hmmm. did you all forget that we are all equipped with an immune system... take care of your body and it will take care of you
0/0	It seems like people don't know that they're being guinea pigs to the vaccine. The vaccine hasn't formally been approved yet, only authorized for emergency use. Even when it's formally approved, there's no guarantee of it being safe, as there's a lot of corruption.
0/0	It seems that this vaccine is on the dangerous side.
0/0	It seems to me reckless to be pushing people to take risks when you don‚Äôt know what the risks are.
0	It seems to me that for high risk of Covid categories the vaccine is a lower risk than Covid. However for the vast majority of the population for which the risk from Covid is tiny, or non existent the vaccine benefit risk equation is debatable to say the least
0/0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will have to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for permission to live a normal life.,
0/0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will need to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for the ability to live a normal life.
1/1	It should be a mandatory cause, the WHO could probably agree to do something in countries that enforces it.
1/1	It should be a mandatory vaccination drive, when it's about the collective good you don't want to take chances on anti-vax crowd
1/1	It should be free once it is released, it is for the benefit of the society, not individuals.
1/1	It should be noted that COVID-19 antivaxxers saying people died BECAUSE of the vaccine are the same ones saying that just because someone died having COVID-19 that DOESN‚ÄôT mean they died because of COVID-19!üßê
1/-1	It should be required
1/1	It should be required to refuse non-emergency medical treatment to any parent who refuses to vaccinate their child.
0/0	It shouldn't be mendatory
1/-1/-1	It shouldn't give anyone pause about whether the vaccine is safe or not
0/0	It sincerely bothers me to see them injecting the ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù in that kid, while he is being restrained by hands and also a car seat. The mother or father must have not properly read the consent form where it says ‚Äú I understand that the long term effects and complications are unknown at this time‚Äù. Infuriating.
0/0	It still fucks with your antibodys because of its interaction with your body's antibody system. I'm going to avoid covid and the covid shot, thanks
0/1	It sucks that the side effect of the covid 19 vaccine are worse than covid 19 side effects.
1/1	It sure will be. I get my 1st vaccine shot at 12:45. I am so excited. Stay safe and take care of each other.
1/0/-1	It takes a video like this to realize that at least half of the population is actually far dumber than you think.
0/0	It takes approximately 7 years to make a safe and available vaccine.
0/0	It turns you in to a flesh eating √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏√¢‚Ç¨ÔÜç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ÔÜè.
1/1	It varies a lot by socio-economic status and race. FWIW, I don‚Äôt know any anti-vaxxers either.
1/1	It was a privilege to be the @pfizerinc clinical trial. Thank you for a vaccine to help end the pandemic!!
1/1	It was a privilege to give out vaccines today. Proud of the #ucsd #covidvaccine effort at petco #padres! An amazing effort to get out the vaccine!
1/1	It was also found to be more than 94 per cent effective in people over the age of 65
0/-1	It was fast tracked. I will wait until 100% safe .
1	It was good. Tastes like mango. But it's not my favourite vaccine.
1/1	It was just recently approved in the UK though. Hopefully it goes well.
0/-1	It was never about a virus It was always about control
0/0	It was never about a virus It was always about control.
0/-1	It was never about the virus. But all about the vaccine. Why kill millions when you can just sterilize them?
0/0	It was not my anecdote... it was the doctors... the kid was paralyzed from the neck down after he was vaccinated and it was DUE to the vaccination But that is ok though right... just collateral damage attained in the never ending search for the perfect "herd" immunity during our march toward some retarded version of "progress". People like you are hopeless because you confuse memorizing skewed stats and industry jargon with actual intelligence and critical thinking ability. You think you know science, but it has more in common with a religion than it does actual science.
1/1	It was quick and painless. Make sure you all get it to protect your family, friends and your community! Thank you NHS
1/0	It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo.
0/0	It was the AstraZeneca shot that was causing blood clots.
0/0	It was the vaccine. We know he died from the vaccine!
0/0	It wasn't Covid that killed her. It was the vaccine. Sorry for your loss.
0/0	It wasnt untill i did my own research and found out that the vaccine is pure poison!!
0/0	It will be a whole country that will have a Bill Gates micro chip in them by May. That should make Bill happy.
1/1	It will be great to have medical personnel vaccinated after all of these stressful months. Science saves!
0/0	It will change our dna...I refuse a doctor in florida died after getting it and iv heard of alot of deaths. .their trying to do population control that's us...scary... but I'm right with lord so I pray others wake up God bless
0/0	It will edit you genes, put new thoughts in your head, and destroy your body. i choose fema camp over covid vaccine anyday. Repeating a lie big enough does not work on me. wamp, wamp.
1/1	It will help more or less
0/0	It will kill more than the viras.
0/-1	It will only take one of these variants to be able to 'get around' the immune response activated by the current vaccines, and the whole process will begin again from 'square one'. I think that is what is going to happen so they will have to constantly keep modifying the vaccines. It will mean years of lockdowns, masks, etc. What is really needed is a 'silver bullet' antiviral drug that knocks out the coronavirus type regardless of chemical structural changes in the spike protein. Vaccines are inherently unreliable in a population of genetically altering viruses.

1/1	It will prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines
0/0	It will probably give you syphilis
1	It will protect me after injection.
1/1	It will stop you killing people by passing it on and might save you too if you catch it - is that good enough for you
1/1	It will take time to vaccinate enough people and this assuming that they will accept to get the vaccine. Bottom line it' s still a rocky ride keep the belt fasten for 5 months
0/1	It won't end because of the vaccine, herd immunity is the way we go back to normal. Not the new normal. The Wuhan virus will probably be around just like all the other flu's, only there won't be lockdowns. It was a test and is still in progress.
0/0	It won‚Äôt even prevent transmissions so it‚Äôs safer and more effective to just get the virus and develop immunity.
1/1	It worries me that people would rather listen to conspiracy theorists than actual doctors and scientists about the Covid vaccine
0/1	It would be great if our former president would do a PSA saying the Covid-19 vaccines are safe.
1/1	It would be great if the city had more appt. only vaccine clinics vs. the mass vaccination clinics without appointments. Most people are working and can't wait around for hours to get the vaccine. An appt. would allow people to schedule time off from work to get their vaccine.
1/-1/-1	It would be great if you specified which variant you are cofidently referring to in regaurds to efficacy. Because now it has been proven thise numbers only apply to the original strain, not the variants.
0/-1	It would be hard for me to access one.
1/1	It would be nice if they were available.
1/-1	It would help put this in perspective if articles listed total number of covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in same time period. Compare infections in overall population to vaccinated population. And note how many infections and deaths were prevented by vaccines.
0/0	It wouldn't be worth the risk to me. If one in a thousand could react to the point of death; would you be willing to take that chance? Not me.
1/1	It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to draw back in any case. I‚Äôm going to make sure they do for my second shot of Pfizer too.
0/1	It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever get a vaccine especially from the government
1/1/1/1	It'll be such a relief hearing people are getting the vaccine.. even if it's slow at first, it'll be great to get some good news.
1/1	It'll protect us FOREVER!
0/0	It's A Death Shot Period!!
0	It's ALL part of the bullshit show.. This pandemic was intentionally released by our own Government to kill off the elderly and poor/ low income people so they won't have to pay out unemployment, or disability or social security or medical fees.. killing off the people with weakened immune systems. There are too many people in the world. This is a way of taking care of that issue. It was made in a lab, and it got too out of control.
0/0	It's Abit cringworthy doing this if you ask me no one does it for the flu Vaccine
0/0	It's NEW technology, so it's impossible to know the long term side effects .. For example a year from now, or 5 years from now .. NO THANK YOU, I WON'T TAKE THE SHOT .. Obviously Many Doctors (some not even real Doctors) will be shills and promote the vaccine ..
1/-1	It's a Miracle!!! üòè
1/1	It's a blast! I got it yesterday and I am doing sports today with no side-effects! May God bless science.,
1/1	It's a good thing that the medical staff have been done first, as they were in the front line of the virus
0/0	It's a lethal doctrine. 85 of the world's poorest countries are unlikely to get widespread access to vaccines until 2023: that's two more years for the virus to mutate into deadlier variations and re-infect people whose vaccinations have worn off.
0/0/0/0	It's a lethal injection. It's killing people
0/0	It's a medical mery-go-round. And lots of $$$ for pharma from now into forever...
1/1	It's a no brainer to take the vaccine
0/0	It's a no for me. however, let's not shame others for wanting to get the vaccine. It's all about choice at the end of the day.
0/0	It's a pity we can't get a vaccine against the BBC misinformation.
0/0	It's a poison not a vaccine
0/0	It's a simple analysis of risk-reward ratio. I'm young, healthy with no underlying health conditions. I don't want the covid vax as I consider it unnecessary and there's a potential element of risk.
1/1	It's acceptable to have a healthy dose of skepticism for anything, however I trust the doctors, researchers, and everyone who had hands on developing this more than a random tin-foil hat wearing youtuber saying it'll turn me into a gay frog.
1/1	It's actually good for low risk high activity people to get vaccinated because they can easily spread the virus and not know.
0/0	It's against my doctrine to take vaccine.
0/0	It's all a loads of wank no vaccine is not gonna stop the spend of covid it's out of control
1/1	It's all about supply where I live. Get it moving please. Folks are ready to put shots in arms.
1/1/1	It's all in the numbers: Chances of getting severly ill from covid 19 > Having a severe reaction to the vax
0/0	It's all lies .just normal winter flu I don't need no vaccine .my immune system will protect me .
0/-1	It's all so crazy. Funny how most people still believe this charade
1/-1	It's all we have at present. No doubt future vaccines will change just as the virus changes.
0/0	It's alot to sort out for sure. I just saw 11 people were hospitalized in Denver last week after they got the JJ vaccine and were sickened
1	It's already February. First mRNA vaccinations outside a clinical trial started about 8 weeks ago (UK). Since then million of doses have been administered. Looking at data and reports of side-effects etc., I'd call it a great success.
0/0	It's amazing how a vaccine can be made in a couple of weeks for a new variant, I smell bullshit
1/1	It's amazing how many people know more than scientist good luck
0/0	It's amazing how people are so willing to get something that They're unsure if it's even going to work
1/1	It's amazing how they simplify the explanation of the research about creation of the vaccine. Thanks for letting us, laymen, understand complex science stuffs.
0/0	It's an EXPERIMENT and ALL side effects from this vaccine are NOT yet known
0/0	It's an EXPERIMENT and ALL side effects from this vaccine are NOT yet known,( which could take up to 2 yrs to know) and that should have been stated in this video, not to mention the known side affects
0/0	It's an agenda. They're going to release an updated version.
0/0	It's an experimental Bio many are dying .
0/0	It's an inadequately tested poison! No one will vaccinate me and my family members with these Satanic poisons, in shah Allah. It's a recipe for autoimmune diseases!
0/0	It's at month seven we will turn into zombies
0/0	It's awful how people that are choosing to get the jab are so vocal to those of us who are choosing to not. Just wrong!!!!
1/1	It's been 4 days since I got my first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, haven't had any distinct side effects but Pfizer ads keep popping up across all my socials
0/0	It's been a year already give it up. You want the Jab by all means take it. I'm good without it.
1/1	It's better that someone gets vaccinated rather than the vaccine spoil..
0/0	It's better to take chances of survival with corona than this vaccine
1/1	It's comforting to know that there are so many really smart people out there working to solve hard problems like this
0/0	It's dangerous as it hasn't been properly tested on humans and rushed through, also as a Christian I don't believe in putting drugs into my body
0/0	It's experimental, it's not like any normal vaccine it's reasonable to be hesitant. And when you don't have transparency you wind up with conspiracies, shutting down criticism is only going to fuel the fire and make trust worse.
0/0	It's funny how the rationale used to explain away the deaths of those who are vaccinated was not sufficient to explain the deaths that occurred before the vaccine was issued .... every death was said to be from covid ... now it's any death of a vaccinated person is for anything but the vaccine. All of a sudden prexisting health conditions are the causes of death.. I know that you realize this inconsistency as you speak Doctor.
1/1	It's going to annoy the remain goons but the AZ Oxford vaccine will be the workhorse vaccine of the global pandemic.....
0/0	It's going to turns us all into aliennnnnnnssssssss!
1/1	It's good to see outlying countries are being vaccinated too.
1/1	It's great that states are taking advantage of large arenas to get a lot people vaccinated at one time.
1/1	It's great to see vaccines around now i take this opportunity to thank all the doctors who contributed in anyway to get at this point. God bless you all.
1/1	It's hard to have an intelligent and informative conversation with anti-vaxxers. It really is. Because their side is ridiculous.
1/1	It's hard to win an argument against an intelligent person but impossible to win against a dumb one
1/1	It's idiotic to believe that if others are vaccinated then you are protected. If you're are scared of covid-19, get the vaccine, you should be protected, even if others didn't get the vaccine. AND IF your NOT protected and you get covid after getting the vaccine, then that means the vaccine DOESN'T WORK. Makes sense to me. If you truly believe everyone needs to have it, for YOU to be safe, you're basically a DICTATOR who cares NOTHING of the population.
0/-1	It's important to be open about the information of vaccines all.
1	It's incredibly refreshing to see a comment section that is not full of anti vaxx bs . Thank yall for being sane
1/1	It's interesting how they think it's their "right" not to take the vaccine, while at the same time arguing that others should not have the right to protect themselves from the virus. They argue against mask mandates and social distancing measures, but reject the one thing that could end these requirements.
1/1	It's interesting that RNA vaccines can just be tweaked to rapidly adjust for mutations. Thank you science
1/-1	It's interesting to read the formulation of Covishield, Covaxin & Sputnik V. All different in concept & making
0/0	It's just a life-threatening Vaxxine!
1/-1/1	It's just an incentive to get the skeptics vaccinated. I feel they should have waited to say this when most of the country has already been vaccinated. Better safe than sorry. RT @aaronecarroll: But there's a small chance that you could still get infected and.... Stop. Just go get vaccinated. As fast as you can. RT @Sites4Congress: @sabrinaeaton @Jim_Jordan Jim Jordan's voted against free testing. Against free vaccinations. Against the financial r‚Ä¶ RT @aaronecarroll: But what about new variants and is it as effective against those and what about the future and... Stop. Just go get v‚Ä¶
1/-1	It's just truly depressing how many people who need to see this won't, and of those that do see this how many will just ignore it.
1/1	It's kinda sad how the countries that paid the least attention to the pandemic, downplaying and ignoring it, get the vaccines first, while the rest of the world sits and waits. Goes to show how shitty the world is
1/1	It's like a paradox. I have no issue getting a vaccine for COVID. However, government mandated vaccines (or even just marking people who have received the vaccine on their health card or whatever) screams totalitarianism. Makes me uneasy. I got COVID many weeks ago though, so it looks like I won't need one anyway since I've got all those good antibodies now. Good poll.
1/1/1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
1/1	It's like driving a car and NOT wearing your seatbelt. Can a seatbelt cut into your stomach or damage your neck im an accident? Ofc....but i'd rather wear it and possibly have that happen than have an accident and fly through a windscreen. Prevention is better than cure.
0/-1	It's like playing Russian roulette...NO THANK YOU!
0/-1	It's like taking candy from a stranger.
0/0	It's like you forgetting that people go retarded because of vaccination, and people dying from complications from vaccinations. How come deaths matter only when it suits you?
0/0	It's more a question of knowing too much about corruption at government and big pharma level
0/0	It's more benficial to keep you sick and alive, than cure you. I won't buy their game
1/-1	It's not "plans" when it happens months too late; it's just finally doing something you already should've done -- if necessary, by pressuring Tr*mp's government to help.
1/1	It's not 100% success but let us hope and pray for good results
0/0	It's not Vaccine hesitancy. They are labeling it incorrectly. It's literally government distrust
0/0	It's not a vaccine and you know it. So why lie? It's an experiment using genetic manipulation that has never been proved effective. All the animals tested died when they were infected with a real corona virus. Animal abuse is also unethical.
0/-1	It's not a vaccine if it doesn't stop transmission or infection. It's not registered as a vaccine its gene therapy.Controllavirus.
0/0	It's not a vaccine is it? A gene-editing nano biotech injection would be a more accurate description.
0/0	It's not a vaccine it's an e xperimental biological mRNA gene therapy that will alter you, wake up people !!!!
0/0	It's not a vaccine! It's an experiment with no legal consequences.
0/0	It's not a vaccine, it's experimental gene therapy.
0/0	It's not a vaccine, it's gene therapy, per their patents?
0/0/0	It's not a vaccine, its a planet wide experimental treatment. Just because you change the definitions doesn't make it true. Microchip- ..... Change genetics.....it does (temporarily?) hijack your cellular machinery to replicate 30k-50k human sample size which only is few months old does not equal safety for whole planet ya rhetards Last mrna trial on rats killed them all due to immunization priming. Longterm side effects of experimental crap vs 99.99% - 97%. Not hard to choose. Sars2 has yet to be proven to exist. PHUCK THE COLLECTIVE. You are no real doctor.
0/0	It's not a vaccine. It cannot be mandated. The immune system is more effective than any vaccine.. with no side effects. Healthy people are healthy people. They need no treatment. And get a better test as the PCR is not a valid diagnostic tool, according to the man who created it.
0/0	It's not a vaccine. It's gene manipulation therapy. Remember what happened when monsanto gmo'd corn?
0/0	It's not a vaccine...it's a human clinical drug trial and you are guinea pigs. Once you've had it you might be lucky enough to have no side effects however most people have and sadly some have died. This doesn't stop you from getting covid at all. It's a DNA changer. Folks you are being duped into thinking you are doing a kind gesture to save you and your family.
1/1	It's not about completely preventing it. It's about reducing the impact. Even if you're unlucky enough to still catch it with the vaccine, you almost certainly won't require hospitalization.
0/0	It's not agreeing to vaccine, it's agreeing to "die"!
0/0	It's not anti vax, it is pro freedom which the jab seems to be ignoring
0/-1	It's not even a vaccine, it's gene therapy.
1/1	It's not even approved for daily use it's just emergency use only, nobody is forcing your lazy a** to get up to go to a hospital to help everyone out
1/0	It's not going to re-write my DNA and make me into a chimera? Darn, I wanted to become a centaur! X-D
0/0	It's not just this one death. Read the comments. There are others who have died from a recent vaccine.
1/1	It's not surprising. There is hardly any other advocacy group as easily agitated as the antivaxxers. Just tweet a provaccine message and a barrage of angry responses arrives instantaneously.
0/0	It's not that effective.... At least, latest data shows.
0/0	It's not that we don't need a vaccine (we have an immune system ......hello) we SHOULDN'T BE TAKING VACCINES PERIOD !!!
0/0	It's official a friend of mine sister took the injection 2 weeks ago now she's dead note she was in perfect health and pressured into it by her job she leaves behind three beautiful children and a loving husband
1/1	It's official! I'm officially fully vaccinated! It feels great to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
0/0	It's ok to want autonomy over your own body. That isn't a conspiracy.
1/1	It's only fair to give the extra vaccine doses to other countries who really need them.
0/0	It's perfectly safe!..........Famous last words of EVERYONE on the Titanic also!
0/0	It's poison. Wake up America. I don't get any vaccinations and neither do my kids and we're are fine. They put stuff that kills you slowly
1/1	It's pretty fucking good, it means that hospitals will no longer be swamped with covid cases and barely anyone will be dying, so we can go back to our normal lives
1/1	It's really dumb when people do "oh well I won't take vaccines, there is a chance that it could hurt my child" and then they give their child medicine that has the same chances for bad reactions, and bad side effects.
0/0	It's really harmful ecause it's not natural , it kills human
0/0	It's sad I watched the movie and I can't trust anything the CDC says anymore.
1/1	It's sad to see some people believe that vaccines don't work
1/1	It's safe and it's the only way to stop covid.
0/0/0	It's safe as long as you can't sue them.
1/1	It's safe for you to be vaccinated if you're trying to conceive or would like to have a child in the future. No evidence exists to suggest that Covid vaccines cause fertility problems.
0/0	It's scary that we are putting vaccine in so many people when it was developed so recently and we don't know what the long-term implications are.
0/0	It's so deadly you have to get tested to know you have it
1/-1	It's so easy to forget how incredibly smart humanity is until you get reminded of it by such great feats of technology, innovaton, and science.
0/0	It's so effective that it didn't even have to be approved...
0/0	It's still experimental..they don't know this positivity.
1/1	It's stupid conspiracy theorists that are resisting it so the government has no choice but to persuade them to
0/0	It's such a relief knowing that I won't have to worry about any of this either in the short-term or long-term because I am not taking any of this poison
0/0	It's the beginning of the end of Freedom . Screw the vaccine .
1/1	It's the beginning of the end, boys! I know this might've been said tens of thousands of times but for a pandemic virus we knew nothing about in January, a working vaccine being shipped 11 months later is a truly extraordinary feat.
1/-1	It's the being 12 months into a pandemic and still having people who refuse to wear a mask to protect their/others' lives for me.
1/1	It's the best thing ever happening to me!
0/0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most.
1/1	It's the only way it will one day disappear this virus once and for all, so let's all get ready and get vaccinated!!
0/0/0	It's the vaccine. So many people are dying & most have bad side affects (sic). Its (sic) a man made (sic) virus & all involved including the WHO UN WEF should all be charged with genocide
0/0	It's true that there isn't evidence of a pandemic.
1/1	It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time, but that's not because they were rushed. It's because of careful preparation. The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation. The pandemic is an emergency situation which required emergency response but that does not mean the companies bypassed safety protocols or performed inadequate testing. In addition to the safety review by the FDA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization has convened a panel of vaccine safety experts to independently evaluate the safety data from the clinical trial. The safety of COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be closely monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA, so overall, you should definitely get the vaccine as soon as possible because it is SAFE and much more beneficial for your health.
0/-1	It's truly amazing to me how many people are willingly going to lineup to get the equivalent of a blue tattoo.
1/1	It's unbelivable how they think they are more smart, how they think they are special cause they feel they know something that others don't, they feel some kinda of superiority, like they understand more than the specilists and cientists.
1/1	It's useless trying to talk rationally with these anti-vaxxers. They're in their own paranoid world where imaginary evil powers are conniving to harm us all and any proof brought against their theories is considered evidence of just how insidious these evil powers are.
0/0	It's very comforting to read the comments, and see the resistance!
1/1	It's very hard to get an appointment right now. Guess I'll have to wait...
1/1	It's very strange to find that many of the same people who promoted "herd immunity" when it meant killing hundreds of thousands of people by leaving the virus free to rip through the population are now dead set against herd immunity done properly with a vaccine which could save tens of thousands of lives.
1/1	It's your choice of course, but only the vaccine will allow you to return to a normal(ish) life. All the supplements in the world won't stop some illnesses getting through.
0/0	Italy are going to jail bill gates I hope once this starts they all get jailed and forced to have the death jab
1/1	Italy should ban antivaxx parents from work. poor kids always on the shitty end. no vaccines, no health care, everybody looks at you funny, and now you can't get an education because your parents are dumb as rocks.
1/1/1	Its 100% safe
0/0	Its BILL GATES money vaccine! RIP
0/0	Its a NO from me
1/1	Its a good job we all don‚Äôt think like you or some of the deadliest diseases would still be around so many to name it would take me to long to list them all
1/0	Its a human right to reject any form of foreign body been injected into your arm. I'm pro vaccine but I respect people's opinions and choices because.... aren't we free ?
0/0	Its all a government population control system. This fake ass vaccine is a way for the government to track people
1/1	Its all about herd immunity.
1/-1	Its all about time, that's definitely plays a roll here, think & stay positive keep you're faith & Hope Alive, if people just do their part right now. . that is continue to wearing you'reüò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑ very too early to make sure we're gonna all be back to life/ reality, normal daily activities of living healthy without the covid-19 forget we are what we eat to, eat healthy, exercise,
1/-1	Its also not like they can manufacture all the vaccines at once, so why would I want to be the first to get it when I'm in the lowest risk group. Way rather wait for later batches and get the added bonus of seeing any potential side effects.
0/0	Its banned not approved by FDA, USA and many European countries. Not sure how much company paying Dr. Tam her team and other PR Doc.
0/0	Its based on individual choice. I'm not taking it either...nor are anyone I know and love. And no amount of shaming or explanations will change that. And for the record ...all i know have Masters degrees. Again its based on individual choice.
1/1	Its been clear for a while it works and will help us out of the pandemic... Not sure why some many countries have concerns - its simple get on and vaccinate - save your health systems and lives.. Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow - could get sick/die from anything - rather have the vaccine and hope can have some form of life again...
0/0	Its been proven that the first round or so of a vaccine has a higher risk of major complications due to lack of knowledge of the side effects. And these being pushed out so quickly with very little testing is scary. No telling what the long term effects of a rushed vaccine will be
0/0/0	Its definitely a no for me.
0/0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
1/1/1	Its fine, let those anti vaxxers catch the whooping cough and see how they like it lol
0/-1	Its funny how its because of an underlying problem "but" would have never happened if he had not taken vaccine
1/1	Its funny how people with no knowledge about biology tries to say why you shouldn't take the vaccine
0/0	Its going to happen dude there going to turn humanity into cyborgs avoid the vax and microchips dude.
1/1/1/1	Its gonna be great watching the graphs of continued infections and when the vaccine hits seeing those rates start to fall. Then the real fun will start with the anti vaxxers doing everything they can to explain away why rates start to fall as soon as the vaxx hits.
1	Its good that sputnik v uses different vectors but the protein produced will be same (spike proteins). So will the antibodies already present in the body due to first dose not attack the second virus again. This can reduce the efficacy.
1/1	Its important to note that 1 in 25000 will still lead to alot of death counts but its STILL safer than covid wich has a 3 in 100 death rate. Dont get discouraged by deaths due to vaccines as they are literally miniscule compared to pandemic threat right now.
0/0	Its like people don;t understand that a corona virus is highly mutative, and none of the vaccines will even matter in a few months.
0/-1	Its mark of the beast now in play...thank u america..lord please take care of all the believers and get the ones that dont believe to believe
0/0/0/0	Its never been a "vaccine", it's genetic engineering.
1/1	Its nice knowing how close we are to defeating this pandemic! :)
0/-1	Its not about a virus and the sooner people realise that the better but sadly most of the population is still brainwashed and paralyzed with fear. I see them in the shops with their little masks and want to shake them to wake up
1/-1	Its not correct- the Russian Sputnik V contains no Covid19Virus parts but is on the basis of the human adenovirus...So its acceptable and possible w/o ingeneered mRNA
0/0	Its not just a vaccine, next comes your health passport. Then yearly vaccines to keep your health passport valid and to keep up with changing strains. Then it will be drugs to combat the conditions caused by the vaccines. Then more drugs to combat the side effects of the other drugs. Follow the money trail.
1/-1	Its not painless getting the vaccine it just painful trying to get an appointment to get the vaccine. Its horrible that we have to almost beg to get it. Been trying with no luck.
1/1	Its not that bad. Just got my second shot. I had fever, chills, and aches for 24 hours. Then felt better
0/0	Its ok to kill people with vaccine... Its totally ok !!! We wont tell you what are the long term sideeffect....!!
1/1	Its really reassuring that all of the vaccines work and are effective!
1/1	Its sad how vaccines have done such a good job of protecting people from deadly diseases worldwide that people have actually been led to believe these diseases are actually harmless. Vaccines cause anti-vaxxers.
1/-1	Its sad this needs to be stated, but thank you for informing people about the facts.
1/1	Its so hard to choose between a 3% chance of death and a 0.0001% chance of death
0/-1	Its so sad that people in the so-called developed world leave their patents and grand patents in elderly facilities and let the government just get rid of them
0/0	Its that same people calling everybody Nazis yet demanding that we all carry our "papers".
0/0	Its the lies by media which cause outrage . The vaccine cures nothing . They say it simply prevents hospitL requirements. Don't say conspiracy theorists A LARGE number of VIRAL EXPERTS SAY and up until 2020 insisted lockdowns always helped the spread . Mask wearing helped the spread . BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY if loom at death breakdowns . Percentage wise UK has less deaths this year than a lot of previous last 20 years . Why was a meeting held 3 months before first vivid case to dis uss vaccine . Why was WHO exec in wuhan describing in Nov 19 how they were actually working on civid new strains then wrote a report for fauchi and WHO stating was a conspiracy theory . Then the actually tape of him that was released on YouTube before first case was discovered turned up this month . So was fact not conspiracy bill Gates talking of covid 21 in Feb this year on American TV due to new strain wtf then Hungary who have vaccinated thd highest percentage of population are now in the midst of worse death amounts since( outbreak) began why is common sense far from common why bother with vaccine when apparently new strains keep turning up . Its a joke
0/0	Its the metals theyre putting in the vaccines that are killing people.
0/0	Its the natural infection that's going to end the pandemic and not the vaccine... already over 60% population have natural immunity across some countries and approaching herd immunity via natural infections... but the credit will go to the vaccine...
1/1	It‚Äôs 95% effective, so there is still a small possibility that you get the coronavirus and spread it to others. What really is important is that once you take the vaccine, it‚Äôs pretty much impossible for you to die from the virus (it will never get severe). So in essence, you are well protected even if u do get sick.
0/0	It‚Äôs So Unbelievable how people believe these devils telling you that THE POISON they are injecting in you is a vaccine.
1	It‚Äôs a beautiful day for a second dose! #vaccinated #Grateful
1/1/1/1	It‚Äôs a clear choice ......catch Covid and you could actually die or get vaccinated and their is an extremely rare chance of a side effect leading to death. The world is filling up with WOKE pussy‚Äôs suffering from breast milk withdrawal symptoms!
1	It‚Äôs a good day. 1st shot for my dad who turns 80 in just a few weeks. Feeling so damn grateful for science
1/1	It‚Äôs a great idea to urge to get vaccinated against COVID-19. That‚Äôs the only way to return to normality.
0/0	It‚Äôs a novel MOA and a rushed vaccine. We‚Äôve also been lied to multiple times about covid with the WHO, Fauchi and the media. No one has any business forcing someone to get a vaccine like this. I‚Äôm going to wait for the studies and additional data around the vaccine before getting it
1/-1/1	It‚Äôs a pandemic we need to be vaccinating poorer countries
1/0	It‚Äôs a physicians legal job to encourage ppl to get vaccinated. Doesn‚Äôt mean he actually got vaccinated...there are so many ppl lying about receiving the vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôs a virus. So it‚Äôs like a flu shot. no1 complains about those. just take the vaccine ppl!
1/1	It‚Äôs about protecting people that can‚Äôt take the vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôs actually unconscionable to NOT get vaccinated. IMO, professional malpractice.
1/1	It‚Äôs all about weighing risk and benefit. Right now, the risk of serious COVID-19 infection = significantly worse than the risk of major vaccine side effects. Please accept the first #CovidVaccine you are offered!
0/0	It‚Äôs all ready caused deaths weeks after being injected with that poison.
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing 100k people have potentially died from the Covid vaccine and they just keep giving it out.
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing how fast the vaccine came out. Other vaccines take YEARS before the are passed by the FDA. The virus was altered to what it is now and has mutated at least once. The vaccine will not do anything for you. But you will not see these results in the MSM.
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing how fast this got approved versus other vaccines. We need it
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it how happy it makes you feel. Both my parents got vaccinated yesterday
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing that for a experimental vaccine, never used before, Pfizer knows every possible side effect (and death is not one of them)
1/-1	It‚Äôs amazing what can be done when they actually ‚Äúthrow money at it‚Äù imagine what they can accomplish if they did this with everything instead of trying to gain money to be rich
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing what engineering and science is capable of these days. Hats off to everyone who probably worked 24/7 on the development and manufacturing of this vaccine.
0/0	It‚Äôs an experiment on gullible humans
0/0	It‚Äôs an experiment! Thank Bill Gates! Think Eugenics! Think Vaccines!
0/0	It‚Äôs an experimental treatment. People will get sick and some will die, as YOU are the experiment.
0/0	It‚Äôs as effective as a diet...
1/0	It‚Äôs bad enough him and his oppos talking out of their ****s to the detriment of their citizens but the ongoing issue of confidence in what has now been proven to be an effective vaccine will no doubt have a fatal knock on effect. Shameful excuses for leaders.
1/1	It‚Äôs better than nothing. I would take it if it was my only choice.
1/1/1/1	It‚Äôs breaking my heart, my autistic 9 year old just wants to go play basketball with his friend down the road, and I can‚Äôt risk letting him (his mother and I have weak lungs). We need these vaccines so bad....
0/0	It‚Äôs disgusting that these companies are protected from being pursued for any wrongdoing. There‚Äôs no justice in this world. I wouldn‚Äôt touch big pharma‚Äôs vaccine with a ten foot pole.
0/0	It‚Äôs experimental gene therapy. Not a vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôs funny how anti vax moms think they are smarter than the doctors who‚Äôve had years of training where the moms probably had 5 minutes of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù
1/1	It‚Äôs funny most people took so many drugs when they were younger and now they are worried about what‚Äôs in the vaccine
0/0	It‚Äôs garbage. A scam for the taxpayer. It causes paralyzation and gonnorhea.
0/0	It‚Äôs going backfire this sinister reset in cabal faces
0/0	It‚Äôs gonna be like I am Legend we‚Äôre all going to turn into vampires
1/1	It‚Äôs gonna suck if we‚Äôre still on lockdown in a year, because people refuse to get it. Its the only way out of this.
1/-1	It‚Äôs honestly sad just looking at how many people think they‚Äôre smarter than doctors, just because they looked at the internet for 10 minutes. Seriously, Antivaxxers have a pretty similar mindset to Flat earthers.
1/1	It‚Äôs honestly so nice that Dr. Mike is ACTUALLY trying to help these anti-vaxxers stop being so stupid. They aren‚Äôt bad people necessarily, my mom is one. I love her a lot, but, she needs to stop wearing a tinfoil hat and wake up.
1/1	It‚Äôs incredible to go from ‚Äúworst infection day‚Äù to ‚Äúhighest vaccinated in a day‚Äù in the same week.
1/1	It‚Äôs ironic that the people who are afraid of a vaccine, something that saves lives, are often the same ones claiming that they‚Äôre not at all afraid of assault rifles and other firearms, things that snuff out and destroy lives.
1/1	It‚Äôs irresponsible not too
1/1/1	It‚Äôs kind of amazing how much misinformation and fear mongering surrounds this vaccine. Seriously, this is all stuff you learn in a high school biology class.
1/1	It‚Äôs mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.
1/-1	It‚Äôs never gonna stop, people poisoning other people‚Äôs minds, sickos!!!!
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine at all, it‚Äôs a dangerous experimental gene therapy
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine it‚Äôs an experimental treatment
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It‚Äôs an experimental pathogenic priming program.
1/1	It‚Äôs not about doing it for your country. It‚Äôs about doing it for your family and to get things back to normal.
0	It‚Äôs not anti vaccines it‚Äôs that we have woke the hell up to your plans
1/1	It‚Äôs not bad, got a lot of chills,
1/1	It‚Äôs not difficult to work this out pal. In every age/ risk category you are safer with the vaccine than without
0/0	It‚Äôs not safe for anyone
1/1	It‚Äôs okay to be anti vaccine, it is just the natural selection of our time.
1/1	It‚Äôs plain old Darwinism if they don‚Äôt vaccinate.
1/-1	It‚Äôs really funny how these people in comment section know more than the doctors.
1/1	It‚Äôs really not sad. Most people I know in NY are practically turning handsprings that they got vaccinated. Just really excited and happy! It‚Äôs a game changer
0/1	It‚Äôs safe but the manufacturers have zero liability
1/1	It‚Äôs second #coronavirus vaccine dose day for me in #Beijing! Woohoo! #China
0/-1	It‚Äôs simple , the vaccine has NOT gone through the proper Test , there has Not been enough time to do so , it‚Äôs actually impossible to say the vaccine has been scientifically tested and that‚Äôs a FACT ! So keep your hateful gas lighting attacks to yourself .
1/1	It‚Äôs simple, make vaccinations mandatory for everyone! no one allowed back to work, school, flights etc without a valid vaccination certificate! This is how you defeat this disease!
0/0	It‚Äôs simply that it‚Äôs just to early and experimental.
0/-1	It‚Äôs so obvious.
0/-1	It‚Äôs staggering to see how many people are completely brainwashed -
0/0	It‚Äôs still very experimental and we are the guinea pigs! Well not me I will never take any vaccine for corona virus.
1/0	It‚Äôs super weird to me because it seems like the same people who were saying ‚Äú99 percent chance of survival‚Äù are also the same people referencing the small amount of people who had adverse reactions to the vaccine.
0/0	It‚Äôs the children they are coming for next, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about, this could make them sterile, hence depopulation.
0/0	It‚Äôs the long term effects, and when the elite wish to reduce populations I think I will give it a miss
1/0	It‚Äôs the needle for me
0	It‚Äôs the rapture! All of the good people that took the vaccine will die. The sinners will be left behind. It‚Äôs just like the Kirk Cameron movies. I pray you all find Jesus.
1/1	It‚Äôs time to start giving out Pfizer and a Moderna shots as a one time with plan to get the boost 3-6 months later, instead of 3 weeks, to maximize the number of people vaccinated and save more lives.
0/0	It‚Äôs untested & unsafe. We all know this except the media & their government masters.
1/1	It‚Äôs very good. There‚Äôs so much to do with it. Now... to get vaccines and be able to go out in the world with it. Can‚Äôt wait!
0/0	It‚Äôs very simple why they don‚Äôt want it dude.... it‚Äôs their body end off and you are not entitled to their body
1/0	It‚Äôs weird how when a virus has a 3% chance of death, people go ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not that serious, the chance of you dying is only 3% why you taking it so seriously?‚Äù But when a vaccine has a 5% chance of either not working or has adverse side effects (not even a 5% chance of death, just side effects) people go ‚ÄúNO THE VACCINE BAD!! TOO DANGEROUS! I DONT TRUST IT!‚Äù
1/1/1	It‚Äôs weird that the same people who think covid deaths have no statistical significance, are upset about the .00000001 % who may have had a blood clot due to the J&J vaccine. #GetVaccinated
1/1	It‚Äôs weird, vaccines have done their job so well that there are people who are likely alive from them denouncing them
0/-1	Ive got my baseball bat ready if they come to my door
0/0	Ive had covid. Vitamin D3 treats the symptoms, like blood clotting and cytokine storm. Do NOT take the vaccine, friend.
0/0	Ivermectin + Vit D + Vit C + Zinc + Selenium + Quercetin = a safe and cheap prevention option.
1/1	Ivermectin is not a proper cure for Covid-19. There is no cure for the virus, the only effective and well-tested solution are covid-19 vaccines.
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll wait a year- let me see what happens to all the guinne pigs first
1/1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the military and have had the vaccine, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been over a week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fine.√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not getting it
0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taking the vaccine. I have a history of having a very bad allergic reaction to all or most vaccines. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had seizers from getting vaccines, gotten diabetes, and many other unpleasant things have happened to me due to a bad reaction to vaccines. I think people who are not affected in a fatal way by vaccines should get them if they want to. But if your doctor tells you √¢‚Ç¨≈ì don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s killing you or you have a extremely bad reaction to it√¢‚Ç¨¬ù . Then don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it.
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m over 50, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a firm No from me.
1/1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had the vaccine last week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze
0/0	I‚Äòd say there is a genuine reason for people to distrust governments that have continuously lied and been corrupt for decades upon decades
1/1/1/1	I‚Äòll get it once it becomes available
1/1	I‚Äòve got my biontech vaccine today, thank you for explaining üíâ
0/1	I‚Äôd be more likely to take it if the media told me not to, with their track record
0/0	I‚Äôd hate to be a kid right now with no knowledge of vaccines and my parents end up getting me a Covid shot. I‚Äôd be sick knowing what I know now!

0/0	I‚Äôd rather listen to this guy than Bill Gates who knows nothing.
0/0	I‚Äôd rather play it safe personally, nothing wrong with being precautious. I already live a loner life and work alone so I‚Äôm not exposed or exposing and I don‚Äôt care to see family so, what‚Äôs there to lose in waiting to see the results?
0/1	I‚Äôd rather wear a mask than take that
1/1	I‚Äôd really like to know where these fucking vaccines are. My mom is 70, has cancer, and I‚Äôve got her on every list in my area and she is STILL waiting.
1/1	I‚Äôd trust a person with 8 years of high level medical schooling vs an internet article from an unknown source
0/0	I‚Äôll Rather Die From The Fake Coronavirus Than Satanic Vaccine!
0/0	I‚Äôll allow someone more needy to have my dose, the virus is 99%+ recoverable, I‚Äôm not worried,at all, and I‚Äôm immune compromised, help yourself to mine, too many people have died or had VERY negative side affects, good luck to you.
1/1	I‚Äôll be getting my vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôll be happy with letting the more vulnerable ones, and essential workers, getting priority for vaccinations
1/1	I‚Äôll be honest. I had reservations about a vaccine developed hastily in such a politically charged environment. But, by the time my place in line came up, enough people had taken it to assuage some of my own concerns. There may or may not be long term consequences from the vaccine‚Äî but we take vaccines every year without statistically significant problems. But the risk of covid are unpredictable long term health consequences or death, soon. Worse, in my case, almost certain death for my immune compromised husband. In the end, I was grateful for the opportunity to be vaccinated. But what‚Äôs playing out with Republicans is not about reason or normal reservations. It‚Äôs about hubris and frat-boy insolence, an embracing of ignorance as political tribalism. I don‚Äôt see how we survive as a country as long as one political party continues, at the top, to tip the scales to retain power, while simultaneously celebrating ignorance as a political cause among the voters. And I don‚Äôt see us as a country getting this pandemic under control. It‚Äôs a pathetic end game for our country.
0/0	I‚Äôll believe it when we have zero new cases or deaths
1/1	I‚Äôll get it as soon as its available. I‚Äôm ready!
1/1	I‚Äôll get it as soon as it‚Äôs available to me. Any kind of side effects from the vaccine will be better than getting COVID and giving it to my parents or grandparents.

0/0	I‚Äôll never get a Covid vaccine. Big pharma cares about profits over safety and their drugs and vaccines don‚Äôt generally make you sick in a day but instead over time.
0/0	I‚Äôll never take it!! I already had covid.it was nothing. I‚Äôve had colds that were worse.
0/0	I‚Äôll never take that toxic crap
1/1	I‚Äôll never understand people. They‚Äôre afraid to get a vaccine that has minimal links to blood clots. But they‚Äôll take birth control like it‚Äôs candy and they‚Äôd rather be exposed to covid - both of which are KNOWN to cause blood clots.

JNJ said no and won. So much for no safety signals.

1/1	I‚Äôm 100% sure if it‚Äôs the Pfizer‚Äôs covid vaccine specifically, it would just work fine. Thank you!
1/1	I‚Äôm 17 and I had my first shot a few days ago. Everything has been really ok, I think.
1/1	I‚Äôm 18 and I got moderna. My first shot was nothing more than a sore arm. But my second was a 103 degree fever (even after Advil) and was woken up with really painful muscle spasms up and down my back the night of. But the next morning I woke up (albeit super late) feeling fine. And the relief I‚Äôve felt since has definitely been worth it.
1/1	I‚Äôm 2 weeks out from my 2nd shot and I continue to mask and wash hands and socially distance. And while I keep doing the things that I have been, the sky is bluer, the heart is fuller, and my smile behind the mask is wider.
1/1	I‚Äôm 33 and have been lucky enough to grow up with all 4 grandparents in my life. November 31st one of my grandpas died of COVID. Last week the other 3 went to the same place together and got dose 1 of the vaccine. I wish he had of been here just a little longer.
0/0/0	I‚Äôm 36 years old and healthy. I have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid even if I get it. Lots of sources are saying that this current vaccine won‚Äôt protect me from all the variants and that at best maybe 3 months before I‚Äôd need another one. Why in the world would I ever take this vaccine? Nobody knows what the long term effects are going to be and I‚Äôm not going to be a test subject.
1/1	I‚Äôm 48 hours post-Moderna 2nd dose: no side effects, soreness in the muscle from the shot is mostly gone. Quit making excuses & #GetVaccinated ! #Science #EndCovid19 #StopTheSpread

0/0	I‚Äôm a 64 year old British woman two weeks later I‚Äôm very sick after the jab my goodness I‚Äôm not having another one
0	I‚Äôm a Canadian respiratory therapist and I declined my vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm a New Yorker who would show up for a vaccine day or night 24/7. I‚Äôm not alone. Knowing that capacity is going underutilized due to bureaucratic mismanagement is infuriating.
1/1	I‚Äôm a massive advocate for taking these vaccines, and even I don‚Äôt think it should be mandatory. They need to build trust in the vaccines in order to get people to take them, and forcing people to take them does the opposite. I fully trust them and will be proud to take them when able, but you can‚Äôt make people come together for the greater good by forcing something on them.
0/0	I‚Äôm a nurse and I am not getting the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm a nurse and got mine as soon as I could! My mother is 81 and has hers now too. We are both a month in to our second dose. I just was able to hug my mom for the first time in 13 months! It was wonderful!
1/1	I‚Äôm a nurse and received mine on Monday. No side effects but a sore arm. I honestly feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can‚Äôt wait to get the second dose and be done with it. Science is amazing
1/1/1	I‚Äôm a pro-vaxxer. Anyone want to have a debate about vaccines?
0/-1	I‚Äôm a proud ex vaxxer! I decided to look into what‚Äôs in the deadly destructive things...Wtf!!! Injecting anything is junkie play ...
1/1	I‚Äôm a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don‚Äôt spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm a registered nurse and I refuse to get it!
0/0	I‚Äôm a researcher in the medical field and a lot is being hidden from us regarding the safety of the vaccines. I‚Äôm sure Mike has already been vaccinated, glad he‚Äôs not carrying a baby!
1/0	I‚Äôm a scientist and I know how quickly integrity goes out the window when funding or even just a hot topic is at stake. There is immense political pressure to produce a vaccine, which can be accounted for in terms of personal risk.
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher and I got my first shot within 3 days of being eligible- my second one three weeks later. So many of my students and colleagues have lost family to COVID-19 - including me. Thank God you are in office amd science amd logic prevails!
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher in Iowa. We are supposed to be in the first tier of the next round, but nothing is happening. We are in person teaching and doing well, but want to be vaccinated so we are protecting ourselves and others.
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I can‚Äôt wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I will take the vaccine to protect myself and my family as soon as they allow me to take it. I want to be able to socialize with my family and my friends.
1/1	I‚Äôm a volunteer for the AstraZeneca trial in Washington state and I got my first injection yesterday.
1/1	I‚Äôm a young woman who had the vaccine due to my history of Cancer and an autoimmune disease. I felt really rough for 48 hours after, but I promise you, I would rather have had that than had Covid-19.
1/1	I‚Äôm absolutely fine .. just mild pain at injection site ! So far so good ! It appears safe ! Don‚Äôt worry about #safety & get a jab when your turn comes up !
0/0	I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months
1/1	I‚Äôm all for vaccination and I acknowledge their importance but it seems that they are willing to push forward the Astra Zeneca vaccine despite it‚Äôs obvious risks !!
1/1	I‚Äôm all for vaccines because I believe in science and the effectiveness of vaccines.
0/0	I‚Äôm allergic to testing positive for HIV I will not be taking the shot,
1/1	I‚Äôm also getting vaccine...it‚Äôs worth the race of mind. I had Covid in july
1/1	I‚Äôm am 59 yo and fully vaccinated as of yesterday
1/1	I‚Äôm angry about the vaccine distribution - canceling appointments and having insufficient doses for New York City makes absolutely no sense. People have been waiting for weeks. This is one of the original epicenters and the most densely populated city in the country.
0/0	I‚Äôm autoimmune, you can‚Äôt force me to take something that has an unknown chance of death
1/1	I‚Äôm blessed to have received my first dose last week. Thank you to all the researchers and scientists who made this possible. I truly believe it‚Äôs been a miracle!
1/1	I‚Äôm breastfeeding and got my vaccine which makes me so happy
0/0	I‚Äôm coming around to the idea that there isn‚Äôt actually anything in the vaccines, just placebos
1/1	I‚Äôm completely pro vaccine, but I have my reservations about a/z jab. I was quite open 3 weeks ago that as we get closer to when vaccines start to kick in efficacy wise, if they are not working as well as hoped we‚Äôll start finding resistant mutations.
0/1	I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm immune to Covid. The vaccine didn‚Äôt even give me one side effect.
1/0	I‚Äôm curious as to when in medical history there hasn‚Äôt been side effects. I need to see causation. This is speculative.
0/0	I‚Äôm definitely NOT going to be a lab rat and take this vaccine. You can‚Äôt force people
0/0	I‚Äôm definitely concerned about the long term ramifications on autoimmune disease, inflammation and human genome
1/0	I‚Äôm definitely not an anti-Vaccination type of person but they just came out with this vaccine who even knows if it‚Äôs safe.
1/1	I‚Äôm ecstatic to be among the third who has one shot. Second dose April 28! Let‚Äôs do this!
1/1	I‚Äôm excited we‚Äôre moving forward! Right now per the Bloomberg vaccine tracker were at ~2.4M doses a day with ~130M doses administered so far. At the current pace, we will hit the 200M mark around April 23, with April 30th being Biden‚Äôs 100th day. Though the doses are likely to increase daily, with the possibility of it actually decreasing at the end of April due to supply outweighing demand.
1/1	I‚Äôm extremely pro vaccine (and can‚Äôt wait for mine) but if you‚Äôre under 65 and not actively working a Covid ward we see you vax-bragging while our older relatives with extreme comorbidities still aren‚Äôt eligible or can‚Äôt locate a dose and I swear our judgement knows no limits.
1/1	I‚Äôm fine to get vaccines. Myself and my daughter have had all the normal vaccines
0/1	I‚Äôm fine to get vaccines. Myself and my daughter have had all the normal vaccines but I do not trust that this one won‚Äôt have been rushed through the process.
1/1/1	I‚Äôm for vaccinations, although I will never be among the first to get a vaccine. I will always wait for all the side effects of the vaccines to come out and do my research before I get a vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm from England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø.. also me and so many British people will not be having the vaccine don‚Äôt trust your government!!!!!
1/0	I‚Äôm from the USA and I‚Äôm embarrassed by the conduct of my government agencies with respect to the Astra Zeneca vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm from the uk and I‚Äôm so very sick 2 weeks after taking the vaccine please beware I have arthritis and it‚Äôs much worse it makes you feel like you‚Äôre dying
1/1	I‚Äôm fully vaccinated as of today. In two weeks once I reach full immunity, I‚Äôm moving on with my life. I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve held up the proverbial umbrella for a year. I have seen no one I love in months. I‚Äôm starting my life again. If people wanna wait for herd immunity, go for it. But the vaccine is my ticket and everyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs ticket out of this.
0/1/1	I‚Äôm genuinely envious of those who have the privilege to think covid is all some big hoax or isn‚Äôt a big deal and can brush off stuff like the vaccine. That tells me they were lucky enough to not see the direct consequences of it. Losing a loved one on a ventilator changes you.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting first shot on Monday and I‚Äôm so pumped!!
1/1	I‚Äôm getting it, I trust it. However, doctors and scientists are not helping themselves by saying ‚Äúyou still have to wear a mask for the long haul, even after both shots.‚Äù You want people to stop saying this is social engineering? Then stop the propaganda
1/1	I‚Äôm getting it, but I don‚Äôt want it forced on my fellows.

1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second Moderna shot tomorrow. After the first one I had chills and nausea for about 24 hours. My coworkers who got their second shot earlier this week ranged from arm soreness and general fatigue to full blown flu like symptoms for about 24 hours. I expect to feel the same but I‚Äôm ready for it! Update: got my second shot and I‚Äôm doing fine. No fever, no chills, nothing. Yah. About half my coworkers had no reaction, while the other half had fever, chills etc.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second and final dose tomorrow
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second dose next monday! I‚Äôm so excited!!! I haven‚Äôt had any colateral effects after the first dose
1/-1	I‚Äôm getting my second dose tomorrow! I might get a tattoo (my first and maybe only!) to commemorate the end of this shit show. Maybe a couple of bandaids overlapping in an ‚Äúx‚Äù where they stick me in the arm. Or my n95 hung up on a coat hanger. The relief I have felt since I got the first dose has already been immense. I have a girl that I care about deeply who I absolutely could not spread it to and my job is about as frontline as it gets so that was a constant risk I didn‚Äôt want to take with her, among everyone else in my life basically. But now for the same reason I was so risky, I get to be blessed with an early vaccine, and I can see the end of this on the horizon now.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second shot of Pfizer next week. I had extreme fatigue after the first one for 24 hours. Hopefully the second one isn‚Äôt as bad :( but better than getting Covid!

1/0	I‚Äôm going to kiss all of my friends straight on the mouth when I see them in person. I‚Äôve already gotten consent.
1/1	I‚Äôm going to take the vaccine for other people: pregnant women, younger kids, and the 7% of adults (immunocompromised) who won‚Äôt be able to take a vaccine early. If I don‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôm endangering them. They are counting on us or they are in real danger
1/1	I‚Äôm gonna get the vaccine because I‚Äôm not worried about it. But some people are. People worried about contracting it need to mask and get the vaccine
0/0	I‚Äôm gonna pray to god to heal me instead of getting the vaccine even tho i haven‚Äôt got corona yet.
0/1	I‚Äôm good!! Y‚Äôall have fun with that vaccine! I‚Äôll let the old folks get it and hospital clinical staff!!
0/1	I‚Äôm good!! Y‚Äôall have fun with that vaccine! I‚Äôll let the old folks get it and hospital clinical staff!! ‚úåÔ∏è
1/1	I‚Äôm grateful for the vaccine. I‚Äôve had both doses of Moderna. A little tired and a few chills after my 2nd. Beats the hell out of being on a ventilator in the hospital struggling to breathe
1/1	I‚Äôm happy to be vaccinated & to do my part to contribute to herd immunity in hopes of returning to a normal life. If you aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated, that‚Äôs your choice and your freedom. People who choose to receive the vaccine are allowed to be excited & to be hopeful. I know I am!
1/1	I‚Äôm hoping that once I am working for Duke come January I will have arrived in time to still get the vaccine. My current facility started administering it yesterday and I have to wait until January so I can get both doses from one location
1/1	I‚Äôm hoping to get into a trial. I think it‚Äôs crazy to stay at risk for covid any longer than necessary.
1/1	I‚Äôm in America and has signed up to receive the vaccine. I was worried at first because covid really affects people of color disproportionately. I am also a colon cancer survivor. Right now in my state they are only vaccinating seniors 65 years of age and older along with essential workers. To sign up I had to go online and register which required some basic personal information. I received and emailed confirmation for the registration and was told I would be notified when I am eligible for an appointment to receive it at the appointed time at a designated location. I thank your for sharing this very interesting and informative information. After hearing this professional discuss in detail every aspect of this effort I feel confident in receiving it. I do not know which vaccine I will get but I will still protect myself and others by wearing the mask, social distance and good personal hygiene. I understand the vaccine may not protect from variants.
0/0	I‚Äôm in UK and literally can‚Äôt understand why anyone in their right mind would want this vaccine. It‚Äôs had 5% of the normal testing time and you can‚Äôt sue if it goes wrong!!!! ??? !
1/0	I‚Äôm in my 50s and have a lung disorder. For me, I‚Äôm fairly certain the side effects of COVID would be way worse than the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm in the Jansson (J+J) vaccine trial which is an Adenovirus vector. Pretty sure I got placebo. :( I‚Äôd be psyched if that one gets approved and they offer the control arm it quickly. As far as vaccines in general I‚Äôm pretty sure it will go from unavailable to mandatory with no optional in between and I‚Äôm ok with that.
1/1	I‚Äôm in the US and on stage 3 of this trial. Very excited to hear this vaccine is moving forward!
1/1/0/1	I‚Äôm in the moderna clinical trial, so feel free to ask any Q about the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm interested in seeing what the average daily vaccination figure ends up being for Biden‚Äôs first 100 days. Think 2.5 million/day is feasible given the slower start? I think anything that gets us near 200 million people in the US vaccinated by April 30th would be a great start.
1/1	I‚Äôm interested in trying the vaccine
0	I‚Äôm just a kid who got it against my will, all these people are saying it‚Äôs bad‚Äî I don‚Äôt wanna die
0/-1	I‚Äôm just gonna say this one thing. This is just my opinion! The government makes you believe what they WANT you to believe.
1/1	I‚Äôm just recently passed the 2 week mark after my second dose.
1/1	I‚Äôm laughing at how people care more about the side effects then the positive affects, Like not dying!
1/1	I‚Äôm leaning toward moderna from the start I always had a good feeling about that one.
1/1	I‚Äôm like hello you‚Äôve had other vaccines based off the same thing but of course she won‚Äôt listen to reason.
1/-1	I‚Äôm liking all this good news.
1/1	I‚Äôm looking forward to get the vaccine!!!
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm low priority, which is as it should be, though I can‚Äôt wait to get that shot. Or shots.
1	I‚Äôm more afraid of government keeping covid powers, than dying from covid vaccine...
0/0	I‚Äôm more scared of the vaccine than covid itself. Covid has like a 99.5% survival rate or something like that so it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal unless your old and have health problems
0/0	I‚Äôm more than willing to lose my life than to be a hell candidate for the rest of my life! Jesus is my vaccine! I need no other
0/0	I‚Äôm neither elderly or immunocompromised, but I haven‚Äôt had kids yet. And until they‚Äôve tested this vaccine on pregnant women, researched it‚Äôs affect on fertility, and researched how it would impact children, I‚Äôm not touching it with a ten foot pole.
0/0	I‚Äôm never getting your gene editing serum
1/-1	I‚Äôm never sure who to believe when it comes to vaccines. The scientists who‚Äôve made it their lives work or the guy I went to school with that picked his nose & ate it and now abuses steroids
1/1/1	I‚Äôm no COVID denier, heck I got both of my COVID shots. I feel fine, it works!
0/0	I‚Äôm no lab rat and I‚Äôve already seen what it‚Äôs doing to so many lives. Killing them within days or weeks blaming underlined conditions yet, when people actually die of underlined conditions, they are calling most deaths COVID! No transparency at all
0/0	I‚Äôm not a believer in the flu shot, either. I just think that our body needs to fight off things naturally
0/0	I‚Äôm not a scientist but I listen to them ! The problem with using the genetic material is , how do u know it will release the correct virus code ? And the worry is autoimmune disease as a result ! It‚Äôs also unethical to use this type of technology on masses of people without a proper study ! Who knows what may happen to people vaccinated in 2/3 years time .
0/0	I‚Äôm not a test lab rat!. And nope, I don‚Äôt receive flu shots, never had the flu in my life.
0/0	I‚Äôm not afraid... I‚Äôm just not going to get a vaccine that gives me antibodies that I already have from having COVID.... I‚Äôm guessing by the time I need one it really won‚Äôt be that important though considering the amount of natural immunity plus vaccine immunity
0/0	I‚Äôm not an Anti Vaxxer but I ain‚Äôt taking the Covid Vaxx
0/0	I‚Äôm not an anti Vaxxer but I just want to know the long term side effects before I ever take a vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm not an anti vax trust me but I really hope this works
0/0	I‚Äôm not an anti vaxxer by no means but this vaccine was super rushed so I‚Äôm skeptical.

1/-1	I‚Äôm not anti vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm not anti vax but I‚Äôm going to wait a year to see if it has any negatives to then I‚Äôll probably get it
0/0	I‚Äôm not anti vax either, I just don‚Äôt wanna pump my body with expermental vaccines that haven‚Äôt got long term effects yet
0/-1	I‚Äôm not anti vaxx but I am not taking this one, I have an immune system thank you very much.
0/0/0/0/-1	I‚Äôm not anti-vaccination, but I find it highly concerning that this hasn‚Äôt even been around long and there is simply not enough time to adequately test long term effects. For me, this one is a hard pass. I need time to make an informed decision, not a rush to see who is first at my family‚Äôs expense.
0/0	I‚Äôm not being part of this experimental vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm not engaging with antivax folk . I have had vaccinations my whole life, so has my child . I have to trust the science as it has allowed so much good and prevented so much disease .

0/0	I‚Äôm not putting this toxic shit in my body even if I have to risk my life and rights I don‚Äôt care cause it‚Äôs my body my choice if I don‚Äôt want to
1/1	I‚Äôm not saying that vaccines are 100% safe. I‚Äôm just saying that its better to get a vaccine than to not get one
0/0	I‚Äôm not scared of COVID 19 because a lower percentage of ppl have had rlly bad effects on it
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure how long it‚Äôll take to get to young people like myself, but I‚Äôm looking forward to getting it and being able to live my life.
0/-1	I‚Äôm not sure how to feel anymore and that hurts
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure why you are so determined to find reasons why the vaccine does not work. There is clear evidence that it does work. The stuff you sent makes no point at all, because most of Israel is not yet vaccinated.
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure why, but YouTube comments are dumb as fuck. Go to the new comments section on a legit vaccine video. The word ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù and ‚Äúsheep‚Äù gets thrown around a lot and it really upsets me.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking a vaccine that a) Seems way too rushed and hasn‚Äôt had the side-effects properly studied and recorded and b) Will likely contain unnecessary shark squalene, leading to the death of around 500,000 already endangered sharks
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it , inject to the makers of that vaccine first
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it. Why because operation warp speed is entirely too fast. I am not willing to put me or my children through it knowing that my children and i have allergies. Not only that i just don‚Äôt really trust the medical industry for personal reasons.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking that crap vaccine......not going to force my kid to either.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine. Vaccines are literally Government Sponsored Eugenics programs to make people sick and reduce their cognitive abilities.

0/0	I‚Äôm not wearing a mask because that‚Äôs my decision I‚Äôm not taken the vaccine because that‚Äôs my decision and my body I do not trust the vaccine I do not trust the people who made the vaccine my body my choice
0/0	I‚Äôm not your guinea pig, maybe you are but I‚Äôm not.
0/0	I‚Äôm now an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12 months is giving me doubts.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm okay waiting. But as soon as it‚Äôs available I‚Äôll sign up immediately.
0/0	I‚Äôm on a fb page for Covid victims families and friends, it is a daily occurrence with people dying from the vaccine and they are all being swept under the carpet.
1/1	I‚Äôm on immune suppressant medication (Azathioprine) and had the Oxford Vaccine. I had a sore arm and the chills for 2 days but then I was fine. The jab is safe and it‚Äôs best to be protected.
0/0	I‚Äôm over 50, and it‚Äôs a firm No from me.
1/1	I‚Äôm past day 3 on moderna no side affects sore arm is getting better I will keep you updated
1/1	I‚Äôm perfectly fine, a tiny bit sore for about 5 minutes but that was it. So far anyway.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm praying that the vaccine will work and praying for a better 2021
0/0/0	I‚Äôm pregnant and definetly not getting it. I‚Äôm trying to put as little things possible in and on my body that is not thoroughly documented for safety. So it‚Äôs a no and I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to try and pressure me, although everyone else at work will likely ‚Äúhave to‚Äù take it (not literally of course but they‚Äôre are going to feel strong pressure from bosses and even colleagues I think). Also here in Sweden we are in general a bit careful with new vaccines after the panic mass-vaccination against the svineflu that occurred which led to an increased rate of narcolepsie in children and adolescents who got it. The state was for a long time paying out reimbursements for the affected ones... If I hadn‚Äôt been pregnant I would probably struggle a bit more with the decision though.
1/1	I‚Äôm pretty sure COVID has fucked my brain harder than any vaccine ever could so please get vaccinated
1/1	I‚Äôm pretty sure getting the vaccine is better/less risky than getting the virus
1/-1	I‚Äôm pro vaccine, but recently I‚Äôm slowly to appreciate people who doesn‚Äôt wanna get the vaccines. I mean, the world is overpopulated anyways so someone has gotta die.
1/1	I‚Äôm pro-vaccine because when people don‚Äôt vaccinate themselves and their children it increases the risks of them and others getting the disease.
1/-1	I‚Äôm proud of humans‚ù§Ô∏è as much as we messed up there r many good things in us‚ù§Ô∏è I love u all my human brothers and sisters
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm quitting my job if they require me to take it.
1/1	I‚Äôm really tired of these anti vaxer wingnuts. I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum, I didn‚Äôt catch it from a vaccine. There weren‚Äôt many 75 yrs ago. I inherited it from my father who was also on the spectrum & my son inherited it from me (just wish he had also inherited my math abilities)
1/-1	I‚Äôm really trying to become confident enough in this vaccine as to allow it for my family and myself.
1/-1	I‚Äôm really trying to become confident enough in this vaccine as to allow it for my family and myself. This was helpful
0/0	I‚Äôm refusing it, I don‚Äôt need it, I don‚Äôt trust this crooked government I‚Äôve broke every rule and have never felt better, let me live my life.
1/-1	I‚Äôm right in line after the Queen of England
1/1	I‚Äôm right there with you, Mayim! I haven‚Äôt taken the flu vaccine in years and I did not have my kids take it either. But last year I did. I, too, made my own vaccination schedule for both of my boys. I will be getting the COVID vaccine ASAP! And will be having my boys get it, too.
0/0	I‚Äôm scared of the vaccine because a lower percentage of ppl have had rlly bad effects on it
0/0	I‚Äôm scared they will force me to take the vaccine while I‚Äôm pregnant.. I just don‚Äôt feel that they know enough right now about the long term side effects of this yet. I will refuse it until more time has passed.
0/0	I‚Äôm scared to get injected because of these ‚Äúallergic reaction‚Äù allegations all over the media!
0/0/0	I‚Äôm sceptical about it due to how fast it‚Äôs been developed, I‚Äôm more worried about long term effects
1/1/1	I‚Äôm scheduled to go get vaccinated this afternoon and the site I‚Äôm going to gives the option between Moderna or J&J. I‚Äôm having anxiety over which to choose!
1/-1	I‚Äôm sending this to all the Anti-Vaxers in my circle
0/-1	I‚Äôm shocked about people saying they had terrible side effects but were happy! I‚Äôve had HaHb/YelF/Tetanus/ & other inoculations in the past NONE ever gave me trouble but the Covid vaccine I‚Äôm hearing a diff story...is it because it‚Äôs Gene therapy and not a traditional vaccine?
0/0	I‚Äôm sick of being gas lighted when we have been told for over a year to follow the science and now we are being asked to take a vaccine that hasn‚Äôt finished it‚Äôs studies.
1/1	I‚Äôm so glad I got my vaccine. I had symptoms after the second dose and it was a rough 12 hours, but I‚Äôd planned the day off. I had Gatorade and Tylenol at the ready, and 36 hours after the vaccine I felt perfectly normal. Later that day I took a 5 mile walk! I work at my hospital‚Äôs covid vaccine clinic, and a lot of people are back at work and feeling fine the day after their vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm so glad I got vaccination yesterday..
1/-1	I‚Äôm so glad this video exist now I can explain to my friends and family why it was so fast
1/1	I‚Äôm so happy I pushed myself this week with my workout and work! I got the 2nd covid-19 vaccine on Thursday and was so sick with every side-effect. I only missed one workout on Friday! So I count that as a win!!

1/1/-1	I‚Äôm so in!! Spouse is on mycophenolate and I‚Äôm on Hydroxychloroquine we‚Äôre both so suppressed I can‚Äôt even!
1/1	I‚Äôm so pleased I was vaccinated to stop the spread of deadly diseases and save lots of lives and didn‚Äôt listen to the lies spread today.
1/1	I‚Äôm so proud of my fellow healthcare workers. We cannot die doing this anymore.
1/1	I‚Äôm so proud of our @A2schools nurses for giving vaccine shots to special ed (self contained) classroom teachers today. Their calm & reassuring words helped everyone!
1/1	I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but please understand that it is still possible to contact COVID after the first vaccine. You have to get the second one for reliable immunity. Her death was from COVID, not the vaccine. It is impossible to contract Covid from the vaccine. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but please don‚Äôt put your own life at risk out of grief.
1/1	I‚Äôm so thankful that I am in the number of vaccinated.
1/1	I‚Äôm so very fortunate to be in a job/position that allowed for access to the COVID-19 vaccine. I am so thankful and after nearly a year of worry, RELIEVED
1/0	I‚Äôm sorry but are people being contrarian for the sake of it? Does anyone actually have a problem with mandatory vaccinations?
0	I‚Äôm still not gonna take it, I don‚Äôt trust a vaccine that has been made in 9 months, when its supposed to take 5-10 years to even make and get trusted
1/1	I‚Äôm surprised people are skeptical about the vaccine. I‚Äôm the only one at my work said I‚Äôll be down taking once it is available to us.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking it,
1/1	I‚Äôm taking mine in a few weeks, I know it will be a huge relief when they have both shots.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking my parents to get their first shots tmrw (Moderna) and can‚Äôt wait. Today, three managers (also seniors) I work with got their shots today.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking the vaccine since a lot of people do.
1/1	I‚Äôm thrilled to say that I got my first COVID vaccine dose today! College Station opened its vaccine hub today (which works great!) and I got the call as someone in phase 1b So proud to do my part to prevent the spread of COVID-19! #VaccinesWork
1/1	I‚Äôm tired of so many people saying they get sick from getting such and such vaccine so they don‚Äôt get it. Getting a little achy or sore means your immune system worked and you will likely be safer now.
0/0	I‚Äôm tired of them talking like everyone is gonna take it. I wanna hear about when I don‚Äôt take it.
1/1	I‚Äôm totally down to get a vaccine and go outside while they hide.
0/0	I‚Äôm trusting my immune system against the 99% virus.

1/1	I‚Äôm vaccinated!
1/1	I‚Äôm very compromised and will be high on the list for the vaccine in Canada. I‚Äôve been scared. I‚Äôm less so now.
1/1	I‚Äôm very glad you got it! I a CAT scan tech in the same boat. It‚Äôs been a very long year. I was supposed to have gotten my vaccine yesterday but Tuesday I tested positive for covid. Survived 10 months just to get it 5 days before my vaccine lol. Terrible luck. On the upside, I‚Äôm doing ok. I‚Äôm pretty sure I got it from work as my and my wife literally do nothing else so I hope everyone on the frontline can get it ASAP.
1/1	I‚Äôm very pro science, pro doctor (pro vaccine) etc. But we have to be willing to admit past failures.

1/1	I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit.
0/0	I‚Äôm with Craig on this and so is more than 50% of Australians. The vaccine is misinformation and dangerous , good luck being a GMO! Kill Gates openly admits it! seriously I am shocked how misinformed politicians are, either that or they‚Äôre just following orders?
0/0	I‚Äôm with themgood on them !! I‚Äôm not an anti vaxer but I will not be forced to have a ‚Äúso called‚Äù vaccine against my will..... it has not been tested enough ! Common sense !!
0/1	I‚Äôm worried about getting coronavirus whilst getting the vaccine
0/-1	I‚Äôm worried of a multi dose vaccine being drawn up correctly in the syringe. In particular if none medical staff are giving this injection. Accuracy is absolutely important. Too much could kill, not enough is no good.

1/-1	I‚Äôve been having this dream nightly that one day we wake up and COVID is gone. I go to bed hopeful each night. What a dream come true this would be.
0/0	I‚Äôve been hesitant to take any of them but recently thought about taking the J&J. I‚Äôm back to not taking any of them.
1/1	I‚Äôve been shielding and received my Covid jab, I currently have the chills, a headache , I‚Äôm tired but can‚Äôt sleep, I feel ill but it‚Äôs worth it. I know it‚Äôs my immune system working hard. To those who don‚Äôt want to get it, fine. But don‚Äôt spoil it for us.
0/0	I‚Äôve been telling a lot of people, friends, family and strangers, before this so-called vaccine came out, that It‚Äôs not safe! You need 3 to 5 years for study, at least! This was a rush job! Anytime you rush anything, it is bound to fail! You don‚Äôt rush anything that involves someone‚Äôs health or life! As far as seeing officials on television, and even hear about the president himself, receiving the vaccine, those shots could‚Äôve been just a placebo, and not the real deal! And even if it were, what they receive is totally different than what you receive! This COVID-19 virus was formulated to control the population! And this COVID vaccine (The Guyana tragedy Reverend Jim Jones Kool-Aid cocktail!) could just finish off what the COVID-19 virus could not, against the people who are not infected, and possibly naturally immune to some strains of the virus! And now, I am hearing that hospitals are intentionally putting non-Covid patients in the same room with infected Covid patients, in order to spread the pandemic, so they can put these patients on a ventilator, which will in turn provide a tidy sum of around $30,000 plus dollars from the federal government per person! One New York nurse exposed a hospital in New York by secretly filming inside the hospital showing the corruption that went on there! Here is the link‚Ä¶https://youtu.be/8VFngRmp1HE If they are doing it there in New York, you can bet your bottom dollar they‚Äôre doing it elsewhere in the United States Of America! Don‚Äôt take my word for it! Do your own research! Hospitals are a scary place to go nowadays! Even if you just go in for something as little as a sprained finger or a dog bite, there is a lot of risk visiting a hospital! You don‚Äôt know who has what! And it‚Äôs also scary to know, the doctors that you trust and depend on with your life, could betray you and set you up, in order to make a buck! Back in the old days, doctors use to care about their patients! Not anymore! All they care about, are Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs! They will prescribe medications for you that you don‚Äôt even need, or have a high risk of negative side effects, that is even more dangerous than your ailment! But don‚Äôt get me wrong! There are some good doctors out there, but It‚Äôs like finding a needle in a haystack, so to speak. No pun intended! :-)
1/1	I‚Äôve been to Mississippi a few times and it‚Äôs a unique, beautiful place. Delta Blues, catfish and hush puppies, cool wetter at least as compared to truly sweltering New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. Whether you‚Äôre white, black or red, my Mississippian brethren, please: get vaxxed. Doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs a supply/access problem but a demand/personal decision problem
1/1	I‚Äôve been vaccinated. One step closer to a normal life I hope
0/0	I‚Äôve done research and I‚Äôm choosing to pass. Respect that please.
1	I‚Äôve got mine! be sure you get yours!
1/1	I‚Äôve got my first Pfizer vaccine, I have a immune disorder, asthma and smoked for 20 years but quit 6 months ago. I had no difficulty at all on first vaccine. I‚Äôll be getting second in less than 3 weeks.
0/-1	I‚Äôve gotten a flu vaccine, A month ago and I feel like I‚Äôm going to regret it. I just learned how bad the flu vaccine was after I got it. I‚Äôm spiritual and have been aware of the toxic covid 19 vaccine. Honesty I don‚Äôt feel like my usual self. I am currently detoxing from it. Should I just let go of this fear? I really hope I have not messed up my DNA.
1/1	I‚Äôve gotten enough info to know that it‚Äôs fine. I will take my chance and get it.
0/0	I‚Äôve gotten enough info to know that it‚Äôs too risky and sus to take it this early
1/1	I‚Äôve had a dose of moderna yesterday and feel a little off, and my shoulder is pretty sore. But it‚Äôs all part of your immune system working. If you don‚Äôt get the vaccine, you‚Äôre just contributing to the problem and COVID will never die off.
1/1	I‚Äôve had a recent history with some bad lungs issues so I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve finally started this process. GET VACCINATED, FRIENDS! SAVE LIVES.
1/1	I‚Äôve had both of my doses. So grateful!
1/1/1	I‚Äôve had both, husband‚Äôs had one and we‚Äôre encouraged by this news for our children!
1/1/1/1/1	I‚Äôve had mine for 3 weeks now. Perfectly fine
1/1	I‚Äôve had mine in England and so have many of my friends. All who have been offered it have accepted
1/1	I‚Äôve had my #vaccination #VaccinationDrive Feeling fine. Tiny bit tired. Two hearts was super efficient and friendly. First day out of 2021
1/1	I‚Äôve had my first Moderna shot, looking forward to the second.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôve had people decline the Covid vaccine because someone they know felt unwell after theirs It‚Äôs ENTIRELY normal to get a temp, headache, sore arm or feel a bit run down after the vaccine: it‚Äôs your immune system responding well to it It‚Äôs SO MUCH better than getting Covid
0/0	I‚Äôve had pretty full on side effects over the last 24hours since having the Astra Zeneca Oxford vaccine which I‚Äôve reported via yellow card system in case they have been heighten by the medication I‚Äôm on (Zoladex, ibandronic acid, Letrozole)
0/0	I‚Äôve had terrible reaction to flu shot not sure I want to chance this vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve had the first injection of the vaccine about 2 weeks ago and I currently feel great
1/1	I‚Äôve had the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, as have many colleagues and friends of mine. I had a mildly sore arm. Others felt tired the day after, or mildly under the weather (such as with a cold). No one I have talked with or heard from has had any serious side effects.
1/1/1	I‚Äôve had the vaccine last week and I‚Äôm doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze
0/0	I‚Äôve heard a lot of negative things about the Covid vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve heard many people say they don‚Äôt want to be the 1st in line to take a new vaccine. They‚Äôd rather wait & see how it goes for other people. They ought to know that some of us have been vaccinated for a year already! My health has been monitored around the clock ‚Äì no issues.
0/0	I‚Äôve heard that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains aborted baby cells. Won‚Äôt be taking vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve just had my first Covid Vaccination. Flexed biceps, Like most, I was a little nervous beforehand. But I believe in the Scientists, I trust the NHS and it‚Äôs one step closer back to normality. Heart suit
1/1	I‚Äôve just realised that the only people I‚Äôve hugged since last March are my cats. Hopefully the #vaccination will mean I can have a #hug with other people I love
0/0	I‚Äôve made it this far without it so I‚Äôm taking my chances without it!
0/0	I‚Äôve never been afraid to get vaccinated or vaccinate my children. It‚Äôs the agenda behind the vaccine that makes people scared! I have never been pressured into the flu shot! It‚Äôs always been our choice. It should be the same with the Covid vaccine!! 99% Survial rate! I‚Äôll take my chances when it‚Äôs not even approved by the FDA!
1/1	I‚Äôve never been so happy in my life to have a bandaid on my arm. Vaccinated finally!
1/1	I‚Äôve never been so happy to get a vaccine
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôve never been this excited to get stabbed in my life
1/1	I‚Äôve never bothered with the flu vaccine, I am 71, but decided to have the Covid vaccine as I am desperate to have camping holidays this year when last year many campsites remained closed all year. The Powys vaccine centre I attended today was very well organised.
1/-1	I‚Äôve never had a flu jab before as I never get sick but I think this is the right thing to do for the benefit of everyone. I‚Äôll not be the first to take vaccine but I will take it.
1/1	I‚Äôve never had any struggle with vaccines, been taking them and literally no side effects!
0/-1	I‚Äôve never trusted doctors and I never will. They‚Äôre mindless drones that get filled with bullshit in med school
0/-1	I‚Äôve read that getting the vaccine is contraindicated if you have an allergy to propylene glycol
1/1	I‚Äôve received my first dose on the 27th of March and get my second on the 24th of April and my husband is set to get his first dose on the 7th. It would be awesome if our children were also able to receive a vaccine, our oldest is the only one who would qualify with the age restriction of 12. ü§ûüèΩ
0/0	I‚Äôve seen articles were they are claiming that people who got the shot and died are dying of ‚ÄúThe New Variant‚Äù
1	I‚Äôve seen some comments that say your chances of an adverse reaction from the vaccine are higher than the risk of death from the virus, so they‚Äôre willing to take their chances and not get vaccinated. It‚Äôs maddening.
0/0	I‚Äôve spent the last 5 years fighting to reverse years of damage by over a decade of pharmaceutical use; I will NOT take this jab willingly. I can‚Äôt understand why a 95% survival rate justifies the risk. God help us all!
1/1	I‚Äôve taken the vaccine and I‚Äôm completely fine. All I felt was muscle pain on my arm for a day or two.
0/0	I‚Äùm rolling my sleeve up as we speak...NOT!
0/0	J & J couldn't get baby powder right, why would anybody believe they could get the vaccine right. baby powder caused ovarian cancer in some women. For years J & J kept it a secret until it was found out.
0/0	J and J and Astra Zeneca are being paused because they don't have the mnra to later kill people.
0/0/1	J&J couldn't even get baby powder right, so now they want to inject a poison into your body....don't think so.
1/1	J&J is incredibly safe and effective.
1/1	J&J is just one shot so you probably got Pfizer or Moderna, congrats on getting vaccinated! I‚Äôm looking forward to mine.

0/0	Jesus also warned to not take the vacinne, because it makes you weaker
0/0	Jesus didn‚Äôt believe in leprosy...or death for that matter. So I doubt he would take a product that has not been licensed, has no liability, caused death in animal trials,used aborted babies to develop, manufactured by companies who pay billions in lawsuits for lying about safety

1/1	Johnson & Johnson submits for emergency use authorization from FDA. This is a huge gamechanger to have a single-dose vaccine with easy storage that appears based on preliminary results to prevent severe disease‚Äî& critically, hospitalizations & deaths
0/0	Johnson and Johnson are bringing out a vaccine now? Didn't they get took to court about talcum powder causing ovarian cancer?
0/0	Johnson and Johnson was just paused by the CDC and FDA.... Probably best to not push it right now. Remember the baby powder with asbestos that they sold?
0/0	Johnson's words today are part of the global 'Build Back Better' Cabal with Justin Trudeau saying lockdowns are needed as vaccines are not enough. The hoax has been revealed - they all copy each other
0/0/0	Join The NO MOVEMENT, A GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENT.............NO TO VACCINE PASSPORTS....NO TO FAUCHISM...NO TO WOKE CANCEL CULTURE......Boycott Corporations, Businesses That Support Reducing You To A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN!!! Tell Politicians NO WAY!! Vote Them Out!!!! #NOMOVEMENT .........Time to Crank Up The Buzz Saw of Freedom
1/1	Joined the Moderna gang today. Arm still sore 12 hours later, I expect it to continue into tomorrow. No illness so far though, which is nice. I wonder if the nanobots have begun their installation of Windows into my brain yet? Can't wait for the second dose in a month for my Office install.
1/1	Joking aside, this is freaking impressive!!!!! I think I'll take it.
0/0	Jonas Salk the doctor who created the polio vaccine was a supporter of eugenics! He said vaccines could be used to create cancers and test on humans mrna. Don't believe me??? Go read his book THE SURVIVAL OF THE WISEST! We have been conditioned to believe vaccines are good when in all actuality we are being tested on like guinea pigs. Go read the book and will be more than happy to give citations upon your request.

0/-1	Just Say No...Sorry not Happening.
1/1	Just a friendly reminder, the vaccine can't make you sick. The mRNA vaccines, which doesn‚Äôt contain the virus (Pfizer & Moderna) causes your body to mount a significant immune response to create antibodies. The symptoms you experience afterwards, such as headache, fever, soreness, and fatigue, are side effects from your immune system kicking into gear. ùêíùê®ùê¶ùêû ùê©ùêûùê®ùê©ùê•ùêû ùê°ùêöùêØùêû ùê´ùêûùê©ùê®ùê´ùê≠ùêûùêù ùê¨ùê≠ùê´ùê®ùêßùê†ùêûùê´ ùê¨ùê¢ùêùùêû ùêûùêüùêüùêûùêúùê≠ùê¨ ùêöùêüùê≠ùêûùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¢ùê´ ùê¨ùêûùêúùê®ùêßùêù ùêùùê®ùê¨ùêûùê¨ ùê∞ùê¢ùê≠ùê° ùêßùê® ùê©ùê´ùêûùêØùê¢ùê®ùêÆùê¨ ùêûùê±ùê©ùê®ùê¨ùêÆùê´ùêû ùê≠ùê® ùêúùê®ùêØùê¢ùêù. ùêÉùê®ùêß'ùê≠ ùêüùê´ùêûùêöùê§ ùê®ùêÆùê≠ ùê¢ùêü ùê≤ùê®ùêÆ ùê†ùêûùê≠ ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¨ùêû ùê¨ùê¢ùêùùêû ùêûùêüùêüùêûùêúùê≠ùê¨ ùêüùê´ùê®ùê¶ ùêö ùêÇùê®ùêØùê¢ùêù-ùüèùüó ùêØùêöùêúùêúùê¢ùêßùêû. ùêìùê°ùêûùê≤ ùêúùêöùêß ùêöùêúùê≠ùêÆùêöùê•ùê•ùê≤ ùêõùêû ùêö ùê†ùê®ùê®ùêù ùê¨ùê¢ùê†ùêß.

1/-1	Just a heads up - I (33F) got my 2nd Moderna shot earlier this week and it knocked me out for a good 36 hours - had fever, bodyaches, etc. Arm was sore for about 48 hours. Still worth it!
1/-1	Just a little tip for people who are scared of needles. Give a good hearty cough as the needle pierces the skin and you won't feel a thing. This really works, so ask the nurse to tell you 'when'.
0/0	Just a reminder of what the corporate media is not reporting. This is a very moving testimony on dangers of this experimental not fully licensed covid vaccine...
0	Just a reminder of who owns the patent to this virus and its supposed cure. No liability for permanent harm, death, infertility or long term effects. No test. They say you need it every 6 months and still need to wear a mask......tell me another lie.
1/1	Just a reminder that 554,000 American souls have died from #COVID19 #Vaccinate #WearAMask
1/1	Just a sore arm for a few days like you get from any vaccination. Much better than getting Covid!
0/0	Just a splash of aborted fetal cells, animal cells, DNA altering rmna, aluminum (known to cause Alzheimer‚Äôs), mercury, formaldehyde, and many other nefarious ingredients that if I spoon fed them to my child I would be in jail. But it‚Äôs ok to pump this straight into they system bypassing the immune system?
1/0	Just about a year from this video's publication and this vaccine was administered to me. Modern science is incredible. Stay in school kids.
1/1	Just actually got my shot a couple hours ago of typing this I feel a little sore in my shoulder but everything is fine. Go Science!
0/-1	Just another way to control and manipulate humans.
0/0	Just ask Hank Aaron about the vaccine ‚ÄúOh you can‚Äôt‚Äù he died just 14 day‚Äôs later
0/0	Just avoid getting any of the vaccines. You‚Äôre going to have to get it every year anyhow. Just have your immune system handle it instead of being poisoned by what‚Äôs in that crap. Stop being guinea pigs.
1	Just bc it fast doesn't mean it's unsafe
0/0	Just because some people are stupid enough to fall for this doesn't mean everybody is!!!
1/1	Just because someone dies after they had a vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean the vaccine caused it. I‚Äôve had mine and will die some day but it won‚Äôt have caused my death.
0/0	Just because someone doesn‚Äôt want to take an experimental vaccine that has no long term trials and no avenue for compensation if something were to go wrong doesn‚Äôt mean they are anti science and against all medicine, everyone just wants to shove people into little boxes, no more individuals with individual choices. Should I be able to decide what car you can buy or what foods you can eat? What a bunch of mini dictators people are turning into. You should leave that man alone if he doesn‚Äôt want the vaccine, aren‚Äôt you safe from him anyway being a vaccinated, double masking, social distancing sociopath?
0/0	Just because the celebrities are doing it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to do it too
1/1	Just because ur child doesn't react well to a vaccine, doesn't mean u should be forcing other people not to get one
1/1	Just because you don‚Äôt understand something doesn‚Äôt mean its okay to bash it like you are. These vaccines will be responsible for saving hundreds of thousands of lives, so I think that people can handle being sick for a day or two to make that happen.
1/1/1/1/1	Just because you have an adverse reaction to vaccines doesn‚Äôt mean nobody should get vaccines
0/0	Just because you havnt grown a 2nd nose yet, doesn't mean that you are in the clear. It still changes your DNA.

1/1	Just got back from getting my second dose! So happy, looking forward to hugging my grandkids!
1/1/1	Just got home from filming and was blessed to be able to recieve my first #vaccine shot!
1/1	Just got it today!Ok, so as a healthcare worker, I will admit that I feel something of an obligation to get the shot, if only to help protect the patients I interact with every day. But, beyond that, as a pharmacist who has read the EUA‚Äôs (emergency use authorizations) for both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines, I can tell you I have a lot of confidence in both of these vaccines. Confidence that they are safe, and confidence that they work really well to prevent me from getting (and transmitting) COVID-19.
1/1	Just got it today, I‚Äôm just happy to finally be able to get past this virus at long last
1/-1	Just got mine I? still feeling good just sore like a flu shot

1/1	Just got my first COVID vaccine and it makes me so happy to know that soon I‚Äôll be able to hug my nana again
1/1	Just got my first Moderna dose! I had mild side affects the first two days, then I felt completely normal. Totally worth it so that we can reduce the spread and hopefully get closer to normal this year!
1/1	Just got my first corona vaccine. Things are looking up!
1	Just got my first dose of the Covid vaccine today. Remember to get the vaccine to help our healthcare workers that have sacrificed so much for all of us over the past year. And take time to thank a healthcare worker today. It takes a very special person to do what they do.
1/1	Just got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today, woohoo!
1/1	Just got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today. Everything went fine. Just some slight burning and a slight cold feeling in my arm during the vaccination. My arm is getting more sore as the day goes on.
1/1	Just got my first dose of the vaccine! So excited.
1/1	Just got my first dose today!
1/1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Already set for shot number 2 on April 27th
1/1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Honestly for side effects all I've had is some arm pain but that should be anticipated with any vaccine. I would encourage people to take it as I got it and I'm perfectly alright. As the video explained ( if you watched it ) that the vaccine makes your body produce the spike protein so if you ever do catch Coronavirus your body should fight it off. I'm going to get my second dose on 2/11/21. What I think is messed up is people fearing the one thing that could end the pandemic than the virus itself.
1/1	Just got my first dose! My arm isn? even sore!
1/1	Just got my first dose, stay safe everyone!
1/1	Just got my first dose. Nothing to complain about but maybe some injection site pain but you'd get that with any of them. Stay safe everyone, vaccinated or not.

1/1	Just got my first shot (moderna shot) side effects were pretty mild.
1/1	Just got my first today. Never dreamt I‚Äôd get it this soon.

1/1	Just got scheduled for my first dose on Saturday. Very excited!
1/1	Just got shot #2 yesterday. I‚Äôm doing my part. Are you?
1/1/1	Just got some of those sweet, sweet mRNA juices in my left arm. FACT*: If you get a two-shot vaccine and plan for one in each arm, you end up with two COVID-punching arms. If you get both shots in one arm, then that arm can hit COVID twice as hard.
1/1	Just got the J&J shot yesterday. The side effects are real but a good thing. It means my immune system is working
1/1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson and everyone is telling me I should?e waited for another. But I know it doesn? matter

1/1	Just got vaccinated yesterday ‚≠êÔ∏è‚úä I can say, it‚Äôs legit. I‚Äôm having some of the same mild symptoms (chills, headache) I had when I had covid 8 months ago, so that means my body is working on making those antibodies again.

1/1	Just let me take this vaccine soon! I just wanna be safe!
1/1	Just let the anti vaxxers die off.
0/0/0/0	Just like the FBI/CIA did with the word ‚Äúconspiracist‚Äù they‚Äôre doing the same with with the word ‚Äúanti-Vaxxer‚Äù The fact that all these people are being silenced; it should speak volumes about what‚Äôs going on
0/0	Just like the flu, there will be a new "strain" every year and they'll shoot in the dark and blame citizens for not getting vaccinated enough. Bait and switch.
0/0/0	Just like the virus itself, the vaccine can effect everyone differently. Take that with what you will.
1/-1	Just like those that think covid is a hoax are the first ones to get the vaccine
1/-1	Just look back in history in 1952 at polio a record year for polio 57,628 people got polio there is no proof vaccines make people sick or kill people. And for the vaccines cause autism is total crap as person who is on the autism spectrum and can we all remember the doctor who said vaccines caused autism it was found out that the doctor lied on his medical papers about his findings on autism was caused by vaccines let's ask people all the familys of the people who died from polio or people who got polio lived if the polio vaccine is a lie
1/1	Just looking at the number of cases it does appear to be effective at preventing the spread. Hopefully the vaccine cut 10 months off the pandemic and there are no long term consequences or unforeseen side effects down the road.
1/1	Just mail me my vaccine, like voting. I don't want to stand in line. I'll take it myself.
1/1	Just make it mandatory.
0/-1	Just met my next door neighbour who has had the Corona jab and the flu jab and she said both her and her husband have had a chesty cold since before Christmas. This happens to them every year after the flu jab. Talk about doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome. Some years they have been really bad and why they do it is beyond me. Pumping yourself full of man made vaccines can not do your natural immune system any good in fact it could ultimately destroy it.
0/1	Just note how remarkable has been the development process for vaccines. This normally takes years or many many months: we now have 3 tested vaccine candidates at advanced trials stage
0/0	Just passing this on I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me: First of all, up until this point there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. [1] In preliminary animal trials for previous coronavirus vaccines (SARS and MERS), animals were vaccinated and seemed to exhibit a robust antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe organ inflammation (especially in lungs), and they died. [2][3] Paradoxical immune response in coronavirus vaccines has also taken place in human trials, which occurred during testing of the failed RSV vaccines of the 1950s. [4] Alarmingly, there are some statistical indications of ADE in covid vaccine trials, but there is no way to know for sure because many key signifiers of ADE weren‚Äôt specifically addressed. [5] Due to emergency protocol, the usual method of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed, limited animal testing occurred in parallel with humans, and the potential for ADE was not comprehensively assessed. [6] [7] Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years from now when vaccinated persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or genetically similar versions of coronavirus. [8] Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are ‚ÄúPEGylated‚Äù, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol).[9] PEGs can lead to life threatening anaphylaxis or other conditions such as thrombocytopenia. [10] [50] Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. [11] Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune disorders. [12] These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs [13][14][15], yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. [16] Also, there is some worrying evidence to suggest that PEGs cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, possibly causing inflammation and/or autoimmune conditions, a fact gleaned from previous animal studies on mRNA vaccines. PEGs were found to be distributed across a spectrum of tissues including the brain. [52] Additionally, nanoparticles (such as PEGylated hydrogel) are known components for state of the art medical interventions, including biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa Inc. [17][18][19][20][21] The secretive nature of this technology necessitates a knowledge gap between developers and the general public, so although my research efforts have yet to verify a direct functional relationship between PEGylated nanoparticles used in covid vaccines and biosurveillance, I personally do not relish the prospect of being injected with such given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex. Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. [22] Vaccines should be tested for multiple years to adequately assess their longterm effects. [23] Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves. [24] Fourth, the efficacy number of 90% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna is statistically misleading, reporting a relative reduction instead of absolute reduction of risk*. Also, the trials only assessed these vaccines‚Äô ability to prevent mild symptoms and NOT their ability to prevent transmission. [25] If they don‚Äôt prevent people from transmitting the virus (especially when safer, cheaper drugs like Ivermectin do) [26] [27] what‚Äôs the point? Fifth, these are NOT vaccines in the normal sense. They are mRNA vaccines, which utilize a completely different process for achieving disease protection**; mRNA vaccines seek to introduce messenger RNA into the body in order to ‚Äútrick‚Äù cells into producing immunogens, which then stimulate an immune response. [28] These vaccines are the first of their kind ever to gain authorization. [29] Current vaccinations are essentially an extension of phase 3 of the trials. [30] Because of the lack of long term safety assessment and the new nature of this technology, people are participating in a mass human experiment with no way of knowing the long term health effects these could cause. Many problems from vaccines are known to have an incubatory period and do not manifest until much later, which is why testing needs to occur for multiple years in order to adequately assess risk. [31] One such problem currently being discussed is the mRNA technology‚Äôs possible impact on female fertility, as it encourages the production of antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that contains a very similar protein crucial for the development of placenta called syncytin-1. This could interfere with the reproductive process by encouraging the immune system to react against syncytin-1, thereby disrupting placental development. [32] The vaccines‚Äô impact on fertility is currently unknown as animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. [33] Sixth, there was a signature for many different problems seen in the various trials and initial rollout for these vaccines, problems that are concurrent with commonly documented vaccine injuries. Injuries that did occur in the various trials/rollout have included, but are not limited to, anaphylaxis, Bell‚Äôs palsy, transverse myelitis, multi-system inflammatory syndrome, encephalomyelitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and death. [34] [35] [36] [37] [50] [51] Seventh, and perhaps most importantly, the movement toward potential vaccine mandates or other coercive policies violates humanity‚Äôs most universally accepted principles of human rights and medical ethics, especially for a medical intervention with so many known and unknown safety/efficacy concerns. The absolute bedrock of medical ethics is the right to informed consent, as individuals must be made fully aware of all the potential benefits and risks associated with a medical intervention, while still maintaining the right to decline that intervention should they so choose. [41] Mandates or coercive measures fundamentally violate historical safeguards humanity has put in place to protect us from the ever present threat of medical tyranny, including the Nuremberg Code, the United Nations‚Äô International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and UNESCO‚Äôs Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. [42] [43] [49] Such would also be in violation of the Hippocratic Oath, for not only do oath keepers pledge first to do no harm, but also to treat the needs of the patient. [44] This implies that a doctor‚Äôs duty primarily pertains to the needs of the individual before the needs of the collective, a vital distinction made by Hippocrates and understood for nearly 2 millennia. [45] [46] Privileging the needs of the collective is a ‚Äúfallacy of misplaced concreteness‚Äù. [47] While individual need is directly apprehensible and consensual, collective need is an abstract, subjective concept not easily defined. And yet who usually gets to define this concept? Such is most often defined by those in power with the most means to influence institutional narratives, turning medical professionals who treat the needs of the collective according to this definition into mere extensions of that power at the expense of individual informed consent.
0/0	Just proves that the vaccinations...are pointless.
0/0	Just pushing vaccines with more BS. Do you think the lock down of our ability to live life has anything to do with the traumas?
1/1	Just read on Wikipedia, vaccines have saved millions of lives and untold suffering. Read about polio.
1/1	Just received mine today, I feel totally fine so far. Administration was uneventful! We have to report how we are feeling every day for three weeks and then keep reporting monthly up to a year.

1/1	Just scheduled my 17 year old daughter's vaccine appt. Just need Pfizer to be approved for 12 to 15 year olds. Then I will be able to breath.
0/0	Just so everyone knows. All drugs and vaccines undergo large trials (tens of thousands of people) to make sure they are safe and effective - Phase 3 trials. That said. We never know EVERYTHING that could happen because it‚Äôs only a few months of safety data - in this case about 2 months of data. Most side effects you will see occur in that time. NOT ALL. So yes there is some uncertainty. Of course there is. You‚Äôll probably feel like shit for a few days, headache and muscle ache. But that means that mRNA got into your system good and you‚Äôre making antibodies to the spike protein like this video talks about. You eliminate the protein and the mRNA but your antibodies should remain. I won‚Äôt be the very first to get it but I won‚Äôt wait too long. The longer we wait the worse this gets. COVID won‚Äôt just blow over at the rate things are going. No way. And I don‚Äôt admit that this vaccine is the end all be all either. But it‚Äôs something.

0/0	Let me just recap this more simply - mRNA will transcribe onto your cells part of the genoma related to a protein unique to Covid-19. It will "instruct" your cells into producing it and that - in theory, but sadly there's not data on long term effects of this doing - should trigger the production of antibodies to fight it. Pity that because your own immune system will be creating that protein which your antibodies will then have to fight, it will be as if you had acquired an auto-immune disease. Your cells are not designed to produce any "foreign" protein, especially that of viruses. You can have it, and good luck with it!

1/-1	Let there be Covid Crisis committee formed at all district/state/center level for close monitoring & cohesive coordination for making available the essentials to combat covid-19. Vaccination can take a back seat or go on but patients need urgent medical treatment or will die.

0/1	Let's ask Bill Gates if it's safe? Then let him have all of them all at once!
1/1	Let's be honest: It is a good thing that the EU manages and buys the vaccines. If it doesnt richer/bigger countries would have outbid the smaller ones leaving them behind without any vaccines.
1/1	Let's be positive! The late spring and summer will see the amount of virus reduce significantly. If by then we can also make sure that the vulnerable have received their jabs, we will all be in a much stronger situation! In the meantime we have to hope and pray that we keep as many people safe as possible.

If people don't get it now, they never will.

0/0	Let's say it like it is, forced vaccines = rape.
1/0	Let's see just how much we can get away with"
1/0	Let's see... we were told it is 99% effective, HOWEVER, once vaccinated, you still need to wear masks because you can still get the virus. How does "99% effective" and "...you can STILL get the virus even if vaccinated..." square up? Which is it? Then, there's the question concerning those who have had the virus and survived, like 99.8% of those that get the virus. What is the benefit of getting a vaccination to protect you from a virus you've already recovered from? Would you get a flu vaccination AFTER recovering from the flu? Considering that Covid is a Coronavirus, like the Common Cold, Influenza, SARS, and MERS, that constantly mutates and that no vaccine has ever been successfully created to combat, is it possible that therapeutics like Ivermectin and others are a more viable method of combatting Covid? There's recently been a report of a Covid treatment that works like TamiFlu and is available by prescription. Why be part of an experiment when treatments exist that don't require one to be experimented on? Maybe people's resistance to the Covid vaccine stems from Common Sense and the underlying feeling that something's not quite right about all of this.

0/0	Let‚Äôs make sure we are clear‚Ä¶ This is not a vaccine. They are using the term ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù to sneak this thing under public health exemptions. This is not a vaccine. This is mRNA packaged in a fat envelope that is delivered to a cell. It is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen creator. It is not a vaccine. Vaccines actually are a legally defined term under public health law; they are a legally defined term under CDC and FDA standards.[1] And the vaccine specifically has to stimulate both the immunity within the person receiving it and it also has to disrupt transmission. And that is not what this is. They (Moderna and Pfizer) have been abundantly clear in saying that the mRNA strand that is going into the cell is not to stop the transmission, it is a treatment. But if it was discussed as a treatment, it would not get the sympathetic ear of public health authorities because then people would say, ‚ÄúWhat other treatments are there? The use of the term vaccine is unconscionable for both the legal definition and also it is actually the sucker punch to open and free discourse‚Ä¶ Moderna was started as a chemotherapy company for cancer, not a vaccine manufacturer for SARSCOV2. If we said we are going to give people prophylactic chemotherapy for the cancer they don‚Äôt yet have, we‚Äôd be laughed out of the room because it‚Äôs a stupid idea. That‚Äôs exactly what this is. This is a mechanical device in the form of a very small package of technology that is being inserted into the human system to activate the cell to become a pathogen manufacturing site. And I refuse to stipulate in any conversations that this is in fact a vaccine issue. The only reason why the term is being used is to abuse the 1905 Jacobson case that has been misrepresented since it was written. And if we were honest with this, we would actually call it what it is: it is a chemical pathogen device that is actually meant to unleash a chemical pathogen production action within a cell. It is a medical device, not a drug because it meets the CDRH definition of a device. It is not a living system, it is not a biologic system, it is a physical technology - it happens to just come in the size of a molecular package. So, we need to be really clear on making sure we don‚Äôt fall for their game. Because their game is if we talk about it as a vaccine then we are going to get into a vaccine conversation but this is not, by their own admission, a vaccine. As a result it must be clear to everyone listening that we will not fall for this failed definition just like we will not fall for their industrial chemical definition of health. Both of them are functionally flawed and are an implicit violation of the legal construct that is being exploited. I get frustrated when I hear activists and lawyers say, ‚Äúwe are going to fight the vaccine‚Äù. If you stipulate it‚Äôs a vaccine you‚Äôve already lost the battle. It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It is made to make you sick. 80% of the people exposed to SARSCOV2 are asymptomatic carriers. 80% of people who get this injected into them experience a clinical adverse event. You are getting injected with a chemical substance to induce illness, not to induce an immuno-transmissive response. In other words, nothing about this is going to stop you from transmitting anything. This is about getting you sick and having your own cells be the thing that get you sick. When the paymaster for the distribution of information happens to be the industry that‚Äôs doing the distributing, we lose. Because the only narrative is the one that will be compensated by the people writing the check. That goes for our politicians‚Ä¶ and our media - it has been paid for - if you follow the money you realize there is no non-conflicted voice on any network." - Dr. David Martin, Jan 5th 2021.
1/1/1	Let‚Äôs not blow this out of proportion, the vaccine was administered to about 7 million people and only 6 people had blood clots and only 1 died so if all of Norway got the J&J vaccine only one would die if any based on those numbers

I want to travel overseas, go on a cruise, have a night on the town, visit people in another state and heaps of other things. Quite frankly, without these things then I am just existing, not living. If the experts believe that a vaccine is part of the way back, I'm for it. As for animal testing, probably can't complain as I tuck in to a juicy steak!

1	Luckily I had my Second shot
1/1	Luckily the Covid vaccine is not like others because the researchers did not have to struggle for years trying to get funded. Also, unlike most trials there was no shortage of volunteers to test it on. Also, researchers had started working a similar vaccine years before so much of the preliminary work was already done. Also, because of ridiculously lavish funding, they did not have to write up proposals and get approval every few months to keep research running. They were able to work fast not because of cutting corners of lack of testing but because they actually had the money they needed and prior work had already been done.

0/0	Make their own vaccine propaganda videos, you think they won't pay people to convince the intelligent citizens that figured out the charade early on that there's nothing to worry about, and to literally sit back and do nothing? And then congratulate them for inaction! If you üëá

0/0	Makes one so mad. Drs just don‚Äôt give a fly. They know the risks but keep bleeding the rewards are better than the risks. I think not. It‚Äôs maddening
0/0	Makes people sterile! Agenda 2021
1/1	Makes sense xx get the vaccine.... GET THE VACCINE... lets do this ... Vaccinate ..be safe ..continue to wear masks so as to be sure we cannot still pass the disease post vaccine... Simples fam. Lets do this
1/1	Making fun of anti vaxxers is like a non vaccinated child, it never gets old.
1/1/1	Mam each and every drug have it's own demerits. I think that u might have been known. Most of the antibiotics now used is nephrotoxic effect. Please don't spread this type of tweet during the pandemic period. Kindly u delete this or to encourage vaccination.
1/1	Mam‚Äôs had her #vaccination today. ‚ÄúEasy peasy‚Äù was the feedback. A very happy Pamela tonight. Thanks #NHS
1/0	Man I didn't know they essentially speed ran making the vaccines! I'm due to get vaccinated soon since I caught covid early this year so it's kinda cool learning how this stuff is made - I mean it's gonna be put inside of me I kinda want to know how it does it's business at least
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Man playing god again, you probably shouldn't take vaccine.
1/1	Man, my friends and I cant wait to all get together for a post vaccination party.
0/0	Man-made Vaccine to "cure" a man-made Disease. I know Genocide when I smell it, and this smells like Genocide . DISLIKE
0/1	Managing a vaccine at -70¬∞C is too massive a challenge not just for India, but, for any country with a tropical climate. Europe & North America can have the Pfizer vaccine, the rest of the world needs the likes of Oxford, COVAXIN, SPUTNIK-V..etc.(cost effective and easy to store)
1/1	Mandatory vaccination. That is all
0/0	Mandatory vaccines are not on my agenda! I affirm my right to say NO
0/0	Many People Tests Positive After Getting COVID Vaccine Shots Throughout The Country! Vaccine Shots Are Bogus!
1/1	Many choose not to vaccinate their children for fear of giving their child autism, many forget that the alternative can be much worse.
1/1	Many conspiracy theorists have been touting that the mRNA vaccines fundamentally change our genome, yet they fail to realize single strand RNA won‚Äôt fit into a double strand human DNA sequence
0/0	Many country in Europe have stop takling AstraZeneka. Peopel here in Norway as also dead after taking this vaccine.
1/1	Many health agencies across the globe have found the vaccine to be safe. The benefits of the vaccine are not only preventing infection for yourself (thus preventing your own death and long term health effects from covid), but also should include slowing the spread of covid and preventing you from transmitting it others.
1/1	Many of My family members in the UK have had the Astra Zeneca and they are all fine.
0/0	Many of the covid-19 vaccines actually have been vaccines developed over the last decade and could not pass safety procedures, but are now being forced on citizens under EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, meaning you will be used as the experimental guinea pig. Not mentioned by mainstream media is that coronavirus covid-19 can be cured overnight by any or a combination of the following: Supersalts 1 drop in 1 glass water Aphrodisia 1 tsp in 1 glass water Virgin coconut oil 1 tbsp 3x daily 2,000 mg fish oil 3-5x daily Vitamin C 2,000 mg 5-10x daily Zinc supplement Vitamin D or 15 minutes of sunshine Melatonin Papaya, pineapple Ampalaya or bitter gourd and even by dissolving 2 tablespoons of sea salt in 1 glass of water, boiling it and breathing the steam. And to those who have none of the above, prayer to Yashua Mashiyach (Jesus Christ to many).
1/1	Many of the same people who are yelling that the vaccine is unsafe due to rare side effects are the same ones who downplay the risk of severe outcomes for catching COVID.
1/1	Many of those who dismissed Covid as a threat because it had a ‚Äú1% fatality rate‚Äù are now freaking out about the vaccine because it has a 1 in a million fatality rate. Seems people overestimate the risks of doing something and underestimate the risks of doing nothing.
0/-1	Many of you have also asked if you already have natural antibodies in your system, is this new vaccine better for those who‚Äôve already had covid?
0/0	Many people are complaining of side effects like dizziness, fever etc after this AstraZeneca (aka Covishield) vaccine.
0/0	Many people are reporting problems following vaccine.
0/0/0	Many people are tested positive after taking covishield vaccine
0/0	Many people are unaware that the COVID-19 vaccine has significantly more side effects than the flu vaccine.
0/0	Many people get hurt by medications. I was hurt very badly by a Pfizer medication. The one thing I have learned in this is that you have absolutely no voice. Nobody wants to hear about it. No doctors no media, nobody.
0/0	Many people had bad side effects ü§îmaybe he got the non killer one
0/-1	Many people have voiced concerns about how quickly the vaccines have become available, how short the testing process was, or how political the whole vaccine production effort has gotten because of the national election.
1/0	Many people i talk with at work have said they won't get the vaccine and it pisses me off because they in my opinion are no better than the people who don't wear masks and don't wash hands and are one of the major reasons the virus has spread‚Ä¶
0/-1	Many people seem to know now that vaccine is making more bad than help.
0/0	Many people suffering from multiple discomfort after taking the vaccine. My friend been complaining of headache, others have face weird discomfort like getting paralysed, some died after taking it, but not being reported and still pushing it. Protect the children from dehumanizing them.
0/0	Many provaxxers will never admit they were tricked in to poisoning their children because that kind of psychological toll is too much to handle & it‚Äôs easier for them to continue with the lie. The ego‚Äôs initial response is to protect itself first and foremost.
1/1/1/1	Many thanks for walking us through the process of mRNA and how the vaccine would work. This helps a lot to understand and bring people to get vaccinated.
1/1/1/1	Many thanks for walking us through the process of mRNA and how the vaccine would work. This helps a lot to understand and bring people to get vaccinated. Salutations de Montr√©al!
0/-1	Many times we don‚Äôt study what they are putting in our bodies.
0/0	Many vaccines are tested for years on animals before tried on the public. My concern with the new mRNA vaccines, which have not been tested for years in animals first, is that there is a possibility that in a year or two, there is a possibility that these mRNA vaccines could cause our own cells to become cancerous.
1/0	Many vaccines have a day of aches while our immune systems respond and learn how to conquer the virus. I've never experienced anything that couldn't be fixed with an ibuprofen.
0/0	Many will take covid-19 vaccine thinking they are saving themselves but the truth is they will be doomed forever
0/0	Many will take covid-19 vaccine thinking they are saving themselves but the truth is they will be doomed forever.

0/0	Many, MANY people have DIED from this shot, but mainstream CONTROLLED Media will not report this. YouTube will not report this. Only websites like bitchute, rumble, and brandnewtube have the evidence
0/0	Mark my words. Millions will take vaccine soon, hospitals will be massively overwhelmed with "adverse effects", they'll say they all have Covid (they do, they just injected it in them) and they'll fear porn and bring out military to inject everyone, resulting in millions dead.
0/0	Mark of the beast no vax for me thanks though

0/0	Mark of the devil
0/0	Mask, Hygiene and having a strong healthy immune system is the answer! ü•Ç
0/0	Masks don't work. This vaccine doesn't work.
1/1	Masks work because they prevent you from potentially spreading the virus by a lot, vaccines work because they prevent you from becoming severely ill. Ned changes the rules based on CDC guidelines. And vaccination efforts certainly help kill the spread. We're in a good place.
0/-1	Masks,vaccine and testing are a danger to your health. Covid is the least of our worries

1/1	May everyone in entire world will get vaccines before more lost of lives.
1/1	May the Lord God, who gives wisdom, have mercy on this vaccine and heal us
0/1	Maybe I should do a survey in my town on who was asked to do this so called survey probably zero.
0/0/0/0/0	Maybe because it is not a vaccine, we do not know the long term effects. A true vaccine is never rushed and since when has anybody cured a virus
0/0	Maybe because they created the virus in haste. And that made me doubt more the effectivity and the possible side effects of all these covid vaccine.
0/1	Maybe more than 50% don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want some rushed medicine injected into them without testing first ,and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good thing
1/-1	Maybe she should come work in the hospital with me then she‚Äôll see the proof of the pandemic
0/-1	Maybe the majority of Americans have been living with this virus and realize it‚Äôs not a big deal. Our household just got it and we took a hydroxychloriquine cocktail. Feeling great, nothing to see here.
0/-1	Maybe their idea of Phase 3 is releasing the vaccine & 'vaccinating' the civilian population ü§î
1/1	Maybe vaccines skeptics should just research it cuz the base of Pfizer is the same base in other common vaccines
1/1	Mayors, governors, the President, etc. should be vaccinated immediately. Regardless of their political beliefs its critical that the people running our governments are healthy and on the job. Remember what happened when Trump got sick? The Government went into free fall and there was serious concerns about who was making critical decisions. You don't want that even on a state or local level.
1/1	Me and 7 of my friends had the AstraZeneca vaccine yesterday and not even a sore arm in any of us. I‚Äôm so so happy to have had my first vaccine. #beyondblessed
1/1	Me and all my college educated friends have got it(and were fine), and all of my friends who are unhealthy, have less education, and are at higher risk for health problems are being ‚Äúfree thinkers‚Äù are not getting it. Survival of the fittest I suppose...
1/1	Me and my 68 year old wife are both fully vaccinated. It feels so good! Thanks for your part in trying to bring science to the table. We still mask and other interventions. We will get to the other side!
1/1	Me and my Mom will get vaccinated next week, it will be our first shot.
1/1	Me and my children are going to get the vaccine.
1/1	Me and my coworkers in the hospital will be finally able to get vaccinated. Leaving your home everyday to go to work knowing that you can get infected anytime is very scary, since we are running low on PPE. I'm tired mentally and physically and last month we had a meeting that we had to prepare for a next wave! Oh God when is this going to end?!!!

1/1	Me and my family are all getting vaccinated and guess what? Millions of people have gotten vaccinated and 99.999 percent of those people are fine. Stop spreading fear with your lies.
1/1	Me and my family have received both doses of the vaccine and we‚Äôre grateful for it. I‚Äôve lost two friends to COVID-19 in 2020 and I don‚Äôt want to loose anymore. The vaccine is here to protect you and your loved ones. These conspiracy theories are ridiculous. Literally every vaccine ever has been created in a lab just like this one
0/0	Me and my whole family won't take any of the vaccines, We only trust in God and no one else‚Ä¶

0/0	Me arm on fire had jab Friday and it's still throbbing terrible side effects, I won't reccommend getting it done,
1/1	Me as Brazilian looking to get any vaccine
0/0	Me personally I will pass. I am not anti vax, but I am not going rush into it neither. I have had 10 people i know perosnally get it and recover from it. if i get it i ll take my chances that my body can fend it off. There are also so many medical studies using other approachs to fight it off besides the vaccine. I think we have to stop labeling people as anti vaxers if they want to wait to see how things play out.
0/-1	Me personally, I don't recommend this but if it gets too serious, I suggests that instead of getting vaccine, we put in something that worsens the virus or health condition of someone for awhile and activate the corona virus to kill the patient immediately. Instead of letting it spread. I'd make the first sacrifice if I am the patient itself and we are desperate to stop this spread... I know, ppl do say I am only saying this because I am not infected, which is true. But if gets near to the end of the world by then, who cares right... Everyone dies by then if we dont solve the problem immediately like that, who knows it may even evolve right... Hmmm
0/0	Me taking it won't protect someone else's life. I'm a young guy in his 20s so the vaccine most likely won't save my life either. It might make it a more pleasant experience, but its not worth the risk of the hangover side effects. Human trials need 2 years to properly research potential long term effects anyway
1/1	Me too can‚Äôt wait till the 25th for my second dose!
1/1	Me too, like my 82 year old grandma, she said for the longest time she wasn‚Äôt going to get her‚Äôs then out of nowhere yesterday she called and ask us to get her one, I have no idea what made her change her mind but it made my day, she got her first dose today. I'm so happy
1/1	Me too. The moment it becomes available I will get it. It wouldn‚Äôt be approved if it wasn‚Äôt safe!

1/-1	Me: i am first Ohhers: not so fast
1/-1	Meanwhile at home trump has screwed up distribution so much we should have herd immunity in 10 years... it will be good to finally get real leadership at the top in a few weeks. So sad so many needless deaths from trump incompetence.
1/1	Meanwhile in Germany: 3% fully vaccinated after 3 months. What a joke. We have to get more vaccines out to more people!
1/1	Meanwhile, you have a 1 in 50 chance for an ischemic stroke(blood clot supplying the brain) with a covid infection. Of course, people(particularly anti-vaxxers) will somehow think that the risk of 1 in 1.1M somehow is comparable to 1 in 50 and would rather take their chances with a 1 in 50 risk than a 1 in 1.1M risk.
1/1	Measles and mumps are largely nonexistent because of vaccination.
1/1	Measles isn‚Äôt something to joke about. Please vaccinate.
1/1	Measles: I fear no man Measles: BUT THAT THING! a vaccine Measles: it scares me
1/1	Measuring vaccination rates by how many people have gotten their first dose is nonsensical. YOU NEED THE SECOND DOSE AND A FEW WEEKS AFTER YOU"LL BE IMMUNE!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	Media led people to their deaths! They insisted you take those dangerous drugs
0/0	Medical "scientists" , don't know how most Rx drugs work - they have theories about pathways being blocked or opened but not MUCh more.....That's why once an RX drug is FDA approved and then the awful effects unwanted start maiming people THAT's when it gets taken OFF the experiment on people/market...
0/0/0/0/0	Medical companies want the money and more money. They hide, do not tell the truth. They want to sell that vaccine = more money. But the vaccine is not safe. I do not want to be the one who died from vaccine.
0/-1	Medical professionals are getting a different COVID vaccine. They‚Äôre not getting the same one as the general public. My husband was having a chat with a consultant at our local hospital.
0/-1	Medical scientists should go back to class again, am sure God will give them more wisdom to come up with something more useful than before. we're bearing the pains of the cross Chinese gave us.

0/0	Minor side effect? Kiss my ass, I'm NOT having it. No, no, no. I can't smoke weed, but you can put unknown chemicals in my body? HA! It's a bloody joke.
1/1	Misinformation about COVID-19 is spreading faster than the disease. To save lives and stop the pandemic, we must protect the truth about vaccines.
0/-1	Mix and match the risks? No thanks. I preferred pick n mix when it was available.
0/0	Mixing experimental COVID vaccines in people in a very dangerous game when they know little about the long term side effects with these vaccines so far. How can the SAGE even consent to doing something like this?
0/1/1	Modern medical science has evolved enough! There is almost nobody in good health anymore...
1/1	Moderna Inc said on Tuesday that its COVID-19 vaccine still showed strong protection against the illness six months after people received their second shot, with efficacy of more than 90 percent against all cases of COVID-19 and more than 95 percent against severe COVID-19.
1/1	Moderna Vaccine works...,don't give a rats ass, About anything else. Get it to the People NOW ! TODAY! NOW!
0/0	Moderna coronavirus vaccine causes side effects in over 50% of patients; antibodies disappear in 2-3 months, rendering the vaccine pointless.
1/1	Moderna for my father in law and me today. Keep this going!
1/1	Moderna gang!
0/0	Moderna has no experience ever developing a vaccine.... covid 19 is the first and its all rushed.
0/0	Moderna have never produced vaccines, they are a Gene Therapy Company
1/1	Moderna is a smaller drug company so he needs to license his vaccine to the much larger drug companies like Merck et al! POTUS-46 should use the War Production Act to make more vaccine stocks. including starting today making the J & J single dose. which is more stable. That means it needs less temperature control. a great factor to more rural areas around the country!
1/-1	Moderna is good
0/0	Moderna vaccine = Gates vaccine. No way in hell take it. From the guy who says we need to depopulate and figure out a way to get people ready to not work anymore. Then the one group the virus targets is seniors All he needs is a chip in you. After he was caught laundering Money for Epstein and MIT corrupt scientist, he should not be allowed anywhere near medical research!

0/0	More BS from the CDC that wants to continue to control and manipulate people. If everyone is vaccinated they would still want you to wear not one, but two Masks. They are Hypocrites.
1/-1	More Dangerous than Covid.. We should vaccine for this too..
1/-1	More HPV vaccines = more lives saved from cervical cancer. Last year HPV vaccine production was expanded to reach 84 million girls over 5 years, and ultimately avert ~1.4 million cervical cancer deaths. Thank you to the manufacturers who have pledged to make this happen!

1/1	More good news - well done scientists! The more positive vaccines, hopefully the quicker it can be distributed to the worlds population
1/1/1/1	More good news, and this just further supports all the evidence. Sadly the image of this remarkable vaccine has been damaged in the EU - perhaps when they see 100% effective in preventing serious illness, it will encourage more to have it.

1/1/1	More vaccine for the rest of us
1/1	More vaccine to the ppl!
0/0	More vaccines = short term profits, More cancers = long term profits, The #Covid vaccines are being rushed. No long term studies of safety or efficacy. Population studies will be bypassed. Govts are also indemnifying Pharma against lawsuits Why?? Don‚Äôt be guinea pigs!

0/0	Most doctors in America should be put in prison for their lies. I haven‚Äôt taken a vaccine shot in 5 years and haven‚Äôt been sick. When I was taking vaccines, I‚Äôve gotten sick. Vaccines aren‚Äôt for everybody.
1/1	Most human advances & breakthroughs are at times of catastrophes.
1/1	Most important job of the year was just completed. Taking this young lady to get her first vaccine at the City College campus! By far one of the most important moments we've shared together.
1/1	Most medical colleges and professionals agree that what experienced is completely normal. Since the vaccine is only effective after the second dose, I would strongly recommend taking it. Both my brother and mother have taken theirs, I am waiting to receive mine, and I would recommend this vaccine (both doses) to anyone.
1/-1	Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated.
1/1	Most of my university allocations for students was the J&J vaccine. They all are fine; just a strong headache that takes them down for a day. Still better than getting COVID! Thanks Dr. Mike!üòÅ
1/0	Most of the ground breaking Vaccines such as Polio, Diptheria, Cholera were also new. No great deal taking this one. Anti Vaxers are just malcontents. Wouldn't matter what it was...they would demonstrate.
1/1	Most of the vaccines are targeting the spike protein, which is the protein the virus uses to enter cells. Although the virus doesn't appear to be mutating rapidly it's possible the spike could mutate. In fact the spike already mutated in mink in Denmark. One thing that's great about the Oxford vaccine and the mRNA vaccines is that they can quickly be edited to protect against a different form of the spike if necessary so a new form of the vaccine could be developed super fast rather than starting from scratch.
0/0	Most of these vaccines are faked...the plungers are in or empty and the needles are not going into the arm.
0/0	Most of those smeared as anti-vaxxers have no problem with a vaccine per se. What they do have is a problem with vaccination by coercion, and any future requirement to show evidence of vaccination to partake in normal life; via some app or e-certificate. Once this is normalised, it's a few short steps to a Chinese-style social control system. Even some distinguished politicians are worried.
0/-1	Most of us aren't anti-vaccine, we're just anti-stupidity‚Ä¶
1/1	Most people are very very bad at estimating odds. That's why they have built casinos and lottery :) I think saying 1 in a million to most people is not very convincing even though the risk of dying in a car accident while driving to get the vaccine is much higher.
0	Most people believe the most washed body part of 2020 was the hands. In actual fact it was the brain.
0/0	Most people i know dont want(or need) a vaccine
0/0	Most people recover from covid. These are not FDA approved!!! Don‚Äôt buy pharmaceutical stocks. This is about money, politics and control!
0	Most people who take this vaccine will be dead within 5 years! 4.2 million doses have been administered in the US!.So by 2025 the population maybe half of what it is now!
0/0	Most people will NEVER put that poison in their bodies!!!! I wouldn‚Äôt put that crap in my body if you paid me a million dollars!!!
1/1	Most people, I have talked to about the coronavirus shot told me there arm was sore and they had a mild headack. When the flu shot very first came out, I can rember people saying there family members died from the flue shot. But I still got it anyways and I did fine.
0/0	Most ppl in my college town are excited about getting the jab. After all my research, I'd never take this poison
1/1	Most strange how these vaccine doubters can worry about the long term effects of a vaccine and NOT worry about the long term effects of covid. If there is any risk of the former, I sure as HELL would choose it over the latter.
1/1	Most things we do have an element of risk of injury, for example driving a car, being a passenger in an aircraft, crossing the road, walking up steps, using pain medication, using antibiotics, using electricity or having a vaccination. The risk of blood clots appears to be about 1 in a million. No one can guarantee 100% safety but virtually all people understand the benefits far out weigh the risks.
1/1	Most vaccines are safe . Myself and my children have just about every vaccine available
0/0/0/0/1/0	Most vaccines are safe . Myself and my children have just about every vaccine available . Covid vaccine is too new . Let the people who think it's safe get it . I'll wait and see what happens .
1/1	Most vaccines present some temporary minor side effect. It beats getting the actual disease by far.
1/1	Most virologists believe Covid will be with us for our lifetimes. It won't ever go away, but we can ensure herd immunity is reached and enforced.
1/1	Mother Nature bans unvaccinated children from life
0/0	Mother in law only had sciatica. She has had paramedics 3x since having the Astra Zeneca. Chest pains. Massive swollen knee. And then a swollen tongue, she couldn‚Äôt swallow. Nobody wants to say the vax is involved here...it‚Äôs disgusting
0/0	Mouse to another Mouse " Are you going to take the Covid Vaccine?" Other Mouse, "Do you think I'm Stupid? They're still testing them out on Humans!"

1/1	Much better than the side effects of not having the vaccine.
1/1	Mum got the AstraZeneca vaccine an hour ago, all good. Such great news for everyone.
0/0	Murderers...it affects the enzyme P53 which is crucial to combat cancer. It also replaces the Natural immune system. It produces inflammation and increases infection. Cloughing problems show even in healthy people who have been vaccinated. And most of all it does not stop spreading infection. Vaccinated people still spread covid. Only relief the symptoms caused by covid. Is a mRNA Carrier to make you a genetically modified organism
0/0	My 27 year old sister took moderne vaccine. Days later she ended up in ICU for 8 days. She is better.. but she is seeing numerous neurologist to figure out why half her face and arm is still numb 2 months after taking the vaccine.
1/1	My 2nd dose of Moderna hit me pretty well. Shivers, mild fever, muscle aches, and a headache. Recovered fully the next day like nothing ever happened. Was totally worth getting the vaccine, and would do it all again to prevent from actually getting Covid.
0/0	My 5 month old niece is in the hospital with covid 19 she got from her mother who took the vaccine 3 weeks ago. Mother test positive now with no symptoms. Great huh? I'll be thinking twice about this and you should as well. Oh, and her Daddy came down with it yesterday ! Wonder how he got it...
1/1	My 53-year-old brother(both doses), our 78-year-old mom(both doses)and my 48-year-old self(first dose)have gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. With the exception of my brother having a sore arm for a couple of days, we're all doing well so far. We're in NE Tennessee.

1/1	My 73 year old husband had his on tuesday, not a single side effect not even a sore arm! Roll on mine!
1/1/1	My 83 u/o husband has had both shots and I have had the first. Neither one of us felt anything at all. Maybe we're just lucky. Don't let the worry about minor symptoms scare you off. A few days of feeling like you have a bad cold is a heck of a lot better than dying alone, (without your family or friends), in a hospital bed with no one but space-suited mystery people around you.
1/1	My 84 year old parents had the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine earlier this week. No side effects at all.
1/1	My 86 year old Mother and I had our Vaccine March 19th. Absolutely no side effects. Thank you for Science

1/1	My 90 year old mum has had it with no side effects and I will be having it asap!
1	My Doctors reply about my asking him about COVID vaccine. "I strongly recommend the vaccine. We have not had live through the small pox and polio thanks to vaccines. The Covid 19 vaccines are state of the art, safe vaccine. They were developed faster because of lack of red tape but not lack of safety data. Covid 19 Kills! Getting the vaccine will not only protect you but also your love ones( you will not be transmitting the virus to them)."
0/0	My Father met a doctor who cured his radiation on his neck in world war two! Hiroshima! He told my Dad back then if a vaccine comes out wait 24 months before you take it!

0/0	My God given immune system works better than anything you could possible offer. No thanks
1/1	My Grandparents both had their first COVID-19 vaccine a couple of weeks ago and they‚Äôve learnt lots of people are scared about having the vaccine. She says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had ours and we‚Äôre fine‚Äù & encourages others to get theirs done too.
1/1	My MD said it was up to me if I wanted to get vaccinated since I might not mount a sufficient immune response. Since the vaccine is made of mRNA instead of actual virus, my doctor wasn‚Äôt worried about it making me sick. So far I‚Äôve gotten my first dose last week and feel fine.
1/1	My Marine called - he got the first dose of the vaccine! YAY!!! He's been exposed twice, but did not catch it. But since he is in a hot spot area, it is better to be safe than sorry.
1/1	My Mom has got her first dose on Thursday- we are all so excited and relieved. And as a retired nurse she is well aware of what she is doing.
1/1	My Mom is finally getting her first dose today
1/1	My Mom is getting her second dose of Moderna sometime this month and it will take so much stress off of me. This past year has been Hell for me, she‚Äôs high risk and so anytime I‚Äôve gone to pick up groceries or had to go anywhere I‚Äôve gotten so stressed because I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for her death.
1/1	My Mum died from Covid today. It's a terrible way to die, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Please people get the vaccination.
1/1	My Mum found it no different to the flu jab, she felt a little achy for about 24-48 hour's but other than that she's absolutely fine. The alternative doesn't bare thinking about. I shall be rolling up my sleeve as soon as it's offered.
0/0	My Mum had the Covid vaccine in February, she's been ill ever since. 76 year's with no health issues all changed at a vaccine
1/1	My Mum, who is 74 had her vaccine last Thursday, she was so excited. She has felt a bit out of sorts but that hasn‚Äôt bothered her, she is looking forward to when she can give her Grand Daughters a big hug
1/1	My actual answer: Not immediately, because I'm young, healthy and I have a job that allowes me to work 100% from home. Therefore, I would like to make sure everyone who needs it more than I do has a chace to get a vaccine before me.
0/0	My advice is to use therapeutics that are available and 100% effective. DO NOT TAKE THIS VACCINE!
1/1	My advice... take the first vaccine you are eligible for... and at the first opportunity. Today I was vaccinated at my local pharmacy with the AstraZenica vaccine
0/0	My answer: Never ;)
1/1	My antivaxx aunt convinced my grandmother to not get the second jab and I managed to convince my grandma otherwise! I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs protected and safe!

0/0/0/0/0	My aunt took 2 doses of the vaccine and now she's really really sick. And then you see persons also dying, getting seizures and heart attacks. If they said it's a weakened form of the virus then how weaken is it?
1/1/1	My aunt who is 91 years old was vaccinated with both Pfizer doses. She needed a new pacemaker so per protocol, they tested her & she was positive for COVID. She never got a symptom & would have never known. So the vaccine did help her even when she tested positive
1/1	My biggest fear since the pandemic began was mum catching #Covid. She‚Äôs very much in the vulnerable category. I accompanied her today so she could get her #vaccine as she was anxious. I held her hand the whole way through. Such a relief!

1/1	My body, my choice. I chose to be proactive and protect myself by getting vaccinated. I'd rather risk getting a vaccine than a virus that causes blood clots, brain fog, lung damage, loss of taste and smell, even impotence. Some of these things can take months to resolve for a significant percentage of infected individuals.

0/0	My brother first child is not vaccinated at all. 3,5 years but he has the mind of an 8 year old. Not only does he speak Swedish his native tunge, but also is learning english via Youtube on the iPad. The other day I heard him singing "happy birthday" in Arabic, he must have learned at daycare..

1/-1	My child is dying of polio, but thank god he's not autistic!
0/1	My company is having a call next week with a doctor to convince us the vaccines are safe. I work with a lot of very smart autistic types if you know what I mean. I can't wait for the Q&A portion, if there is one.
0/0	My concern is by sending a message to your cells to replicate the "spike" and then to later attack that spike could be setting our bodies up for autoimmune disease
1/0	My concern is going to a vaccination site and then getting the virus there before the vaccine can kick in or getting the virus before the 2nd shot
0/0	My concern isn't that it will "change your dna," but doesn't it alter that process and the creation of cells for the rest of your life?
0/0/0/0	My conscience says do not take the vaccine

0/0	My coworker told me his cousin in Pakistan got her shot but she still got covid and went to ICU. Why did this happen. I thought the shot was supposed to prevent this
1/1	My current actual guess is that the best current coronavirus vaccines, like Moderna's, probably actually work, are probably safe, and ought to be for sale right now to anyone who wants to be part of the experimental group. #ChangeMyView #ButPleaseCiteStatisticsToDoSo
0/0/0	My current expectation is NO, however I live in Australia, where COVID-19 is virtually eradicated.

1/1	My dad and aunt got Johnson and Johnson last month. No issues still
0/0	My dad and his girlfriend got their shots and his girlfriend had to go to the hospital last night because her arm has been in really bad pain. Is probably going to be even worse when they go get their second dose. I tried to warn them but they do not believe me
1/1	My dad and his wife yesterday too! Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
1/1	My dad died from Covid, my wife is a mortician and has many ppl in her cooler because of this virus. My mom almost died and still has effects. I hope everyone does it, wish my dad had a few months for it to have came out.

1/1	My dad is half anti vacer soo when im 18 imma get a vaccine
1/1	My dad just got his vaccine! I am so relieved for him. I‚Äôm also super proud of him. He‚Äôs surrounded by a lot of people who refuse to get it and who believe COVID is a hoax. So his decision was controversial - but he did the right thing. Go papa!
1/1	My dad recently passed away due to covid, and it pains me to see people not taking this seriously
1/1	My dad said he didn‚Äôt quite feel himself for a couple of days but nothing major. Like he said ... I‚Äôd rather this than catching covid.
1/1	My dad was ill for around 2-3 days but he is definitely better right now. He said that it‚Äôs normal for people to get ill for a few days after a vaccination.

1/1	My daughter gets hers this afternoon. My husband and I in the morning. Please finish the 12-16 year old trials soon! But my goodness. How quickly it‚Äôs happened. My younger is getting three other vaccinations today. Just childhood stuff. Stuff we take for granted. So we‚Äôre ALL getting made healthier today and tomorrow. She doesn‚Äôt see it that way. LOL. Yeah, three needles. Five diseases she won‚Äôt get. How cool?? Maybe I can talk her sister into giving up her Kristy Kreme donut to her sister. :). Or just buying her one. Hell, for three shots, we‚Äôll get her three donuts. Three shots sucks.

1/1	My daughter lives in Spain with her Spanish husband and they are coming back for the vaccine in early May. Just line it up at Walmart or Walgreens in NC. Plenty of spots open. No residency requirements. No big deal.
0/0	My daughter works in an elderly facility. Three days ago they vaccinated the residents and 4 in her ward alone fell deathly ill. One had a heart attack. Many people in fact have died from this madman vaccine. Covid is a hoax and the vaccine will kill you. Don't be stupid.
1/1	My distinctly non-religious Dad will be going to church on a Sunday morning for the first time in my life this week. For his COVID vaccination. I couldn't be happier.
0/0/0/0/0/0	My doctor of many years who I trust told me to avoid the vaccine

0/0	My father died by a experimental drug given to my father by Pfizer
0/0	My father died from the vaccine, but nobody will take responsbility. I warn you all to not take any vaccine until more research has been done. It feels so rushed.
1/0	My father got the whooping cough when he was 7 and DIED! True story. He somehow was given 50 additional years of life through some miracle or deal with the devil, but later on his father ended up with polio! The ENTIRE family had to move to a city for treatment. I guess he was lucky because I don't recall him having any lasting medical problems. This is why my family vaccinates.
1/1	My father got vaccinated the other day. Good for him
1/1	My father had polio. It changed his life forever. A simple vaccination would have prevented a lifetime of suffering. Whenever I read people nay-saying vaccinations I am shocked at their lack of education and insight.
1/1	My father is a doctor treating covid patients. He has taken both shots of covishield and have got no side effects.
1/1	My father(a doctor) got vaccinated yesterday and he has been ill ever since. I‚Äôm honestly getting more skeptical of this vaccine because there have been many cases of people dying because of the vaccine. UPDATE: My dad was ill for around 2-3 days but he is definitely better right now. He said that it‚Äôs normal for people to get ill for a few days after a vaccination. So don‚Äôt worry about the Covid vaccine...
1/-1	My fever hit 101 a few hours ago so I took 500mg Tylenol. Feeling better. Drinking lots & was able to eat something. I have no regrets though. I would rather go through 24 hours of feeling ill vs getting covid.
1/1	My first AZ vaccine gave me a high fever and chills for several hours and then very tired the next day. I am 65 years old. I‚Äôm hoping the second shot will go easier
1/-1	My first Modena dose only gave me a sore arm. My second dose gave me chills, headaches and a slight fever for a day.
1/1	My first Pfizer dose left me a bit sleepy for a day. The second dose left me with "cold sweats," loss of appetite, serious exhaustion and flue like symptoms for two days. It was worth it. I'm 72 and interested to hear what younger people are experiencing

1/1	My friend did the covid19 vaccine yesterday and had no side effects.. I will do it too!
0/0	My friend died today after receiving the vaccine, 12 hours earlier. Shortness of breath with heart failure followed. She was perfectly fine. A teacher at the high school is in ICU after receiving the vaccine. So I ask you, are cases being ignored at this time to benefit the vaccine being used or are more people having side effects that are not being reported with the relationship to the vaccine?
1/0	My friend got the shot and tested positive for covid. Hasn't been sick in 10 years until the vaccine.

0/0	My friends baby died in her tummy after she got it..... and now she can never have kids again.
0/0	My friends girlfriend got it and woke up paralyzed the next day!!! Good luck with the experimental vaccine
0/0	My friends husband past away four weeks ago after his first vaccine and couldn‚Äôt get to the second. Wake up and realize that it doesn‚Äôt prevent you from catching the virus..you are their Ginny pig
1/1	My friends younger sister had a temporarily weakened immune system due to treatment for her skin, and she caught chicken pox from an unvaccinated kid who had gone to school without knowing he had it. This is a less extreme case but it shows how easily people‚Äôs choices effect everyone else.
1/1	My girlfriend and I just got out first Moderna shots last night!
1/1/1	My girlfriend is one of those shots getting her first dose. The last person in my life, outside of two anti vaxxers unfortunately, to begin their vaccination regiment. It will be nice to start seeing everyone again soon.
1/1	My girlfriend received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. And about a week or two after the second dose, she had contact with a positive patient at her hospital before they knew the patient had COVID. They called her in to do a nasal swab and the test came back negative. Take that for whatever you will. Its not guaranteed that she would've gotten sick without the vaccine. But I knew eventually this would happen. I knew that some day eventually she would be exposed without an N95/negative pressure room. And potentially drag it home.
1/1	My grandad has finally had his first Covid vaccine injection. It took long enough to get his turn but hopefully he‚Äôll be more protected if he needs to leave the house anytime
0/0	My granddaughter died of mass overdose of morpethean proscribed by a doctor over the phone she went to pick up the prescription and went home and taken the amount..next morning she was dead she was 24 with a child Doctors deny everything 2 year's its took to get them to take responsibility So what chance do you have with the vaccine

1/1	My grandma got Pfizer and got no symptoms whatsoever
1/1	My grandma had polio, had to learn to walk again, and then suffered from post-polio when older. Yet, members of my family don‚Äôt vaccinate their kids ü§¶üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è My brother in law has looked me in the eye and told me (an autistic person) that ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather just have my kids clean eating to stay healthy and not be all autistic and weird‚Äù
0/0	My grandma used to cut the mold off the commodity cheese before making our sandwiches. Pretty sure I‚Äôm going to be ok
1/1	My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
1/1	My grandmother got her vaccine a few weeks ago, and she‚Äôs doing well, all she got from taking the vaccine was a mild fever. It‚Äôs fine.
1/1	My grandpa came down with polio when he was 32. It just happened to be the same time that the vaccine became widely available. He declined to get it and spent a year in an iron lung and the rest of his life in a wheelchair.
1/1	My grandpa survived every common cold . What he didnt survive? Covid. It destroyed not only his body but also his mind. He no longer knew what year it was after being completely and mindfully there before. This virus stumped healthcare everywhere. Get the vaccine .
1/1	My grandparents (grandma has pulmonary fibrosis) are getting their first dose on the 12th. I'm extremely excited to be able to do more than a quick masked visit with them.
1/1/1/1	My grandparents are vaccinated nowü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

0/0	My guess is that the vaccine is ment to Keep us sick and dependant of more healthcare, i'm NOT getting it
0/0	My gut feeling tells me that the vaccine has to do with dna alterations. Beware!
0/0	My gut feeling tells me to wait. I‚Äôm not in a rush. I‚Äôve never had the flu vaccine and no flu since childhood.
0/0	My health is not right since i took the vaccine
0/0	My healthy nephew infant DIED 24 hours after his scheduled immunization.
1/1	My heart goes out to all the health care workers out there! I hope you can get your vaccine soon. Stay safe, and thank you for all you do!
1/1/1/1	My hospital gets our first batch next week and I‚Äôll probably get vaccinated in 2 weeks. Stoked. Hopefully no side effects.
1/1	My hospital is swamped with covid patients. We just emptied out another ward to accommodate more covid patients. And it‚Äôs not even winter yet. Every (living) patient I worked with last night had covid. At this point, I‚Äôm willing to gamble on a vaccine, because the odds of a negative side effect as bad (or as contagious) as covid are small.
1/1	My hubby and I had Covid Nov 2020. We had our 1st vaccine dose March 17th. We both had sore arms and felt a little flu for a few days, but no major symptoms and it was definitely not as bad as having Covid! We are scheduled to have second dose Apr 14th and will get the second dose.
1/1	My husband 75 and I at 69 took Moderna vaccine 2 weeks ago. We are looking forward to having 2nd vaccine in 2 weeks. Zero side effects

1/1	My husband and I received our first COVID 19 shot last week! We are so happy to have gotten it and look forward the second one. Thank you CDC
1/1	My husband and I received our second doses today. My parents and essential worker children have been vaccinated. I know this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without your leadership. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts President Biden
1/1	My husband and I will be getting the vaccine just as soon as we are contacted by our health care provider that it is available.
0/0	My husband and I will not be taking the shot because it was rushed to fast and we have been living in a tent for over a year.
1	My husband and his coworker just waited in line for over 4 hours but they both got their first dose of the COVID vaccine!
1/1	My husband got covid! He was really sick. I want the vaccine!!!!
1/1	My husband got his appointment through for tomorrow. I know more than a few who have had their vaccinations. Well done NHS.
1/1	My husband had Covid in March and almost died. He is still on oxygen. It's a terrible virus. I will get the shot when it becomes available.
1/1	My husband is 78 and will get his syringe today last March. I 75 have to wait my turn!
1/1	My husband is in the Oxford trial. He had a strong 36 hour reaction to the first shot but nothing to the second shot. Anecdotally that seems par for the course for that one. I think it's different for every vaccine and every person.
1/1	My idiot husband is a CT tech and is refusing to get it right now. Wants to wait to see how it goes. I'm an SLP at a hospital and I get it on Wednesday. Unfortunately, he sees 20x the amount of COVID patients I do.
1/0	My immune system does a whole lot better...without all the side effects.
1/0	My immune system does not need to be stimulated. I will not be taking this either..

0/0	My immune system is more effective than the vaccine. I'll take my vitamin D and zinc thank you for your concern.
0/0	My immune system is their for a reason,if someone chooses to receive it I respect that ,they better respect my choice also.
0/0/0/0	My immune system is working just fine.
0/0	My immune system responded quite nicely when I got covid and did it's job by defeating the virus. Didn't even have to inject anything into my body to trick it into producing antibodies. It did it all on it's own.
0/0	My immune system told me everything will be fine .
0/0	My immune system works better than any vaccine in the entrie WORLD
0/0	My immune system works better than any vaccine in the entrie WORLD!!!

1/1	My in-laws have their covid vaccine tomorrow (at @RJAH_NHS , I'm pleased to say!) and my parents, in the over-65s group, will hopefully be seen by the end of the month. It's such a relief to see those closest to us getting protection
1/1	My ist dose I don't Have sides effect same in my second dose .in I sleep good it's brieliant
0/0	My job is offering the vaccine on Thursday. I told them you will have to hold me down if you expect me to take it
0/0	My job offered me $500 to get the vaccine .. I‚Äôm still not getting that shit lol
0/0	My kid is perfectly healthy and he had no polio vaccine.
0	My kids will never be vaccinated and I will continue to fight for the choice to not vaccinate. After all the shots you give your damn kids, they will not be any better protected, all the while you are putting them at risk for everything else these vaccines cause.
1/1	My late 80s grandparents both just had their second dose of Pfizer and 60 year old mother had her first AZ a few weeks back. Feeling a lot better about the country opening up with all that considered!
1/1	My lovely in-laws got their covid vaccine today! I know how much it means to them - and have seen how much it means to the thousands of people who have been vaccinated across Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin. It's definitely a career highlight to be a small part of it.
1/1	My main concern is not whether or not I get infected, but whether I spread it to someone less fortunate.
0/0	My main issue it was rushed to the market for something that you have over a 99% survival rate. I‚Äôm not one of those the government is trying to chip us I just feel that I don‚Äôt want to be a Guenia pig to this vaccine
0/0	My mathematics teacher got sick from the vaccine, and my girlfriends grandma had a stroke 3 days after her vaccination. My uncle got sick from the vaccine, and so did one of my cousins. Idgaf what school requires, or what anyone says....im not getting that vaccine. Im just glad that i have the right to deny it, people in most other countries wont get that chance.....
0/0	My mindset is just to be last person in the country to get the vaccine. It would be selfish to deny someone the vaccine by being vaccinated ahead of anyone when supply is so limited. I figure 20+ years from now I might be within 10 years of being on a 5 year waiting list for the vaccine. But I will give up my place in line to the person behind me out of politeness.
1/1	My mom and all her friends are Facebook researchers and I‚Äôll never forget this one lady saying ‚Äúwhy do we even need vaccines, like, there hasn‚Äôt been a measles breakout in decades‚Äù like yes??? Because people were being vaccinated ü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏è people who spend ten minutes on google and think they have a better grasp on medical things than doctors that have spent years studying medicine never fail to make my blood boil
1/0	My mom and brother are probably going to take it but im personally gonna wait a bit and see if people start having issues or not, if noone had issues sure i'll take it
1/0/0/1	My mom and brother are probably going to take it but im personally gonna wait a bit and see if people start having issues or not, if noone had issues sure i'll take it but if they do i'll wait a bit longer
1/1	My mom and my grandparents got it a couple of days ago. I can‚Äôt wait to got mine **
1/1/1/-1/1/1	My mom didn‚Äôt get my vaccine very often and I always got sick, but recently she became full antivaxx that I now have to rely on my dad to help me get my vaccine. So antivaxx moms can say oh props to your mom, shut up, I recently got the flu because I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine it was horrible don‚Äôt put your kid through it!!!
1/1/1/1	My mom didn‚Äôt vaccinate me, I am proud to say as of today I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm 24.

0/0	My mom got transverse myelitis from a flu shot.. it has ruined her life...
0/0	My mom has SEVERE arthritis simply from a flu vaccine
0/0	My mom has said that she doesn‚Äôt want to take the COVID 19 vaccine. She says this is because the vaccine has ‚Äúkilled almost everyone who took it‚Äù.
0/0	My mom in LB received a whatsapp list of 10 categories who should not receive covid vaccine. It includes very random categories, like those with high blood pressure. As far as I know, only pregnant women are advised against it, or am I missing something?
1/-1	My mom in New York got hers. Honestly, she is who i was worried about. I'm young and I can handle the virus.
1/1	My mom is a nurse. When some of her fellow nurses received the first dose of Pfizer and Moderna, it was so effective that they didn't get covid even when their entire family tested positive.
1/1	My mom is a nurse. When some of her fellow nurses received the first dose of Pfizer and Moderna, it was so effective that they didn't get covid even when their entire family tested positive. Mind you the 1st dose only give you 50% protection. These two mRNA vaccines are revolutionizing vaccine technology and have no real competition
1/1	My mom is fine, and she got the vaccine months ago. My dad is fine, and he got it last week. Care to explain why nobody is dying to the vaccine besides allergic reactions? And I mean... of the vaccine, not getting the vaccine and dying of something random and unrelated the next day.
0/-1	My mom is very sick from her vaccine. It started 12 hours after first shot
1/-1	My mom received one of the trial vaccines back in the day. My grandmother signed the waiver because she had seen what polio could do to people first hand. Needless to say, my mom has been encouraging people to take the Covid vaccines ASAP.
0/0	My mom said her friends took it and some of them had seizures. I don‚Äôt think I am taking it.
1/0	My mom telling me conspiracy theories that the Covid vaccine will make me infertile. Like ok??? Two for one deal???
1/1	My mom texted me that she and my dad got their first COVID vaccine today. I never thought somebody getting a shot would make me happy.
1/1	My mom vaccinates me and I‚Äôm fine... I just have a panic attack every time I go to the doctor to get one bc I HATE NEEDLES anyways... VACCINATE YO KIDS
1/1	My mom was able to get it though. No signs of autism, but side effects included her cussing at the NFL game.
1	My mom was born in '55. When she was in the second grade she got German Measels followed immediately by mumps on both sides.. She barely survived so you can bet that I got vaccinated.
1/1	My mom, 74, but having been through 2 bouts of cancer so is at higher risk, just got her 1st vaccine Syringe dose (she lives in Oceanside, California). OMG the relief!! Folded hands #VaccinesWork
1/1	My mom, who is in her 90s and still quite sharp (and gratefully vaccinated against COVID-19, I will add), says that if people could remember kids sick with disease -- polio, measles, mumps -- it would be a reality check for the anti-vaxers. The fact that vaccines have worked and wiped out not only diseases but the memory of the horrible damage that polio can do is a double edged sword
1/1	My moms a healthcare worker and she‚Äôs getting her first dose of the vaccine today
1/1/1	My moms a healthcare worker and she‚Äôs getting her first dose of the vaccine today and she‚Äôs kind of nervous, thank you for this video it helps a lot
0/0/0/0	My mother died of covid one week ago 5 or 6 days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine...i will never take it
0/0	My mother got sick, and I know of two other people who got sick right after getting it. She had to get it for work, but NAH im good. That aint no coincidence !
0/-1	My mother got the vaccine and she‚Äôs been very sick I‚Äôm worried to death she has Covid.
1/1	My mother had polio Like many of her peers who contracted the virus it caused childhood paralysis. The vaccine iradicated it. #Vaccinate
1/1	My mother has MS. Her immune system is severely weakened as a result. Today she got her COVID vaccine. Today I am very thankful.
1/1	My mother in #PuertoRico got her second dose of the #COVID19 #vaccine today. She is also helping other older adults to get vaccinated. I cannot be happier.
1/1	My mother received her second dose about a week ago, and it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.
0/0	My mother told me not to get vaccinated, she hasnt done it, me and my wife or kids hasn't done it either. I have a bad feeling about this vaccine
1/1	My mother was a first time mother in the mid-late 90s, you know when the utterly horrific suggestive paper that linked autism and vaccines. She ended up being very very sceptical but when she saw that it wasn‚Äôt true, she got me and my brother vaccinated. Sadly for me, I wasn‚Äôt vaccinated for chicken pox and got it twice but I think it was mild because I didn‚Äôt get any complications from it. I was some what fortunate in that regard. At least my mum learned and got us vaccinated; although I did miss the vital ones like the mmr vaccines because I was in another country when I was supposed to get it. I got it when I could when I moved back to my home country.
0/0	My mother's neighbor, a healthy oncologist, had a brain aneurysm within a week of getting his vaccine. He died a few days later. No news report with him or investigation to see if his death was related to the vaccine. Just saying, there could be more unreported cases of this (or similar deaths) occuring.
0/0	My mother‚Äôs healthcare place called to get permission to give my 90-year-old mother one of the vaccines and I said no way
0/0	My motto is: No mask No Shutdowns No test, trace nor chip And they can take that poisonous vax and shove it up their butts
1/1	My mum and stepdad got booked in for their vaccinations at the end of this week. I turn 40 at the end of this month and it‚Äôs the best birthday present I could ask for! Thank you to everyone who is helping to fight this awful virus x
1/1	My mum got her Covid-19 vaccine today and I could not be happier
1/1	My mum had her first Covid jab today. Thank you #Science and thank you to the @NHS and all the volunteers helping to run the #vaccination programme. So grateful
1/1	My mum had her first dose of the #COVIDVaccine today! Her response on receiving it, ‚ÄúBrilliant. I felt elated afterwards, simply because it brings hope.‚Äù
1/1	My mum has had her vaccination...very happy. #CovidVaccine #AstraZeneca
1/0	My mum just had covid, and my auntie has it at the moment. It is people like you who are responsible for children losing their parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. Shame on you - listen to science.
1/1	My mum, who is on immune system suppression drugs, has just had a test to see if she has developed any covid antibodies, having been vaccinated 7 weeks ago. None. She has none. This is why everyone else has to get vaccinated. Please.
1/1	My nana had it a few weeks ago and is feeling fine
0/0	My neighbor who was a 85 year old woman died 15 days after the covid vaccine and that tells it all
0/0	My neighbour had the oxford poison, two hours later had a severe reaction, ended up in hospital for 4 days with bells palsy, in severe pain with permanent liver damage.
1/1	My old folks got it a week ago, going back in a couple weeks for round 2. Huge weight off my mind.
0/0	My only issue with taking it is whether it‚Äôs safe. Has safety been compromised due to the rush to get it out.
1/1	My opinion that appears to piss off everyone I know. I think if a parent doesn't vaccinate their kid then it should be an issue for CPS.
1/1	My other half just booked in for his jabs - there is a 12 week gap between first and second.
1/1/1/1	My overall opinion on vaccines is that they are good :D
0/0	My own doctor almost died after getting the vaccine. He advised me not to take it!
1/1	My parental grandmother had 6 kids. She once told me the happiest day of her life wasn‚Äôt when any of them were born. It was the day they announced there was a polio vaccine. She said was so relieved and thankful she would no longer have to worry about one of them dying or being a life long cripple from the disease. She died 10 years ago at 87. I wonder what she would think of those out there now that are refusing the Covid vaccine.
1/1	My parents (aged 72 and 74) just had their first dose of Pfizer vaccine!!
1/1/1	My parents always made sure I got the vaccinations that were necessary as a kid and I'm really glad they did.
1/1/1/1	My parents and my extended family will be vaccinated before I am as they all work as nurses at the biggest hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
1/1	My parents are in their 80's and have had the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. They only had the soreness they would have with flu vaccines, no other effects. They didn't take any aspirin or NSAIDS. My brother had a terrifying case of covid-19 and suffers long-haul effects. He says: "You don't want to get Covid!" I will get the vaccine as soon as I'm eligible.
1/1	My parents both got their first #COVID19 vaccine today. Such a relief.
1/1	My parents both have taken vaccine now, so excited!
1/1	My parents got their first dose of Moderna this evening. Grateful doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe how I feel.

1/1	My parents got vaccinated today. Every time I think about it, I cry. I am so thankful they made it. My heart absolutely breaks for all those with parents who did not.
1/1	My parents had their first recently, thank you to everyone in NHS and the Army as they are helping out dispense injection for them.
1/1	My parents have successfully had their first vaccinations üôåüèª Few side effects for Mam but otherwise all well & good! #vaccine #torfaen
1/1	My parents have taken Astrazeneca jab almost one month ago in Bangladesh and they are completely fine.
1/1	My parents just got their first #vaccine shots and I am so relieved Smiling face
1/1/-1	My parents took Covishield at one hospital but now that hospital has Covaxin as part of this updated list. Do these centres switch between these medication and is this list updated often? Would make it easier to know where to schedule the 2nd dose. Thank you.
1/1/1/-1	My parents vaccinated me. Now I'm an adult.
1/1	My parents were vaccinated and feel good about it
1/1	My partner is fully vaccinated against COVID. Words cannot describe how much relief I feel. I'm hoping it's my turn in the next couple months.
1/1	My personal opinion is that you should get the vaccine if it's offered to you. You're right the system is broken (corrupt governments etc), but you won't fix the system by skipping the vaccine. You passing up the vaccine won't necessarily mean it goes to someone who needs it more-- most likely it'll go to someone else who is in your same position (a friend of a politician who doesn't need it the most).
0/0	My plans are‚Ä¶ to not get the vaccine. Stop the bs propaganda.
1/1	My pregnant wife and I got ours a couple weeks ago, had a sore arm for a day or so, that‚Äôs about it. Herd immunity could completely eradicate this virus. Unfortunately looks like there are enough antivaxxer conspiracy theorists to ensure that the virus never goes away. Millions will die bc of some stupid facebook misinformation.
0/0	My private physician and his family of 4 all had Covid. Mild symptoms. He recommends the vaccine. I told him no thanks and he said yeah, it‚Äôs best to wait a few months. I‚Äôm waiting more than a few months.
0/0	My protection is the Lord Jesus Christ himself God did not have his hands in these vaccines I believe it in my heart and in my spirit God makes no mistakes!
0/0	My question is, how is it acceptable that the virus vaccine had been discovered immediately and is not a threat to human life while HIV aids had been there for decades without a vaccine to immune rhe human body form HIV? ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èFear the evil behind such vaccine. ‚õî‚ùå
0/-1	My question is, will the world be free from viruses after being vaccinated? Secondly, if this vaccine is good, why do you have to promote it, good things should not need promotion, automatically people will come together, let alone free.
1/1	My question to conspiracy believers is always: "How do you know for sure that your favorite conspiracy, isn't part of a another conspiracy to trick you into believing that conspiracy?"
0/0	My question why are healthy people suddenly dying after receiving the first shot?
1/1	My reaction is relief and joy. It appears worldwide prayers have been answered.
1/1	My reaction to those who refuse the vaccine is fine, more for the rest of us!
0/0/0	My reluctant in getting the jab simply because half the country vaccinated within a year of this pandemic starting so its definitely a no goer for me I still feel not a lot of research carried out and possible side effects later in life
1/0	My response to all discrediting the AZ vaccine: follow the money!
1/1	My sibling is anti-vax/republican etc. They tried to bully my 80 year old mom into not getting the vaccine. My mom, always silently defiant, just went out and got it anyway.
0/0	My sister got sicker and most women have gotten blood clots because of these dangerous vaccines.
1/1/1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
0/0	My sister is a nurse and one of my friends AND they will NOT take this vaccine! Me neither!!!!!
0/0	My sister knows two people in a nursing home that died an hour after taking the jab...........
0/0/0/0	My sister took the vaccine and she feels like she is going to die from the endless side effect that it contains and the amount that she experienced since getting vaccinated. She has already fainted and felt nausea a day after she took the vaccine.
0/0/0	My sister was deathly ill after receiving her 2nd shot, which is why Ive decided to hold off.
0/0	My sister-in-laws friend young in her 40‚Äôs received the vaccine. She went to the Doctor complaining that she wasn‚Äôt feeling well was having chest pain. They told her nothing was wrong with her. A week in a half after receiving the vaccine she died of a blood clot in her lung
0/0	My skin is the red line in the sand. Attempt to cross it at your own peril
1/1	My sleeve is rolled up.
1	My son & I are receiving our 2nd vaccine today!
1/1	My son and his 2 friends caught covid over Thanksgiving 2020. Thank God they are ok today. I was scared of the vaccines but I am more afraid of getting this deadly disease. I just got my covid vaccine. Stay safe all please get vaccinated.
0/0	My son developed autistic symptoms after receiving his 3rd grade vaccines. He was a happy child before that. Now he is non social and non communicative. Fortunately it's mild so he can function but I'm disgusted with people who hide and deny that this is happening. It's common sense that you don't inject chemicals into your body. Have you read the ingredient list in vaccines?
0/0/0/0	My son got the measles from MMR vaccine üíâ. My family got the flu from the free flu shot üíâ. And we will not be submitted to this evil.

1/1	My son is 11 years old . He will be 12 soon . I will feel so much better once he's vaccinated!
1/1	My son started his vaccine series 2 days ago. I am happy to report he has had zero side effects. The hub goes in today to start his. I'm feeling so grateful. My heart is full.
0/0	My son-in-law said he was reluctant to get vaccinated as he thought something like cancer in 10 years was a possibility and he is university educated.
0/0	My son‚Äôs girlfriend got her second Moderna vaccine today and she‚Äôs sick with a fever... she feels like she has Covid again.
1/1	My spouse being an antivaxxer would be a dealbreaker for me & I would literally divorce someone if they got this entrenched in antivax conspiracy theories.
1/1	My state has started allowing pregnant people and people with qualifying medical conditions to start signing up so I just completed the form to request an appointment tonight! It might be a bit before I actually get my vaccine but I'm excited to be a step closer!

Data, data, data; he was a real person, not a statistic. Be careful what you put in your body. No happy ending in my uncle's story. His name was Gordon

0/0	My understanding is that you have maybe a 2% or less chance of dying from it if you catch it, which means around 98% survival rate. So help me somebody, or isn't just taking your chances around 10% better than the vaccines? Maybe my brains is not working fast enough, not sure.
1/1	My vaccin on the 20th april
0/0	My vaccine is the power blood of Jesus. Amen Hallelujah
1	My very good friend died yesterday he was 48yo a care worker and leaves a wife who is a nurse and a wonderful daughter behind. Please please take the vaccine when available.
1/1	My vote is for the mRNA vaccine.
0/-1	My whole family don't use vaccine until it's been used and successful in short my fam doesn't want to take vaccines that are literally just made
1/1	My whole family got it and we are safe and free to get together and have dinners in each other‚Äôs homes. Go get the vaccine. Be an example for them
0/0	My whole family has now been vaccinated except me and my two young kids. They ask me why I‚Äôm not getting vaccinated? So many answers to give but at the end of day in today‚Äôs fake world with fake celebrities, fake news, fake politicians I trust myself and God first. #NoVaccine
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	My whole family has taken the vaccine and we are all fine. It was worth it for us because we saw what happened to family and friend that got CV19.

1/1	My wife & I got our Covid-19 vaccine today! No negative reaction at all.
1/1/1	My wife and I get our first on 3/31, my dad gets his first on 4/1, and my mom gets her second on 4/7 - all much sooner than I was expecting. Last November, I figured I wouldn't have a shot in my arm until the summer at the earliest, and now I'll be fully vaccinated (and near peak levels of protection) by the end of April. The process hasn't been perfect, but we're collectively killing it from a distribution standpoint. I can't wait until things go back to normal.
1/1	My wife and I got our 1st Moderna vaccination today, January 20, 2021.
1/1	My wife and I got our first shot Tuesday. It was such a relief.
1/1	My wife and I got the vaccinated today!
1/1	My wife and I received J&J vaccine 2 weeks ago and other than a stuffy nose for a few hours, we experienced no problems whatsoever. Very happy we got the shot.
1/1	My wife and I will be receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine on the 15th, can‚Äôt wait
1/1	My wife gets hers tomorrow and I get mine the day after. üòä
1/1	My wife got hers, she is fine. Been couple weeks now. Every person is bound to have many different reactions to any of the vaccines. I got my second Moderna today and no symptoms from 1st and none from second so far.
1/1	My wife got the Moderna vaccine 3 weeks ago and worst she had was a slightly sore arm for 2 days.
1/1	My wife got the vaccine today - she's a doctor in Birmingham, UK and the second person to get it in the area. She's volunteered to help administer and monitor people receiving the vaccine. Super proud of her.
0/0	My wife had her 1st dose yesterday. This morning she collapsed. GP said take her to A&E. She says she feels weak & headache. I don't know which vaccine she's had as its not written on card just her name & DOB! WTF? I'm beside myself.
1/1	My wife had the vaccine just over a week ago and she's been mostly fine. I mean apart from the fact that she's put pain to our Veganary by her lust for human brains √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏. (I joke of cause√∞≈∏Àú‚Äö)
1/1	My wife is a doctor , 31 y/o and had both pfizer. She felt tired and had some stomachache for two days after the shots , nothing more
1/1	My wife is getting her second dose of the Moderna vaccine this Wednesday! I only hope that I too can get vaccinated shortly!
1/1	My wife is in healthcare transporting covid positive patients every day. She comes home and is so exhausted. We are both so excited to know that this is on the horizon and know it's coming soon
0/0	My wife is pregnant, I don't want to let them vaccine my child, how should I proceed? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
0/0	My wife just told me two elderly residents at the nursing home that she works for have just died after getting the shot.
1/1	My wife who is allergic to near everything had little to no reaction on her second shot. First shot gave us both the munchies. I had no issues with my second shot. So dont freak yourselves out till you actually get symptoms. Ps, we are both 71.
1/1	My work sent an email today saying they were stopping the j&j and were only giving moderna. we were able to vaccinate so many people because of j&j. This is going to be a huge setback
1/1/1	Myself and my daughters all had Pfizer. My 17 year old had her first vaccine yesterday. They all wanted it and asked me to make them appointments. I was happy to.
1/1	Myself, I am entusiastic about the vaccin and will definitely take it. I want to be able to visit my grandchildren in England. I am also thankful that the British will lead and test the vaccin on the elderly in care homes in massive roll-out. This way, the rest of Europe will know if it is safe for the very old and vulnerable when we start our campaigns a month from now. Thank you!

1/1/1	Never have I seen such selfishness (and sheer stupidity) than I have in this last year. If you don't want the vaccine, fine. Move on with your life. Rather than jumping on the Internet to talk crap purely to frighten already scared ppl. If you think your immune system is just fine alone.. Great! Good for you! But maybe, just maybe, you could spare a second thought for those that don't! Those that have heart or lung conditions, the elderly, those that cannot afford to test their immune system against something that could prove to be deadly! You could get it, not know it and pass it on to someone who could die from it.. But at least you did OK, right...? Ffs.. I'm utterly sick of seeing ppl say "I'm alright" or ‚Äúit's just the flu‚Äú and try and ram down your throat the survival rates and statistics... (and I'd love to see that argument fly with those who have lost a loved one to Covid) . Of course ppl wouldn't contemplate a rushed vaccine. But their alternative probably isn't much better either!! Certainly not when half the population are selfish twats - its highly unlikely we can resolve this mess relying on those sorts of ppl either!

1/1	Next up is twice as many vaccinated as cases. Let's hope to hit that by the end of the month. And that rate of new cases just keeps plummeting, largely thanks to the vaccines, while the rate of vaccine doses given has been increasing in that same time. In the first week of January, there was an average of 260,000 new cases and 500,000 vaccine doses given every day. At the end of January, it was an average of 150,000 new cases and 1,300,000 vaccine doses given every day. It's kind of hard to overstate what a dramatic turn around last month was for the state of the virus in the United States. We went from the absolute worst of it to a precipitous decline that isn't showing any signs of letting up. We're a lot closer to the end than a lot of people are saying. This is very, very exciting.

1/1	Nice, happy to see the UK have a good vaccine rollout after the subpar management. Now let's get the rest of the world to the same place.
1/1	Nice, something good came out of it after all. If this technique works as good as they claim it will, then this is truly amazing. What a time to be alive.
0/0	Nice. You just changed your DNA mixed with RNA and other stuff we don't know. Atleast some people just... caught it and became immune or got their Blood type tested to see that they were immune to it. Taking that Vaccine without knowing the true side effect is not something to jump at. But to each their own
1/1	Nine months after I was a guinea pig for Oxford's coronavirus vaccine, I'm quite emotional that my parents are getting it on Tuesday. Last May, we knew nothing about it for sure. Now, we know it's safe, it's effective and it reduces transmission. I'm in awe of the scientists
0/0	No , definitely NO . Not been tested enough .

0/0	No I'm not getting it. Doesn't actually prevent you from getting it, it's only good temporarily, I've worked retail through the entire pandemic, never got it, and I've only had one flu shot in like 10 years. I think I'll be ok.

1/1	No amount of articles or common sense will change the average anti vaxxers mind. They've already decided vaccines are evil and are almost guaranteed to be too stubborn to sway their mind.
0/0	No amount of fear mongering, manipulation or intimidation will ever make me take this vaccine. I feel like I fully understand how bad it could damage me but I'm willing to take that risk to subvert from taking any vaccine. Something has been well off right from the start and I feel its all to do with China. I may not have all the facts, and I know I never will, but my gut is telling me not to take it, no matter what. It is no more or no less believable that this virus originating from a wet market in Wuhan than it is being released by the CCP deliberately, starting Bio warfare on a global scale. Most people will natural choose to believe what mainstream media has told them from the knowledge they got from a CCP bought WHO. I can't do that. I also find the fact the Chinese people very very conveniently are the LEAST effected by this virus.
0/0	No because everytime I did a vaccine i got the flu and I'm very young and it's better that people who works in the hospital and who really needs it does it before me.
0/0	No because personally I believe they could try and inject people with something that could kill them or just anything. Plus you could end up getting the COVID just like how you catch the flu from getting a flu shot.
0/0	No because vaccines per a study done by yale in 2017 were found to be associated with mental disorders. They postulate that the same immune cells you create to fight the disease also attack healthy cells.This virus only kills a fraction of a percent of people.
0/0	No body can believa a word this organisation says. These vaccines are only experimental and that makes them extremely unsafe to the point of being poisonous. We cannot sue the pharmaceutical company if something goes wrong so there must be something very wrong with them

0/0	No f'n way I'll get that
0/0	No for Covid vaccine now. This vaccine only took months...*months* to develop, not even a year. That's way too quick. Also, how do we know this isn't going to mess up someone's DNA? There's no transparency.
0	No guarantee of immunity! No guarantee of anything yet!
0/0	No harm from taking a poison... Did I understand this correctly?
1/1	No ifs, ands or buts. üíâ GO GET YOUR JAB! üíâ
0/0	No it bloody well should not!! Nobody should b forced to have long-term outcome unknown, so-called vaccine injected into their body against their will in order to go about their business. How soon the lessons of WW2 & Mengele are forgotten. We must be free to choose. Tests only
1/0	No it's common sense, why would i get a largely untested vaccine for something that has an over 99% survival rate for? I already had the virus and it was the mildest flu symptoms i ever had , and I'm immune now
1/1	No it‚Äôs not. It makes overwhelming sense to get vaccinated. You obviously know nothing about it.
0/0	No kid needs a vaccine!
0/0	No liability No chance of it going into me
0/0	No liability for manufacturers... Ruled "unavoidably unsafe" by US Supreme Court.. Covid vaccine does not protect from covid, from covid infection, from spread of covid, from covid transmission... DOES make record profits for manufacturers
0/0	No liabitlity in case of vaccine injury, you have to be crazy to take this shot.
1/1	No logical reason not to.
0/0	No long term data on anything regarding any of the vaccines - period. They have no idea if it will affect unborn children even.
0/0	No long term data... seems risky.
0/0	No long term studies. End of story
0/0/0/0	No manufacturer LIABILITY NO KNOWLEDGE OF LONG TERM EFFECTS Doctors can be taught lies and paid to say vcine is fine, but THOUSANDS of other health professionals have spoken against vcine with their livelihoods and reputation AT STAKE.
0/0	No manufacturer liability, NO trust. If the vaccine makers don't believe in the safety of their product enough to stand by it, why should we?
0/0	No mask or vaccine for me.
0/0	No mask, no vaccines, or no lockdowns for me not doing none of it
1/1	No matter what they say the antivaxiners..Im going to do the vaccine! ..I trust science and medicine more than them!!!!....
1/-1/1	No matter what vaccine you get , we have to see when this corona virus will stop its rapid mutation , if that not happening be prepared for yearly vaccination
0/-1	No matter what you may think of vaccines in general, it's very creepy how hard they're selling this. Best we can do is our best to inform ourselves from as legit sources as possible. Best to all.
0/-1	No matter where you heard that claim about the COVID-19 vaccines, it might be making you wary of getting vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn.
0/0	No mention of the fact that Moderna and others won't have any liability if the covid vaccine isn't safe and effective? No mention that it is essentially experimental? It takes years to develop vaccines. Now, all of a sudden it's important to make every American a guinea pig for Big Pharma?
1/1	No more masks and foggy glasses, I can't wait
0/-1	No need
0/0	No need for a vaccine i got antibodies
0/0	No need of this vaccine
0/0	No need vaccine only eat healthy foods that is the best vaccines
1/1	No negative effects please get vaccinated. I'll be first in line to get a jab.
0/0	No no no something is not right with this covid vaccine omg don't take it.
0/0	No no no. Just wait untill you got your second vaccine and than after few years than make a video..
0/0	No not yet, it's too soon to tell if this vaccine works or if it's even safe.Even if it is proven safe and effective I am not sure I will get one,, I think each person should decide for themselves if they need it or not.
0/0	No offense, but my immune system has been doing pretty good for over a half a century. I‚Äôm gonna stick with it, thank you very much, though. I heard a rumor a while back about ‚Äòmy body, my choice.‚Äô. I heard another rumor as well. It‚Äôs called the #2ndAmendment m#%ther f#%cker!
0/0	No one believes the vaccine will work well
0/0	No one has any idea of the long term effects.. This is still in emergency trial stage.. not approved by the FDA.. yet is being forced on us!! We turn our TVs on everyday with medications being recalled and lawsuits on the manufactures.. but yet again this is still being forced on us.. when we know the long term effects.. then this can be a requirement.. not until! If you want it.. go for it... if not.. it‚Äôs ok also! This should be a personal choice!
1/1	No one has died from the vaccine while many people have died from covid
0/0	No one has had the vaccine in their body for more than eight months (as of late December 2020), so the honest answer is we don‚Äôt know yet if these vaccines cause long-term problems
0/0	No one in our large extended family would take the experimental shot for a million dollars and we think money is nice.
1/0	No one in their right mind would let someone stick them with this rushed vaccine. Scientists tested these vaccines properly for saving human lives. Some filty people are spreading negative comments and influencing other people
0/0	No one is getting the proper medical care during this vaccine push. They just care about sticking a needle in people and pretending they are fixing a problem.
0/0	No one is going to force me to take it.
0	No one is ‚Äúanti vaccine‚Äù, they are just concerned about a rushed ‚Äúunproven‚Äù vaccine.
0/0	No one knows because it is a biologically engineered viral weapon. Boost your own immunity
0/-1	No one knows the long term consequences of getting the vaccine
1/0	No one knows the long term effects of altering carrier dna. It's not just that its new...it's that no one can predict what the long term effects will be. And not just for our generation.
0	No one needs the vaccine, but all these sheep want it like it's going to help them. Ha! You know what does help? Not being obese and old :D
0/0	No one on this earth can make me have this experimental jab. No way!
1/1	No one said vaccines were totally safe, but, they did say that you have a significantly increased chance of survival just by getting them.
0/0	No one should be tracked or forced into vaccines. The governments already starting to control us. There making us wear masks, making us stop working, making us social distance. The governments controlling our lives and it‚Äôs crazy!
0/0	No one should support the governments attemt to inject us with some untested crap!
0/0/0	No one should take the vaccine.
0/0	No one wants this non vaccine!
0/0/0/0	No one wants to be a lab rat for the next thalidomide.
0/0	No one will be experimenting on me or my family
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	No one will be experimenting on me or my family, take it to the bank.
0/0	No one will ever convince me enough to take that killler vaccine.
0/0	No one with a brain would take a 'vaccination' developed for a virus (weapon) that appeared a year ago. I'm going to wait and see what happens.
1/1	No photo, but Ken and I were vaccinated Saturday (Pfizer) at the local cottage hospital. Perfect organisation, no side effects apart from a bit of a sore arm late in the day. All gone now. Go get it if you can!
0/0	No plans on getting a vaccine. Latest I saw IFR was around 0.15%, and flu is 0.1%, so it's only a little worse than flu.
1/-1	No point in dying now....my sentiments exactly
0/-1	No point risking it. 99.90% of people will survive without the vaccine and the high riskers can get it and do their thing.
0/0	No preventing this natural part of evolution people . Let it run it course for crying out loud .
1/1	No problems with the vaccine just like getting the flu jab
0/0	No proof covid exist at all, nor did the vax manufacturers have the virus. Nothing to do with a virus in that concoction.
0/0	No questions, just don`t do it! With survival chances better then 99.8%, it makes way more sense than an unproven vaccine!
0/0/0/-1	No scientific proof' really means there's no money in the answer so we're not paying for the research
0/0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine.
1/1	No serious safety events relating to the vaccine were observed during Phase 3 trials, with the shot ‚Äúwell tolerated‚Äù across different dosing regimens
0/0	No shot for me!
0/0	No side affects at all if I choose not to get vaccinated. Never had a flu shot before and never will! 99+% survival rate.....hope people can soon get that!
1/1	No side effects from the vaccines as I can see

0/0	No sources or citation, random biased information. Dont take the vaccine, fight for your rights, love thy neighbor.
0/0	No still don't feel comfortable. üòí

0/0	No thank you. 99% survival rate and every one panicking.
0/0	No thank you. I'm not afraid of it. I do believe that it was not properly tested nor in development long enough to know how effective or safe it is.

0/0	No thanks! I don‚Äôt get flu vaccines and I will not be getting this one either. The majority of people I know are not interested in this vaccine. The general reaction is why would I get a vaccine for something that has a less than 1% fatality fate.

0/0	No we just don't want the endless side effects a rushed through vaccine could give us.
0	No you don‚Äôt need to know long term ! Just take a look at short term for yourself and you will say no to start with, then no having to consider long term.
0/0	No you shouldn‚Äôt take it. Coronavirus is fake and doesn‚Äôt exist so that means the vaccine is to make people sterile, or it‚Äôs a lethal injection, or it‚Äôs an rfid chip. But it‚Äôs not any kind of cure. People better use their brains
1/1	No you‚Äôre looking at it the wrong way. Why don‚Äôt you try to find evidence that they are harmful to begin with? There is no reputable scientific document that calls into question the importance and safety of vaccines. The only issue lies in that if you have allergic reactions to it or something from issues with your immune system. The one article where all this started has been redacted and the researcher himself redacting his conclusions. I‚Äôm saying this for your safety, get vaccinated
0/0	No!
0/0	No! I am not so sure it works,l saw and see many complications from vaccines.
0/0	No!! I dont really understand, why you need to be vaccinated if you have strong immune system? We dont know yet the side effects in a long run of that vaccines.
0/0	No, I am waiting for Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs special panel of experts to approve this. Remember, he said we couldn‚Äôt trust any vaccine that came out under the Trump administration.
0/0	No, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs safe, too much rushing to get the product out. No long-term trials. I do not trust it. I do not trust the process.

0/0	No, I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months. Gee, what could go wrong?
0/0	No, because I believe that the virus really isn't a thing.
0/0	No, don‚Äôt trust that shit at all
0/0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune.
0/0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune. My wife caught it in Spain while we were travelling in our camper van for three months and I did not have very much reaction to the bug at all while she was quite ill for a while and we lived as closely as you can get in a tiny space.
0/0	No, in fact the opposite is true: there is NO vaccine -- mRNA or not -- that has been proven to reduce deaths from C-19. The confidence intervals for all vaccines include 0% decrease.
0/-1	No, it doesn't - not for young people or healthy people. Generally I believe that +90% had it with a high amount of ones who did not even know. From a small 2 days cough to no Symptoms or same as a cold - it has everything.
0/0	No, no, the vaccine doesn't make you safe, only the vaccine passport will be able to do that.'
1/0	No, they contain adjuvants which may or may not consist of involatile mercury derivatives that are incapable of causing the same chronic, deleterious effects of regular, purified liquid mercury. These adjuvants typically act to elicit an inflammatory response that "jumpstarts" your adaptive immune response into creating memory B and T cells which respond to the viral (in this case) antigens that are injected through the vaccine. Later on, your body retains these memory cells and is able to mount an even more effective and rapid response that essentially prevents the pathogen from colonizing your body effectively and causing severe damage to your tissues. Additionally, a lot of the mercury-based adjuvants have been phased out in favor of modern adjuvants with more effective ways of coaxing the human inflammatory response. None of these have been shown, in the hundreds of thousands of trials tested and billions of people administered on, to contain stem cells or directly harmful ingredients. The worst case usually results in an attentuated, live strain randomly genetically reverting from a non-infectious strain to one that can actually infect and spread from its host. However, this is rare, and the current COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any viruses, just the mRNA which produces spike proteins, which are harmless on their own and rapidly degraded by the body. Hope that clears some of it up. -Microbiology PhD student. Feel free to ask more questions and I'll try to answer as best I can.
1/0	No, they take years to develop because of funding, not looking at long term effects. Once the vaccine is gone from your system, very quickly I might add, it can't cause any other effects. So stop lying.
1/1	No, they're not. These vaccines went through the exact same process that any other drug goes through. It went faster because the vaccines had top priority and were able to jump the line ahead of every other drug the FDA was evaluating. In other words, no steps in proving effectiveness or safety were skipped. These same mullets who are saying they don't trust the vaccine are the same ones that demand we "listen to the science". Oh the irony.
0/0	No, vaccines take years to make also it was rushed so
1/1	No, you are not too busy to schedule and get a vaccine. Nope, you are not. You ARE too busy to get COVID. And other people are definitely too busy to get COVID because of you. #GetVaccinated
0/0	No,I will not. The current vaccine prospects are being rushed through trials exceedingly quickly, and as such their safety will be far from proven when rolled out.
0/0	No,I‚Äôm planning on getting the disease, if I can find someone actually sick with it.
0/1	No. First, because everytime I did a vaccine i got the flu, second I'm very young and it's better that people who works in the hospital and who really needs it does it before me. I really wonder why people online are always pro at vaccine and are scared to go out/judge other people that don't stay at home/take extreme measures to be safe and in real life people live as always and don't want to get the vaccine (:
0/0	No. I care about my health. I have no intention of receiving any vaccine. I remain vaccine free. I remain sickness free.
0/0/0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven‚Äôt heard anything positive
0/0	No. I have done enough research to know that this is NOT about a fake zombie apocalypse virus.
0/1	No. I haven't had the flu in over 20 years. (I had one flu shot). I rarely get a cold. I rarely get sick. I have a very good immune system and healthy constitution. If I get Covid-19 then I get it. But until then, I'll do what I have to do to look after my body and strengthen the immune system as it hasn't let me down yet.
0/-1	No. I think vulnerable groups should have it first and I'm 67 and thin so no risk. Secondly I believe natural infection is more protective and re-exposure boosts immunity.
0/0	No. It takes 10 years to develop a vaccine as it takes 10 years of clinical trials to deem a vaccine safe.
0/0	No. It was rushed to market with less than 6 months of testing, the only vaccine in history to be approved in less than 4 years. It was approved only because of the ‚ÄòCovid emergency‚Äô.
1/1/1	No. I‚Äôm done wearing a mask as soon as vaccines are widely available, and there‚Äôs nothing that anyone can do about it.
0/0	No. I‚Äôm healthy. It‚Äôs not necessary.The epidemiology data here in Australia shows that COVID19 presents as a mild disease, except in extremely rare cases for the elderly with chronic health conditions.
0/0	No. I‚Äôm not in a high risk group and I have serious concerns about the expedited nature in which these vaccines have been produced. We better hope like hell there aren‚Äôt any long term side effects, because while we can make educated guesses and we can ‚Äúhope‚Äù, we simply do not know in the way that we do with other vaccines that have been approved after 10 years of trialing and clinical testing. And anyone that isn‚Äôt appropriately skeptical of profit motivated legally insulated pharmaceutical companies and governments with a clear economic and political incentive to produce something that can be sold as a safe, working vaccine is far too trusting.
0/0	No. No. And No. thanks
0/0	No. No. No. F that vaccine.
0/0	No. Not at all. I will not get vaccinated.
0/0	No. Not yet.
0/0	No. Stop im not having it go away
1/1	No. There is nothing in the vaccine that could "infect" someone. Please stop with the BS.
0/0	No. They. Just want to kill us! This is not a joke!
0/0	No. it was rushed to market with less than 6 months of testing, the only vaccine in history to be approved in less than 4 years. It was approved only because of the ‚ÄòCovid emergency‚Äô.
0/0	No.. Because I don't trust. because vaccines take 5 to 10 years to make, not 9 damn months
0/0	No...Never...Not me!!!!!!,
0/0	No...no....and no........
1/-1	Nobel Prize
1/-1	Nobel prize worthy. Decades of science, research, and battling uphill quietly led to the miracle of this vaccine.
0/-1	Nobody dropping dead in the street Nightngale hospitals never used, number of deaths and cases fiddled...cases means nothing. Just a bad flu from which 99.7 % of ppl recover. #CoronaBollocks
0/0	Nobody in my family has got the vaccine nor do we care to do so. We don't get flue shots either. If you feel better getting it go right ahead.
1/1	Nobody is injecting nanotechnology into my body. PeriodT
1/1	Nobody is safe till everbodybis safe should be the adage and having artificial age restriction would be counterproductive.Let all age get vaccinated pronto!
0/0	Nobody is taking any vaccines in my family foolish people
0/-1	Nobody is taking vaccine don‚Äôt believe the news
0/-1	Nobody knows about the long term effects of this vaccine Same story over and over again.
0/0	Nobody knows how safe is the vaccination just because we have no long term study! This is the very first vaccination in the history without long term study. This vaccination had a 6 months compared to other vaccinations 1-2 years study for long term side effects.
0/0	Nobody knows how safe it is! That‚Äôs the big punchline! Get it? Wake the F up people!
0/0	Nobody knows the long term effect because no ones had these vaccinations in them that long one doctor has said it could lead to different cancers I've been walking around in this pandemic for a year I'm fine I'm taking no experimental vaccine god will protect you and your family
0/0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern
0/0/0/0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern.
0/0	Nobody needs any untested vaccination for a virtually harmless virus
0/0	Nobody needs this toxic cocktail. Covid has a 99.7% recovery rate even without intervention. This is the definition of crimes against humanity.
0/0	Nobody should be getting this "vaccine" end of story!
0	Nobody wants that vaccine except a percentage of Sheeple. Witches Brew!
1/-1	Non of the thing you listed will keep them for spreading the virus. Yes, you have ‚Äúrights‚Äù but every right also has corresponding Obligations and Responsibilities.
0/0	Non of what the government says. Once a liar always a liar
0/0/0/0	None of my family will take this posion . It is that simple . Exile us from society. If so stop all taxes and do not step foot on my land or the dogs will be released
0/0	None of the manufactures are liable for the vaccines they produce. So if you get any negative side effects its is not their responsibility. So why should I trust them if they have no liability what so ever or reasons to make sure it is safe. Since they have immunity for any negative consequences.
0/0	None of them look so healthy to trust them. I think they spread the virus and than they vaccinate us these mutants.
0/0	None of these are safe.
0/0	None of these vaccines should even be on the market. They‚Äôre going to have severe outcome so you can‚Äôt reverse. Just watch the world population drop in the fall. Watch.
0/0	None of those people who would like to stay alive and healthy should take the vaccine
0/0	Nonsensical scientific analysis which is under fraudulent information by a suspicious so called a professional Doctor,i have no doubt WHO gave u money to lie to the global community,u r a foolish idiot miss from hell,sies u r not ashamed of urslf
0/0/0	Noo I don't want to get a shot it's hurt
1/1	Noone is forcing you. However, it was tested. Take a wait and see approach. But don't condemn the work of scientists and medical professionals. Without it, nothing will change but more deaths.
0/0	Noone with half a brain would take this bill gates poison
0/0	Noooo don't take that you will get an autism chip
0/0	Noooo thank you
0/0	Nooooo Bill Gates chipped the vaccine, now government will now everything about you!! No more pirated office on your laptop!

0/0	Nope not getting it, hell I never got the flu shot and only got it twice.
0/0	Nope not gonna get the vaccine
1/0	Nope they don't have to talk to me at all. My body already produced what was necessary to fight covid. I don't want synthetic garbage in my system. Worked to hard to build a good immune system.
0/0	Nope! It's not going to stop..its only going to continue until people submit themselves to the "Jab!" It's called Controlling People!
0/0	Nope!! My Body My Choice............ so NOT going into me!!!

0/0	Nope, Moderna has never produced a successful vaccine to now... I'm quite sure all the Trumper's will be first in line
0/0	Nope, Someone else can have mine, It was rushed, Not FDA approved, And liability wavers, No Thankyou.
0/0	Nope, and if it's mandatory I'll find a cave to live in
0/0	Nope, im good...
0	Nope, not ever taking that stupid vaccine. I was born with a imune system for a reason.
0/0	Nope. HARD PASS!!!
0/0	Nope. It's not even a vaccine by definition.
0/0	Nope. Logically speaking, if todays vaccine hasn't eradicated your flu illness, and doesn't prevent you from getting it and dying from it. We can conclude that back then wouldn't make much of difference either Also, there's alot of factors, living conditions, diet , when the spanish colonist arrived that's when it spread.
0/0	Nope. My children will not have it. There is zero research about how children will react to it.
0/0	Nope. Passing my vaccine on to the next in line.
0/0	Nope. still not getting it. Hell I get a reaction to the flu vaccine since they added swine flu to it years ago. Prior to that no reactions.
0/0	Nope.. if u gotta force ppl to take it or tell me I can‚Äôt fly or go here or there wout it then this is more then a virus ü¶† Even if President Trump told me to .. there is no way.. God gave us an immune system and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for.. üëç

1/-1	Normal Life will soon return. Just keep doing what‚Äôs important. Please üôè
1/1	Normal Life will soon return. Just keep doing what‚Äôs important. Take your shot!
0/0	Normal vaccines require 8 to 15 years of rigorous testing! So far no mRNA vaccines have passed the animal testing phase....but this 10 month old PfizerBioNTech/Moderna "non trials tested animal" vaccine is safe for humans. What could possibly go wrong. These evil b-tards will do anything for power and money!
1/-1	Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
0/0	Normally I'm an anti vaxxer but this experimental jab, the first of its kind, made in a matter of months, entire testing phases skipped, results based on tiny samples, from a company who've paid out billions in compensation, with all legal safeguards removed, for a virus with a 0.14% fatality rate, has really got me tempted!
0/0	Norway Sounds Alarm As 23 Elderly Patients Die After Receiving Pfizer Vaccine
0/0	Norway have had 26 people die from the Vaccine , And now Rumers of UK deaths from the Vaccine are also coming to light .
0/0	Norway patient died after being injected with covid 19 vaccine
0/0	Not FDA approved so how can one say these are safe and effective? If I tried to peddle a product I created as safe and effective for xyz ailment and it wasn't FDA approved I would be in trouble! I guess the most corrupt government agency gets a free pass on lies. What's new.
0/-1	Not Satisfied your information
1/1	Not a conspiracy.
0/0	Not a risk I‚Äôm willing to take when I‚Äôve already survived the virus , I trust nature over science any day , science is never exact , as we are seeing with all the problems
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Not a single chance in hell I will take this mandatory or not
0/0	Not a single chance in hell I will take this vaccine
0/0	Not a single person should be taking this poison
0/0	Not a vaccine at all, it‚Äôs designed to put a nano chip in you . 5 g will activate it
0/0	Not a vaccine... this is mRNA gene editing
0/0	Not accept the vaccine due to safety concerns.
0/-1	Not an anti vaxxer but the vaccine seems kinda suspicious
0/0/0/0	Not an anti-vaxxer. Just not happy to be a guinea pig.
1/1/1/1	Not anti vaccine or anything and I plan on getting the covid one
0/0	Not anti vax!!! Pro science, pro freedom, pro choice, pro life, pro evidence, pro morals
0/0	Not approved by FDA or Health Canada (only for emergency), trials not over yet. No thanks.
0/0	Not confident that the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. is taking the needs of Black people into account.
0/0	Not confused about this vaccine but I do believe that it will mess up our DNA No thank you
0/0	Not consenting to take part in a medical experiment where the manufacturer has ZERO LIABILITY if you die and does not intend to publish SAFETY DATA for two years does not make you anti-vax - it makes you ANTI-STUPID.
1/0	Not dumb at all but I think platelet abnormalities DO occur during natural infections, with pretty much every virus under the sun.
1/1	Not dutch but an immigrant from the UK. I will definitely get it but I don't mind waiting a bit for the people who really need it to have it first.
0/0/0/0	Not enough money in the world to make me get a corona virus vaccine.
0/0	Not enough testing was done, so we don't know how this will affect anyone
0/0	Not even FDA approved. Y‚Äôall are promoting poison. Already seen one person I know personally get sent to the hospital due to complications from the vaccine. She‚Äôs paralyzed on the right side of her body.
0/0	Not ever taking that vaccine
1/0	Not everyone wants that crap, for a disease that has a 90 percent cure rate.
0/-1	Not everyone wants that vaccine.
0/0	Not everyone who refuses to get COVID-19 vaccine are anti-vaxxers. There is a reason why vaccines normally take years to test and produce. This whole rushed process of less than one year development makes me question the legitimacy of the COVID-19 vaccine specifically. Not vaccines in general.
1/1/1	Not feeling quite this fresh today but glad to be moving forward #vaccine #worthit
0	Not for me thank you. I have a God given immune system and I do not consent. But hey, to the presenters of this video, don't let me influence you...enjoy your jab.
0/0	Not for me thanks.
0/0	Not for me. Get ready for zombie apocalypse
0/0	Not for me. Give the injection to the the government
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Not for me. Start getting ready for the zombie apocalypse.
0/0	Not for me. The positives they argue are extremely vague while the adverse effects are visible and clear. It's like Clint Eastwood and now the government is saying "Do You Feel Lucky Punk?" I'll get by with your Black Seed Cumin and Honey before getting the jab.
0/0	Not friendly to some people have long illness
0/0	Not friendly to some sick people
0/-1	Not get the vaccine until they remove the waiver period
0/0	Not getting a shot for something I have 99% chance of surviving

0/0	Not getting the vaccine and the only mask I wear is thinner than paper also I just wore that mask through the airport and nobody said anything
1/1	Not getting the vaccine because you‚Äôre worried about potential side effects is like not eating because you‚Äôre worried about choking to death
0/0/0	Not getting the vaccine, never had a vaccine and I am perfectly healthy and fine!
0/0	Not getting the vaccine, never had a vaccine and I am perfectly healthy and fine!.

1/-1	Not good news, at the moment. Safety first.
1	Not had a single death from clots in Wales but have over 5500 deaths from covid19. Had both my jabs with no side effect so Bravo UK.
0/0	Not having it ever!
1/0	Not having the vaccine does not mean that covid 19 will kill you once infected, so the jab should be optional.
1/1	Not immediately, because I'm healthy and I have a job that allows me to work 100% from home. So I have the illusion, that I'm not in immediate danger and can be without it for a while. Also, others will need it urgently and it is safer for me to wait for the dust to settle. In the medium term I will definitely want to get the shot as I'm organizing community stuff, where I do meet plenty of people. Also, I think sooner or later you'll have to present a certificate to have been vaccinated for travelling internationally. This is already the case for many countries for yellow fever.
0/0	Not in a million years i take the poisson shot , you can take mine
0/0	Not in any hurry to get the vaccine. I'll wait until I'm forced, coerced, pushed into a corner, threatened to lose all my freedoms, until everyone who wants it has had it. At the point I have no choice any further, I will get the J&J vaccine instead of the M&P one, that is of course if "they" allow me to get the vaccine they do not "prefer" we get. I had something I thought was the flu in late December 2019, I later grew to believe it was Covid. I lost my sense of taste and smell and only recently have those two senses started to return. I am an 82 year old female, I think my immune system kicked in just fine and I got through the Covid in about a week of feeling lousy.
0/0	Not in my body. Don‚Äôt trust them
0/0	Not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to lack of trust.
0/0	Not interested in any of vaccines ,ill best die naturally then be your gineapig or zombie mode luminati based vaccines ,if we dnt take we cnt use our money wtf youll playing God seriously satanist all of youll
0/0	Not interested, I survived covid19 with home remedies so I don't see any reason to be vaccinated.
0/0	Not just clots! It is the dangerous combination of clots with low platelets! It is deliberate misinformation to compare clots from contraceptive use and this reaction from vaccine. The increasing instances of of this complication only becoming apparent. Govt spin reproduced!
0/0	Not listening to this bs it‚Äôs totally not safe
0/0	Not me or my family!
0/0	Not me, never!!
0/0	Not me, not here, not now, not ever.
0/0	Not me. That's for damn sure.
1/1	Not my turn yet. I will be vaccinated when it is available for me.
1/1	Not news to me. I‚Äôm a HCW in a small acute hospital and two staff have already told me they‚Äôre not sure they‚Äôll have it. I said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll knock you over running to be first in the queue to get it‚Äù.
0/0	Not on their life I'm gonna take that damn vaccine! LOL
0/0	Not once Dr.Fraud-ci interview with the REAL DOCTORS who will lay all the facts out and tell him the truth! All they are doing is promoting vaccines for this so called FLU virus.
1/-1	Not one rational reason left to not unfreeze the import of vaccines, get Pfizer, moderna, Sputnik and johnson and johnson in, let the rich pay more their vaccines, allocate the 3000 crores to ramp up Covishield, let go of central control over vaccines or
0/1	Not one rational reason left to not unfreeze the import of vaccines, get Pfizer, moderna, Sputnik and johnson and johnson in, let the rich pay more their vaccines, allocate the 3000 crores to ramp up Covishield, let go of central control over vaccines or allot by case load. Now.
0/0	Not only allergic reaction. It can damage your nervous system for good. Known as Guillain Barre syndrome. And your doctor will say, it's a rare neurological disorder.
1/1	Not only are anti-vaxxers spreading lies and misinformation, they‚Äôre also spreading the virus and increasing the odds of vaccine -resistant mutations to occur by giving the virus more chances to replicate and thereby more chances to mutate and find a partially vaccinated person or a vaccinated person with a compromised immune system, where it can develop into a vaccine resistant strain.
1/1	Not only does it not have such a high survival rate, but you seem to be mistakenly thinking as long as you don‚Äôt die from it you are fine. It causes serious long term health issues if you do survive. Get your jab
0	Not only in germany who have this problem ,i dont trust any vaccin ,and why over 60 very stupide,im not taking IT
1/1	Not only is providing vaccines to the rest of the world the ethical thing to do, it‚Äôs the only way we can tamp down the global burden of COVID-19 enough that we ourselves are safe.
1/1	Not only protecting yourself but others that you care about too!
0/0	Not peer reviewed or through regulatory approval yet - a bit of patience is due!
1/1	Not positive but PRETTY SURE my husband, who is a quadriplegic, now qualifies to get the vaccine ü§û There are some (small but) alarming studies about spinal cord injuries and COVID-19 mortality rates so we‚Äôve been holding our breath until he‚Äôs vaccinated. Hoping to exhale soon.
0/-1	Not really... Let the people take the vaccin who is voluntary want it.. Don't force the people take vaccin then that is fair.
1/1	Not rich enough, or old enough to get a vaccine, anytime soon. Rough estimates for me, and my family are April. So damn frustrating losing everything, while watching some folks that found a way to get go back to normal. That‚Äôs great for the people that are following the guidelines. Not everyone is. Watching younger folks that got it because their family has hospital administrators, bs like that doesn‚Äôt really help my faith in humanity. It‚Äôs still about who you know. The ‚Äúextras‚Äù are told to people, so they‚Äôre in the right place at the right time. I‚Äôve been told my life doesn‚Äôt matter, and I believe it when I see people skipping the line. By the time some of get help, it‚Äôs not going to matter. We‚Äôll be out on the streets. It‚Äôs really hard, after a year of isolation, to not hate everyone.
0	Not safe enough for me to put it into my body
1/1	Not saying this is the right way to do things, but hopefully US continues to ramp up its production of the vaccine even after a majority of its citizens get vaccinated.
1/1	Not scared of getting sick myself, but scared of infecting others. I want to be able to meet family who are in the riskgroup!
0/0/0	Not sure COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to combat the virus.
1/-1	Not sure this is the case. My work sent 22k 1a invitations, and about 8k people scheduled a vaccine. There is undoubtedly hesitation on the part of many people, even in healthcare.
0/0	Not sure to take this vaccine. A friend of mine is dead for the vaccine
0/0	Not sure what's in it but I'm not doing it.
0/0	Not takeing it noob ha ha ha dont take nobody covid fake belive me it took 1 year not good 10 years that what it take for the vaccine

0/0	Not taking an experimental drug
0/0	Not taking an experimental drug. My body is not a clinical study.
0/0	Not taking any of the stabs under any circumstances.
0/0	Not taking any of the stabs under any circumstances. Not interested in playing Chinese Roulette with my life. The ones hesitating or those downright refusing here, there and everywhere probably have come to the same conclusion.
0/0	Not taking any vaccine might save your life.
0/0	Not taking it and shouldn‚Äôt be forced too they got y‚Äôall where they want ya this isn‚Äôt going near my kid or me been taking care of myself all my life I pay my taxes keep your guns people
0/0	Not taking it at all.
1/1	Not taking it into your body is your absolute right. I HAVE had my first shot. I am 76 yrs OLD. LOL I won't live for ever but don't want Covid either.
0/0/0/0	Not taking it. Go ahead - make my day!
0/0	Not taking it. Turned it down twice. Overhyped flu
0/0	Not taking the Covid vac
0/0	Not taking the mystery ingredients of that vaccine, period!.
1/0	Not taking the virus is like peeing in the pool. It is your choice but it ruins it for everyone. We need segregated "pools" for the unvaccinated. Separate but equal restaurants, gas stations, etc for the dirty butts.
1/1	Not that I have a choice, but I'm going to wait until healthcare, first responders, seniors, veterans, etc have gotten it first. Hopefully I can get the shot by next December.
1/0	Not the vaccine but the transport. Also they have only been approved for emergency usage.
0/0	Not to mention it‚Äôs the only vaccine in history to not have a long term study control group before it hit the market. Also the fact this is also the first vaccine in history to ever use ‚Äúmrna‚Äù for an ‚Äúessential vaccine (like chicken pox, tb etc). Two huge firsts for mankind.
0/0	Not to mention that any even considering taking this vaccine should read up on what RNA is and how it basically directs the DNA structure. You may not be concerned with how an untested mRNA vaccine will alter your DNA, being that as an adult, you are likely fully formed, no telling how it may affect you, but a young child? Or have you considered what the most minute alteration to the structure of YOUR DNA may affect any offspring? Myself, I am beyond that concern, still there is no way I will take that or any other vaccine!
0/0	Not too bothered about the 'after jab' effect but I have chosen to decline the vaccine, as have other family members. Good luck to all making their choices.
1/1	Not too worry, at this rate of roll out there will be a lot of vaccine varieties by the end of the year or first half of next year
0/0/0	Not trust doctors and hospitals.
0	Not unless I am given a list of every single ingredient in the vaccine. And because I ask for the list of ingredients they must comply. The reason for asking is they have a tendency to put in additional ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù ingredients on vaccines that actually cause health problems.
0/0	Not until it is safe for the most vulnerable kids to be there, no. Not until it is safe for the kids with the highest incidence of asthma, blood Pb levels, PFAS exposures, and other environmental injustices that dangerously complicate their COVID risk exposure.
0/0	Not until it passes actual long term testing for potential future unknown side effects. The fasted a vaccine ever got from research to market was 15 years. To push it like this is absolutly reckless and borders on malpractice for political gain. Makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it.
1/1	Not using rhe AZ vaccine is madness. This is an unprecedented health emergency and now some governments are getting as hysterical as the anti-vaxxer nut jobs.
0/0	Not vaccinated and wont be. I have been living my normal life and will continue to do so . No mask no social distancing. Been with family as much as usual. Noone will keep me from my family
0/0	Not vaccinated, and nothing is stopping me from going back to "normal"
1/0	Not vaccinating your kids only works fine so long as everyone around them IS vaccinated.
1/1	Not worried, we get the flu shot every year one more won‚Äôt make a difference. The more protection the better for us
1/1	Not you all thinking you know more than thousands of scientists, doctors, and researchers with PhD's who all agree that it's safe
1/-1	Nothing about the Anti-Vaccine certificate protests in denmark i see
0/0	Nothing about the long-term effects the culling begins
0/0	Nothing anyone will ever say will make me get it.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Nothing beats a strong immune system. There is no money in it.
0/0	Nothing beats the immune system. Especially young children. Deal with the sickness If and when they become Sick.
0/-1	Nothing but complete madness. Learn the truth about the vaccines. It‚Äôs all on my Twitter page.
0/0	Nothing but propaganda! The vaccines are not safe and were created for evil purposes. Only God can help us now!
0/0	Nothing can prove that the product being injected to these people is the very vaccine. They are being given a different substance but they want to persuade us with the fake posts and later inject us their real vaccine which may be or is mere poison... Beware of such fake promotions...
0/0	Nothing changes in terms of rules whether you are vaccinated or not. Granted are your chances of catching it are dimished as are your risk of being very sick, but at what cost? Still too much is not known about these vaccines. Of course not everyone is at high risk of catching it either.
0/0	Nothing from the government or their appointed scientists
0/0	Nothing is free in the world and by taking the vaccine you essentially become the product!
1/1	Nothing is perfect . people can also die from flu shots
0/0/0/0	Nothing like living in a free country! This is the start of the mark of the beast! Sheep wake up
0/-1	Nothing says confidence in their vaccine quite like lobbying to make themselves immune from lawsuits. It's a real confidence builder for me!
0/0	Nothing scarier than a vaccine that took less than a year to manufacture. Most vaccines take years to perfect. I just hope we didn't rush this too much.
0	Nothing to say about all the side effects sending people to the hospitals ?
0/0	Notice how Thomas Reuters & Facebook are fact checking anything that speaks out against this vaccine? No surprise to see both of them are listed as partners on the World Economic Forum website along with Pfizer...
0/0	Notice how he laughs when talking about vaccines, evil creepy satanist. A big NO from me.
0/0	Notice how the government is not telling us to consult with a doctor before taking the vaccine üíâ you have to be a different kind of stupid to take a rushed vaccine.
0/0	Notice how they call it a "jab" now, to make it sound like some routine thing we had as kids to keep the lergie away, as opposed to an experimental gene altering injection.
1/0	Notice the groups of people who are never involved with anti vaxxers. Doctors, virologists, chemists, teachers, scientists
1/1	Now I will get J&Js
0/0	Now I‚Äôm definitely not getting it Poison . DON‚ÄôT TAKE IT. You‚Äôve been warned...
0/-1	Now here we go again: "the benefits of the vaccine outweighs the risk for the VAST MAJORITY of the people"! and how people should know if they belong to the "vast majority" or to the "rare minority"? People SHOULD be given full discloser about potential side effects, and THEY should decide for themselves IF they should, or should not take the vaccine. As far as I know, there is no test offered before taking the vaccine to determine if the person about the be vaccinated blogs to the "vast majority" or not! then how can a doctor give the advice to anyone, "you SHOULD take the vaccine because the benefits outweighs the risk for the vast majority of people"? are you suggesting the person whom you telling these words is part of the "vast majority"? you know that as a fact?
1/1/1	Now i realized that vaccines really give us the immunity from the sickness rather than not having vaccinated...Thank you so much Doc.for that very clear information...God bless i more
1/1	Now if only I could get my vaccine in my area in San Antonio, Texas 78233! I wish I could cut in line like these celebrities. Lol
1/1	Now if only the general public can get vaccinated before summer that'd be great.
1/1	Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1/0	Now lets eradicate HPV , AIDS ETC :)
0/0	Now lets wait 10 years to see are there any sideeffects and maybe then i will take it!
1/1	Now let‚Äôs hope we have the staff to carry out the huge vaccination programme needed.
0/0	Now our wonderful MPs are going to ‚Äúmix‚Äù the vaccines? Come on people surely this is the final straw, surely enough is enough? This mixing and matching has to be ‚ÄúFrankenstein science‚Äù?
0/0	Now our wonderful MPs are going to ‚Äúmix‚Äù the vaccines? Come on people surely this is the final straw, surely enough is enough? This mixing and matching has to be ‚ÄúFrankenstein science‚Äù? And yet the sheeple sit watching bbc and Eastenders! ‚ÄúStill think it‚Äôs a pandemic‚Äù?
1/1	Now prick me already. So ready for this shit to be over.
1/1	Now that there's a vaccine, everyone that takes it will be 100% immune and will no longer need to social distance or wear a mask!
1/1	Now that vaccination has started we are closer to the end of this era
1/1	Now that we are starting to see positive results from the vaccines, I'm excited to watch the fight over who gets to claim credit for saving the world. One thing history has taught us is that it will definitely NOT be the people who actually did all the work.
1/-1	Now that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs dangerous to get vaccinated but you have to trust other peaple who are able to get vaccinated to get vaccinated
0/0	Now the real pandemic is going to start.
0/0	Now they are trying to justify why they went after our DNA using the PCR test. Caught. Stop lying. We're not brain dead. You wish!
0/0	Now they want to mix the vaccines? My dear God!! It's all a horrible experiment!!!
1/-1	Now this is a Professor more people should listen to. To set them at ease about the Vaccine that has been developed. Great information.
1/1	Now this is a good quote to put risk in perspective: "You have a greater chance of being in a car accident on the way to getting this vaccine than you have of having a problem from this vaccine."
1/1	Now this is the good news we have all been waiting for.
0/1	Now we have the most rapidly produced vaccine in history for a virus that is already mutating.
1/1/1/1	Now we just need a vaccine for stupidity!!! Looking at you antivax people and you "covid isn't real" people :)
1/1/1/1/0/1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types!
1/1	Now, should I be in the US/much of Europe where the virus remains rampant, then I‚Äôll certainly take the first vaccine being offered for the risks out there is far greater than the risks of the short trial and follow up periods of the available Western vaccines.
1	Now, the world is still a nasty crazy place out there, we need a lot of courage and we need a lot of resilience after that, and we will fall down before we stand up‚Ä¶ What really matters is the silence of the night in our conscience. We cannot control what happens but we can use what happens. We have so much reserves of love and support inside us, if we can just remember that in our mind and move on.
0/0	Now, you can't go on a cruise without the vaccine....guess I'll never cruise again.
0/0	Nueman\n against Adam both are of the same tribe and both playing both sides of the chessboard.
1/0	Number of confirmed #COVID19 cases:105M Number of COVID19 vaccine doses given: 120M Number of PROVEN DEATHS from COVID-19: 2,292,100 Number of PROVEN DEATHS from any COVID-19 VACCINE: ZERO I hope this puts things in the right perspective. Thank you. #vaccineswork #getyourshot
1/1	Number one, practically the whole world has been working on the vaccine so they've been able to share notes
0/0/0/0/0	Numerous people have already died from this vaccine and the corrupt agencies will never admit it.
1/1	Nurse had to hold my hand...√∞≈∏Àú‚ÄöI had yet to get the second part...did u guys take vaccine?
1/1	Nurses and people in the medical industry are already getting vaccinated by the way. The data shows that everything goes as expected.
1/1	Nursing home I work at has had zero cases among staff or residents since the first round of vaccines. Just got our second round last week as well. Morale is way up and the results have caused some vaccine doubters among the staff to sign up for the next vaccine round in two weeks. Definitely light at the end of the tunnel
1/1	OF COURSE I BLOODY WILL!!!! I‚ÄôD BE STUPID NOT TO. Only an idiot wouldn‚Äôt want to try staying alive and seeing his children marry and his grandchildren grow up.
0/0	OK LETS PUT THIS WOMAN TO THE TEST. WILL SHE TAKE LIABILITY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE VACCINE AND DIED?
1/1	OMG I'm sooo excited for this vaccine. Hope it comes soon man
0/0	OMG again use Africa for test!!!UNICEF business for wrong vaccine !!!!!
0/0	OMG how many times do people need to be told. The current vaccine doesn't stop you catching it, spreading it or dying from it!
0/0	OOOOPS you didn`t even bother to test it...I say LIARS and DESTROYERS....do your research
1/1	Of course I will take the vaccine. It is significantly safer than many other previous vaccines. The side effects are like the other vaccines as well. So vaccines are the best there is.
1/1	Of course I will. I will not hesitate to get my vaccination. It is time to get contro9l of this pandemic and move on. This country is going to fail if we do not get our economy going again. We already have hundreds of thousands of businesses that have failed and more going under every day.
0/0	Of course NO!
1/1	Of course everyone should be vaccinated.
0/1	Of course it is. None of these Vaccines were given the proper amount of trials and time to study it which regularly takes at least five years. But to each their own, I just won‚Äôt be your test dummy
0/0	Of course it won‚Äôt hurt you immediately duh üôÑ. The side effects kicks in later.
1/1/1/1	Of course it's safe! There's a chance you might get an allergic reaction, but it'll be over in mere hours!
0/0	Of course it‚Äôs moronic. Kinda like needing a vaccine for a virus with a 99.9 survival rate but here we are!
0/0	Of course people don‚Äôt want to inject a rushed product into their bodies.
0/0/0/0	Of course people don‚Äôt want to inject a rushed product into their bodies. All the old vaccines are fine. They‚Äôre tried and tested but this new one might be risky
0/0	Of course side affects are minimal now. Give it time. It takes an average of 10 to 15 years for a vaccine to be proven safe and effective. And through this trial period volunteers have died and suffered to ensure the safety of a vaccine. This experimental jab which is unproven is no good. Don't be a guinea pig.
0/0	Of course the cases have risen. They‚Äôve been ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô. The same thing happened in the UK. Their deaths went up horrifically in Jan-Feb, France ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô later so their surge is Feb-March.
0/0	Of course they are hesitant it‚Äôs literally killing people
0/0/0	Of course they lie! This vaccine is not about covid at all! These are vaccines of dehumanization. You will no longer be a divine creature. If you survive, you will become a toy in the hands of the enemy. Controlled and weak-willed.
1/-1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!!
1/1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe.But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
0/1	Of course we show videos of the anti-shot takers only saying vague things (probably scripted) and not listing the real reasons, and also making it a race issue (even tho they already told us previously that the majority of the black community doesn‚Äôt want to take it). The media once again: Trust us. No one else. Just us. Don‚Äôt ask questions. Just stick this fluid in your body. Believe only the ingredients we told you are in there and nothing else.
1/1	Of course we will get vaccinated! There is no vaccine that provides 100% protection and unfortunately there are some that get serious side effects. But we must all be helped to stop the shit
1/1/1/1/1/1	Of course you should get it. What kind of nonsense question is that?
1/1	Of course, every sane person do vaccinate
1/1	Of course, in 1918 the population of the USA was about 103.21 million, while now it is 330.66 million, roughly three times as high. To lose the same proportion of people as in 1918, we'd have to hit a death total of about 2,025,000. Let's pray the vaccines do their job.
0/1	Of course. If you decide not to please stay home for the foreseeable future. It's irresponsible to possibly put others at deadly risk.
1/1	Of the 30 most vaccinated countries, 20 are in the EU. They are doing fine.
0/0	Of the alleged 650,000 ‚ÄúChina Flu‚Äù deaths .....how many can be attributed to the Biden vaccines?....70%?
1/1	Ofc no vaccine is 100% effective but this one could have saved her life or prevented severe disease. Still important to remember that these mRNA vaccines are some of the best on the market.
1/-1	Ofcourse you could get minor symtoms similar to the ones you get when catching covid, thats kind of how a vaccine works
1/1	Off to get my final Pfizer vaccine!!! I‚Äôm so lucky!! I will still wear my mask!!
1/1/1	Off to get my final Pfizer vaccine!!! I‚Äôm so lucky!! I will still wear my mask!! #vaccine
1/1	Off to get myself vaccinated! Let's do this!
1/1	Often a single dose is enough to stimulate long-term protection
1/1	Oh Yes, I got my 2nd dose thursday and went to bed that night. Woke up at 3A.M. with horrible body aches that lasted for 24 hours. But it was still worth it.
0/0	Oh and i hear it can have some awesomely fatal side effects how cool!
0/0	Oh and you can die and it is experimental and you can develop horrible adverse effects. We know this is about money and power and control!
1/1	Oh boy I can‚Äôt wait to get mine
0/0	Oh boy, 96% effective and lasts 6 months for a 99.9% survival rate virus, makes sense.
0/0	Oh boy...three injections is really three chances to play Russian Roulette with your immune system. Be wary.
1/-1	Oh come on! No one has to vaccinate their kids! only those you want to keep!
0/0	Oh dear EUronews, this article hasn't even made it to the end of the day before the conclusions it tries to draw are shown invalid. Studies released today have conclusively shown 1 dose provides 76% efficacy for up to 12 weeks and validate the UK strategy of prioritising the first dose. Nice try lads.
0/0	Oh gosh, those vaccines are not ready for human trial
1/1	Oh how the years have changed me. Now when I get excited about shots, it‚Äôs the vaccine kind. Ready to get my second
1/1	Oh just stop it! Comparing the various brands is just going to slow down the roll-out! I would happily take ANY vaccine I could get into my arm
0/0	Oh look! 90% of the comments on this feed are "conspiracy theorist."üòÑ Just because the media of all sorts are in on this covid hoax does not make it so. COVID IS A LIE! DO NOT TAKE THE "VACCINE!"
0/0	Oh look, it‚Äôs Bill Nye, Propaganda Guy.
0/0	Oh lord. At least they‚Äôre not rushing to get their babies vaccinated for a shot not FDA approved yet
1/1	Oh man do I miss those polio drops. For some reason I liked the taste so much that I'd keep asking my mother later if I could have some more.
0/-1/-1	Oh man, my dad is getting the shot right now. I'm so worried.
1/-1	Oh man, the day I took vaccine shot, I slept for 10+ hours stat, such a relaxing sleep in months
1/1	Oh my. I feel AWFUL after the vaccine. And that is just a GLIMPSE of the full thing. Thank god i got the vaccine.
1/0	Oh nice, another Vaccine i wont be able to get.
0/0/0/0	Oh nooo people don't want to get an unproven and actually potentially dangerous vaccine for a virus that has a lower mortality rate than the flu nooooo
1/1	Oh now the anti vaccine idiots are at it. These are the people that help perpetuate diseases because they allegedly "know better" than science or medical professionals
0/1/0	Oh okay you are one of those who believes there is such a thing 'herd immunity'. There is no scientific evidence to suggest herd immunity can be obtained by vaccines. At best it is an observation which has become dogma as much of the science is with vaccines.
0/0	Oh shite, "hang on," really? I go to a pub where no one has worn a mask for a year. What bullshite and when does this television drama (fictional soap) end? Do people really still believe this Event 201 shit show debacle is real?
1/1	Oh thank gosh. Finally!! I‚Äôm so excited. As soon as my parents can get this vaccine, I‚Äôll finally feel like I can relax a bit
0/0	Oh well it must be all good then....if they tell us so then it must be fine....nothing to worry about....just obey and get in line
0	Oh wow... these doctors are literally lying to us. Let‚Äôs talk about how this is an MRNA injection. Not a vaccine. It‚Äôs a fact that a vaccine needs to be tested for 5 years or more. You doctors are lying through your teeth. Profit is more important to you than health. Ashamed.
0/0	Oh yea get the whole world trying experimental gene altering vaccines. Sounds like a great idea
0/0	Oh yeah make your appointment today, oops it's been paused due to being poison, hahhahahaahahh
1/1	Oh yeah. Get that immunity!
0/0	Oh yeah. Going out to get mine for sure! Not
0/0	Oh, hell no I‚Äôm not getting this vaccine
1/-1	Oh, so did my grandma just choose to die on her own cuz she was bored then?!
1/1	Oh, so you‚Äôre a scientist now? Or just a doctor? The vaccine effort is international and peer reviewed! Think about that before spreading fear and mistrust on no base‚Ä¶
0/0	Oh, we'll know 10 years down the road when half of these people can't have kids. I sure as hell am avoiding that vaccine at all costs.
1/-1	Ohgawd...hurry! I am not going to survive this.... Hurry before I end up homeless
1/1	Ohhhhhh myyyyyyy cant wait for the vaccine,, MY HERO
1/1	Ohio needs vaccine. Not able to get an appointment.
0/-1	Oho it's really disgusting... I have friends in Arizona & 2 days back we had a very intense discuss on these killer vaccines. They all said will die but never take these satanic shots .. It's a bigging of mark of the beast 666
1/1	Ok I understand people being skeptical because the vaccine was kind of rushed but thinking that doctors are lying to you? That's beyond me
0/-1	Ok cool, you all get the vaccine so I don't have to :)
1/1	Ok great we are getting more vaccines and there working!!! WE WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL THIS SUMMER!!
1/1	Ok here goes. Have had both Covid shots and will continue to wear a mask. I‚Äôll also get my flu shot in Oct. and continue wearing a mask during flu season. Come at me. #Vaccinate
0/0	Ok if I`m supposed to trust anything you say, that video did not help you at all. I refuse the vaccination due to this video. It looks dangerous and I`m not wanting to die today. Dr`s already killed me twice with a needle, I`m not going to let you do it a 3rd time
0/-1	Ok let‚Äôs discuss effect of vaccination!Is a person getting vaccinated become proof of not getting corona ! Does vaccine ensure that a person infected with corona will not spread corona ? Vaccine can only save his own life, nothing else!Whereas we are talking rallies as spreader
1/1	Ok so I'm now totally sick of all this covid shit.. In And out of lockdown not seeing anyone or doing anything.. fuck it I'll be happy to take a jab.. get life moving again.. and the gyms open!.
0/0/0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it
0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it üëåüèΩ
1/1	Ok the vaccine is in needed
1/1	Ok vaccine is good to everyone. so go on qnd good luck!
0/0/0/0	Ok what happens if you take the vaccine and then you have an adverse reaction to it or even worse die. Who is liable? Answer: you are!
1/0	Ok you take the vaccine- but still have to wear a mask- how can a virus be out- and create a vaccine less then a year of virus- how's that possible- when you don't a vaccine for other infections- all this less then a year
0/-1	Ok, what is the long term after effects?. Oh you don‚Äôt know because it has not been tested for long enough. 5-10yrs not 5-10 months The regulators who approved this also have a lot to answer to and also must be held accountable if anything was to go wrong.
0/0	Okay I'm not an antivaxxer or conspiracy theorist, but Johnson and Johnson? I learned not to trust their tear free shampoo, and I'm not making the same mistake again
0/0	Okay so you differentiate other pre-conditions from vaccine deaths, now do the numbers on fatalities due DIRECTLY from covid & get back to me
1/1	Okay then. I‚Äôll take AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna. By taking all three I‚Äôll surely won‚Äôt get infected.
1/1/1/1	Okay, I'll have an immunity while y'all fucks are dying around me.
0/0	Okay...there‚Äôs a 99.9% recovery rate but your promoting an EXPERIMENTAL vaccine with ‚Äúperhaps‚Äù a 95% success rate that we have NO IDEA of its long term side effects?!?! I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm going to trust the immune system that God created and not sinful man that creates a concoction of toxic ingredients that is known to change our DNA. Warning: you are worshiping the created rather than the Creator!
0/0	Old people die soon , young people die anytime. Im old so I will let God and mother nature take me when its my time, and not by a needle. GL.
1/1	Older members of my family have started getting their Covid vaccines, and it makes me so happy.
0	Omg running out of shots Jesus Christ let me book an appointment for my entire family as soon as humanly possible.... yeah right üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1/1	On Sunday I received the first dose of your Covid 19 vaccine, and I just want to thank your hardworking clever scientists and all those involved, including the Guinea Pigs who between them got that vaccine into my arm
1/1	On Wednesdays we get vaccinated
1/1	On astrzaneca for a week. Partying hard with no aise effects at all.
0/0	On our own without the vaccine we have a 99% recovery rate...WTF
0/0	On the backs murdered babies for a cold virus with a 99% survival rate.
0/0	On the basis of the adverse events reporting system data (which, I know, don't establish causality), the Covid vaccines are much less safe than other vaccines, and vastly less safe than ivermectin, which itself vastly lowers the risks from Covid.
1/-1	On the day the WHO officially declares this thing as downgraded to endemic, we should mark it as a global holiday.
0/-1	On the one hand our far-right extremists (the sad brexiteers) say the old-fashioned nation state which has caused so many wars in Europe, should be king again. The brexiteers argue that Europen states shouldn't join together to share expertise and co-operate, and shouldn't therefore be building the beneficial new world of the EU. That's what they say over and over again, yet, now, all of a sudden the condemn Germany for coming to its own independent scientific judgement. People would be forgiven for thinkig this smacks of 'euro-hate', pure and simple.
1/-1/1	On what age group? It's very clear that if you take the population as a whole, the benefits of AstraZeneca outweights the risks, as the virus is really deadly for old and at-risk patients. No one but anti-vaxxers can doubt that.
1/1	Once I get vaccinated I need to go on tour and see all my friends ü•∫ Vegas Colorado and Houston me pls
1/1	Once I'm 18 I'm getting caught up on all my vaccines
1/1	Once a vaccine is available at my hospital in canada in several weeks im taking it.
1/1	Once again, the Vox team has outdone themselves on the editing process! It looks super well-made! Thank you for the informative video!
0/0	Once all of humanity is vaccinated for the covit19 and is sickened and dying then the international health community would have accomplished there goal of depopulation so the earth can be saved for them
1/1	Once developed, the mRNA technology could be used for many more viruses.
1/1	Once it becomes available to people like me (not a frontline worker, not in a high-risk demographic, so therefore probably a bit down the queue), yes I will.
1/1	Once my family and I all receive our approved vaccinations, I could care less if other people decide not to vaccinate themselves and are still at risk of being sick because of their decision.
0/0	Once someone said "How dare you question it... you antivaxer" was the moment I decided to pass.
0/0	Once the fear and paranoia has left them I would consider taking it, I dont make decisions based on fear, group mentality and economic pressure tactics, I'm not an animal I'm a human being
1/1	Once there is a vaccine, it is much easier to reach herd immunity and stop the spread
0/0	Once there is some honesty and transparency in the reporting of side effects and associated deaths. "Switzerland declines to authorise AstraZeneca vaccine"
1/1	Once there was no vaccine, people complained about how the government not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. Then we heard the vaccine was coming, then people started complaining about how it's taking too long. Then the vaccine reach and dissemination started, then people started complaining about the nurses not wearing any gloves. Some of you people are real jokers who will complain and disagree about whether the sky is blue and water is in the sea.
1/-1	Once upon a time, people had to present a thorough vaccination card to enter USA.
0/-1	Once you get past covid, you get a free 6 month immunity! Yay!
0/-1	Once you have had Covid, your body has the antibodies. It does not make sense to take a vaccine that is supposed to have your body create the antibodies.
0/0	Once you realise that the "pandemic" was for the vaccine and not the other way round. Things become a lot clearer.
0/0	One DOZEN scientifically proven methods to treat, prevent and CURE COVID-19. All scientific information is included, as is official documentation from the CDC, WHO, NIH and others. Nobody debunks or refutes, this is all absolutely proven. The vaccines are KILLING PEOPLE!! My blog proves it!! PAY ATTENTION FOLKS!! BEWARE!! BEWARE!! Your politicians are evil terrorists: https://sites.google.com/view/thewalk3/how-to-cure-covid-19-quickly-easily-inexpensively
1/1	One case out of millions. I'm totally willing to take those odds to be protected even somewhat from COVID-19. Maybe view the video one more time and try to pay attention. It was a very clear, fair and objective explanation. Just because so far there is no final conclusion is no reason to go flying off into panic.
1/-1	One celebrity speaks out for COVID-19 vaccine.
0/0	One day in the future, i sincerely hope we don't look back & wonder if we have been doing widescale medical experimentation a la Mengele, on the general public, instead of vaccinating them.
0	One death from covid is too much but disability or deaths from a vaccine is OK welcome to the double think new abnormal ' slaves
0/0	One death from covid is too much but disability or deaths from a vaccine is OK welcome to the double think new abnormal ' slaves '
1/1	One dose and less side effects. My vote is that we start fast tracking this into the vaccine we give kids. If parents and teachers get the double dose vaccines and kids get this one at least If schools are vectors they won‚Äôt transmit it far and the kids are already unlikely to get severely ill.
0/0	One dose is not enough! Come back for round 2, No Thanks
0/0	One huge side effect is DEATH!
0/0	One lab rat asked the other if he had the vaccine yet and he replied that it`s still in human trials.
1/1	One more thing. Take whatever vaccine is available. You're better off with an 80% effective vaccine today then a 95% effective vaccine in 3 months. We don't know what the efficacy of the J&J vaccine will be -but if it gains an EUA but is <95% effective - people should still get it right away and avoid waiting!
0/0	One mouse says to the other mouse, "hey, have you tried that new COVID vaccine?". The other mouse replies, "are you crazy, it hasn't even been tested on humans yet".
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	One must wonder why the makers of the vaccine have been given immunity to any liability for it.
0/0	One of my customers who's an ER nurse said people are coming in in droves all day every day with vaccine complications. Don't hear about that on the news!
1/1	One of the benefits of being 65 is that I‚Äôm eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. I got my first dose this week, and I feel great. Thank you to all of the scientists, trial participants, regulators, and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point.
0/0/0	One of the dad's at my son's school died unexpectedly this week. No-one knows of what (but he was Cov negative) He was also vaxxed last week and people won't contemplate any possible link This is a very sad day indeed
1/1	One of the great things about these vaccines is that they can be used in a wide variety of individuals
0/-1	One of the lousiest covid vaccination...
0/0	One of the main reasons I am saying #NoVaccineForMe is that the government has lied to us too many times about Covid numbers, reasons for infections, and the Covid vaccine itself. I cannot in my right mind take what they say seriously. THIS IS MY LIFE!
0/0	One of the medical profession's greatest boasts is that it eradicated smallpox through the use of the smallpox vaccine. I myself believed this claim for many years. But it simply isn't true!
1/1	One of the most massive side effects of the vaccine is - you won‚Äôt catch the virus! Da da!
1/0	One of the reasons the vaccine came out so fast was because the ENTIRE WORLD was working on it. I don't get that argument against it. I still wouldn't take it just yet if I didn't have to, but what is that "it came out too fast" excuse?
0/0	One of the side effect is death. Why governments and manufacturer don't inform us about that?
1/1	One of the side effects is that in 6 months we get to live a normal life! People grow a pair and vaccinate!
1/1	One of the worlds most valuable commodities‚Äù.... it‚Äôs a life saving vaccine. the value is on the LIVES SAVED. profiting off of health care is demonic.
1/1	One out of every 1.8 million who got the J&J died. What are you odds of dying in a car accident? Drowning? Getting hit by lightning? WTF is everyone so freaking scared??
1/0	One person dies from a vaccine- It's poison, don't take it! 400000 people die from a virus- Did you hear about the guy who died from the vaccine?? Scary!!
0/0	One person dying from the vaccine, JUST ONE is enough. I will not become a lab rat for big pharma.
1/1	One question only - when is it my turn?
1/1	One shot in the arm and you‚Äôre done and you‚Äôre saving lives, man up
1	One should get vaccinated to protect yourself and others around you.
0/0	One side effect of the vaccine that seems to be cropping up recently is known as ‚ÄúCOVID Arm‚Äù
1/1	One step closer to getting back to reality by corona vaccine!
1/1	One thing I know for sure, Covid-19 is not safe. My 88 year old mother had her second dose of Pfizer a few days ago. Absolutely no side effects. The vaccines being used in the US have been tested on 30‚Äì40K people. That‚Äôs good enough for me.
1/1	One thing I noticed about people who complain about the covid vaccine is that they have questions that can easily be answered but they don't look it up
1/1	One thing I try to keep in mind is for every reported ‚Äòbad‚Äô side effects (beyond fatigue and sore arms) how many people are being vaxxed with no side effects which seem to FAR outnumber those that do.
0/0	One thing about me I ain‚Äôt gonna take that until I see the after effects and what it do to other people
0/0	One thing to not forget. once the vaccine is in. there is no way out.
1/1	One third of Israel is vaccinated and now the country is seeing covid slowed the fuck down. Data shows that the vaccine works just 31 ppl in 165,000 tracked tested positive after vaccination.
0/0	One vaccine for China-mutant another vaccine for British-mutant, Yet another vaccine for other mutant. What are short term and long term side effects of these vaccines.
0/0	One virus kill it with 75 different poisons and also use Nano particles Yeah c,mon man wake up
1/1	One week ago today I received my first Covid19 vaccination, it was the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and I am happy to report I‚Äôve had no problems or side-effects so far. Now await a call for the 2nd dose.

0/0	One word: "NEVER"
0/0	One would think they'd cover "what are the side effects?"
0/0/0/0	One's personal health should be one personal choice. Period!!!
1/0	Only 27% globally don't agree to be vaccinated?? That's sad and discouraging.

0/0	Only Jesus Christ can Save you from this Wretched World
0	Only a complete uneducated moron would take any of these vaccines...have people not even bothered to look up agenda 21 and agenda 30...just plain stupidity it really is.
1/-1	Only a fool follows his own thoughts when he doesn't have any serious training in a field.
1/1	Only after vaccinating our adult population we will be mentally free to work without risk of being affected and businesses can prosper,corporate world should think of it as investment rather than a cost
0/0	Only boomers trust these people.
0/0	Only healthy people were allowed to participate in these vaccine trials. There are NO trials on people with health issues at all, which is super stupid since these vaccines will only work well on the Healthy Health Care workers, not the ones the vaccine is suppose to be for.
0/0	Only if it gets rid of masks and social distancing. So no for now.
1/0/0	Only if you are out of your mind to take any of these vaccines.
1/1/1/1/1	Only in America would people protest your getting a vaccine that would save your life.
0/0	Only it's not a vaccine. It's a highly experimental biological agent that the only immunity it confers is immunity from prosecution.
1/0	Only morons believe ALL vaccines or any other medications are safe, hell peanut butter is deadly to some. Look at the HPV vaccine track record and they have spent years on it and still haven't gotten it right. This is propaganda.
0/0	Only one woman has died so far they say.....well, that is one too many. Dangerous blood clots, my goodness. It is safer to take your chances and just wear a mask than to take these poisonous vaccines.
0/0	Only retards would willingly inject poison into their bodies, FUCK THE VACCINE!
0/0	Only reviewed for a few months? Scary.
0/0	Only shot I'm taking has a bullet in the chamber....at least I know where I stand with God!
1/1	Only side effect...a sore arm...to be expected. Pfizer vaccine. A heavy sign of relief...the benefits far outweigh the consequences. I‚Äôll take that. Ready for the second dose.
0/-1	Only the Sheep take the China Twitch vaccine.
0/0	Only the gullible want this fake vaccine
0/0	Only the people who get the vaccine will have covid
0/0	Only time and accurate tracking will tell for sure; scientists have to look for unusual patterns of disease in groups of vaccinated people.
0/-1	Only time we do that is when we get rid of organisations like the WHO and governments who are leading the way in dividing the people!
0/-1	Only time will tell if the vaccine efficacy is still effective after 1-2 years.
0/-1	Only to 100 centers? That‚Äôs extremely sparse.
1/1	Only vaccines can save
0/0	Only way Id get this, is if it were forced on my body unwillingly. They shouldn't of planned this during election year to oust Trump, seeing's how it was a dead give away in timing. Makes one wonder how stupid they are, or they think we are? Funny thing is, I've deliberately tried to catch this thing, but cant. I feel better now, than I have in years.
1/1	Only way to end the pandemic: vaccinations.
1/1	Only way to get out of this mess is to get the vaccine

0	Oooo gene therapy and a biometric identification tag. Sounds great, where do I sign up?
1/-1	Oops, forgot to add, great video, it is always appreciated how to the point and clear you are in explaining the results!
1/1	Open more vaccine factories !!! Now !!! Make more vaccine. And quit debating whether you can postpone the 2nd dose. Just make more around the clock !!!
0/-1	Operative word synthetic. I pass
1/0	Opinion: If there are any paths at all by which a person can become extremely rich, something as hugely valuable + important as creating a covid vaccine should be one of them. If nobody at all gets extremely rich from this, that indicates a failure on the part of our society
0/0	Or just take Vitimin D3 and Zinc and eat fresh food and go and exercise and hug your friends and let your immune system do its job without a filthy rag around your mouth and nostrils
0/0	Or that it isn't a vaccine in any form but a gene therapy.
1/1	Or they attempt to go on an aeroplane and discover the airline, or other country, won't let them enter without vaccination.
1/1	Order aside, I just wish they'd accelerate things. On a per capita basis we're roughly 30th of 50 states. Embarrassing, and unacceptable.
1/0	Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0/0	Other than causing some deaths, look what happens to Brant Griner's mother (Pfizer) who's now getting severe convulsion and Shawn Skelton (Moderna) who got adverse neurological orders after vaccinated. Any vaccine that is and about to come out is questionable and rushed, they're all trying to be Superman saving the day and raking money at the same time.

1/-1	Our first good news of the year... Is not exactly good news. Damn you reality

1/1	Out of 56M . Don‚Äôt check what your odds are to be struck by lightning or have a condom fail or fall down an open mine. They are all higher than the potential to get Covid after your vaccinated . Just putting things in perspective! #GetVaccinated https://t.co/qqfnbgKtOQ

0/0	Pandemic or not, I'm not taking THEIR vaccine
0/-1/0	Pandemic= panic=media
0/0/-1	Pandemics can overwhelm health systems leading to drug stock outs and overstretched health workers. COVID-19 is disrupting access to testing and treatment and could lead to tens of thousands more lives being lost to malaria, especially in Africa. We can‚Äôt let this happen.

1/1/1/1	Peddling anti-vaxx lies should be a crime.
0/0	People SHOULD have a decision in their own health. Because vaccines are PRODUCTS, and products can be faulty, contaminated, falsely advertised, or otherwise useless. Forcing people to take an experimental, rushed, medical intervention is dangerous. Period.
0/0	People actually think the shots work? LOL. Clearly they don't realize Polio was almost gone when the shot came out.
1/0	People after knowing vaccine sides: I fear nothing! But this thing, the vaccine. It scares me!
0/-1	People are asking wrong questions... Its not even a question that covid-19 is real or not the question is what are the hidden motives

0/0	People are getting very ill and even dying from these "vaccines" People need to wake up!
0/0	People are going to be dying and suffering from the side effects of this new tech that's barely been tested and rushed out for years
1/1	People are horrible at risk analysis, though. The benefits of vaccination, in all cases, vastly outweigh any imagined risks. Refusing vaccination, especially in the case of covid, is frankly lunacy.
1/1	People are just idiots if they dont take the shot
0/0	People are literally just giving in to it wtf I'm not taking this bs
0/0/0/0	People are posting their vaccs experiences, all happy about getting fever, chills body aches and saying "Oh, yay! Its working!"

Not to mention they can't reflect back on a year and realise they've been perfectly fine yet go and willingly get injected with a vaccs that is considered 'in clinical trials until 2023'. The absurdity is astounding.

1/-1	People dying of a pandemic. "There's no evidence of a pandemic".
0/0	People genuinely appear to believe that the COVID-19 vaccines have undergone clinical trials and have been proven to be both safe and effective. That belief is simply wrong.

1/1	People have the freedom to say no to the vaccine, but everyone‚Äôs obligation to public health should be higher. If we don‚Äôt reach herd immunity, this pandemic will never end.
1/1/1/-1	People in poor countries line up for Vaccines and they force their governments to get more if they run out of them meanwhile people with all the choice in the world are choosing the wrong option.

1/-1	People obey authority a lot which is terrifying or good depending on the situation.
1/1	People often forget that there are potential adverse reactions in ALL treatments (medications, vaccines, procedures, ect.). Unfortunately, it's often random. You just have to weight the risk vs benefit.

1/0	People should also keep in mind of the fact that the strain of coronavirus has already been known for many decades
1	People shouldn't have to die due to others ignorance. Antivaxxers should be exempt from any public welfare. Which in most european countries include school, college, medical, rent subsidizes, etc. They should also be exempt from public places like park, state pools, state kindergartens/pre-school. Hell, make a patch they have to wear so the rest of us can avoid them. Let they have their little anti-vax communities they can mingle in.

1/1	People who are outraged at a relatively few bad reactions to the Covid vaccines, are brain dead about the number of gun deaths every day. We need to quit talking about "Fauci Fatigue" and talk about "Mass Shooting Fatigue".
0/0	People who aren't sick, are lining up & waiting to get a shot, (#vaccine) that anecdotal evidence & studies have shown will make them sick, all to "protect" themselves from getting sick! Got it!
1/1	People who decline the offer of a vaccine are a serious issue, and more needs to be done to counter the anti-vaxxer propaganda that leads to these myths and "concerns"
1/1	People who don't take vaccines should not be allowed to fly and their passports should be canceled.
1/-1	People who don't trust the vaccine are, in my opinion, very likely not to trust these things.
1/1	People who don't want the vaccine just leave more for the rest of us. If they want to catch a virus we know nothing about, with unknown long term effects vs. trusting medical science we've come to understand over more than 200 years of inoculating against viruses that's on them.

0/0	People who haven't been sick all year are willing to get sick from a shot to feel protected from something that hasn't made them sick all year???
0/1	People who hear these claims may be worried about health effects, being tracked wherever they go, or even faith-related problems.
1/1	People who obsess about covid vaccine distribution not even in the medical field are weird losers in my book. My brother is actually in the medical field as a geneticist and last thing I texted him was ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù not ‚ÄúHey, are you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù

1/1/0	Perhaps I am an optimist as it is too early to tell - but there is something.. unusual happening with the hospitalization data. Cases continue to rise (and positivity rates in most places as well, so it's not just more testing) but hospitalizations have started to inflect.
0/0	Perhaps not, but some people have gotten dead, blood clots, severe life threatening rashes, etc., and we don't even know the long-term side effects yet.
0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers
0/0/0/0/0/1/0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1/1	Perhaps you should ask if DM is a credible news source before using it as a decision maker. Most health care professionals I know, including myself are getting the vaccine.
0/0	Personal choice - I'll not be taking it
0/0	Personally I don't trust the current government, how about it be tested on them before the essential worker's prioritized
0/0	Personally I feel that government overreach is worse than a public health failure which results in a 1.6% case fatality rate virus killing people who unfortunately would easily have died without being infected or did die slightly after being infected. I mean cmon we‚Äôve fucked our economy and our government can‚Äôt be trusted to give us sufficient stimulus for isolation, either let us work or provide the stimulus.
0/1	Personally I would be pretty happy to take a vaccine when one is available, I just recognise that it is some time away.
1/1	Personally I‚Äôve been hanging out for the Novovax vaccine, and would take it tomorrow if it was available. I‚Äôve been reading lots of reports, and it seems they‚Äôve been taking the most cautious approach of all the pharma companies, and indications are they have far fewer side effects than any other.
0/1	Personally i would rather get covid then the vaccine. On the other hand i do want everyone else to get the vaccine so i can take my mask off.
1/1	Personally will be amongst the first citizens to be vaccinated once the vaccine is available in Namibia as an Educator.
1/1	Personally, I am in favor and have an appt to get mine in February... but I also believe it‚Äôs a choice. That said, if you don‚Äôt want to be part of the solution then you are part of the problem. I don‚Äôt want to live in a bubble the rest of my life so I‚Äôm doing something about it.
0/0	Personally, I don't feel compelled to take vaccines for things I'm not at risk for.
1/1	Personally, I just wish people could read on, get better at interpreting statistics, fact-checking and not be so damn cross-confident in their positions and perceptions so we can all take the vaccine and put an end to this pandemic.
0/0	Personally, I won‚Äôt be having it yet. In my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.
0/1	Personally, I won‚Äôt be having it yet.I am not an antivaxxer but, in my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.Vaccines normally go through a minimum 5 year trial, to check for long term affects. This one hasn‚Äôt.
1/1/1	Perspective: So far 7,000,000 Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine shots given. 6 blood clots. 1 death, 1 critical. 6,999,994 just fine.
0/0	Pfffftttt!! That‚Äôs what I think of the vaccine
0/0/1/0/0/0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0/0	Pfiezer are not taking responsibility for reactions from this vaccine why would you take something that won‚Äôt take responsibility for the side affects
0/0	Pfizer CEO sounds exactly the way Joseph Goebbels helping to build German Nazi Third Reich. Thousands out side are repeating what he says now and believe it's absolute Truth.
0/-1	Pfizer CEO still hasn't taken the shot himself. That's highly suspicious. That's like the Nike CEO refusing to wear Nike's.
0/0	Pfizer CEO won't take the vaccine. That should tell you how safe it is!
1/1	Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are extremely safe, with some mild expected side effects, UK regulator finds
1/1	Pfizer and Moderna have published their clinical trials results. For the Pfizer vaccine, over 40k people were tested and it was found safe. Unless you have an uncommon medical condition or taking an uncommon medication, you are likely safe taking the vaccine.
0/0	Pfizer and Moderna injections are not vaccines. They are injecting people with synthetic gene therapy. The injections will not prevent you from gett
0/0	Pfizer and Moderna only utilized 4% Asians during test trials but it doesn‚Äôt indicate specifically which Asian ethnicity participated in clinical trial as Asian is quite diverse from Filipino, Polynesian, korean, Chinese, Japanese, Laos, Thai, Vietnamese and Cambodian etc...all our physiology and DNA are different and unique so we react differently. They didn‚Äôt test enough
0/0	Pfizer and madorna have immunity to being prosecuted for what they put in that vaccine. So you can't sue them if you're completely crippled after it.
0/0	Pfizer cvaccine is dangerous and more deadly
1/1/0/-1	Pfizer expects to make $15 billion in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine. That will make it the second highest revenue of any drug, anytime, anywhere
1/1	Pfizer first shot baby! Getting my second this weekend. No effects besides getting a little tired.
0/0	Pfizer had countless of court cases where they lost. I m not taking their vaccine
0/0	Pfizer has a history of falsifying data how can anyone trust them after that.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Pfizer has included a no liability clause to their manufacture and distribution. Anything that goes wrong regards side effects..or long term effects which no one knows ..about as it has been rushed through..theres no liability no responsubility.the risk is yours..
1/-1	Pfizer has least amount of Side Effects..
0/-1	Pfizer have been fined about $5000000000 (yes 5 billion dollars) for the side effects of previous vaccines, that might have something to do with the public's hesitation tbf.
1/1	Pfizer here. Sore arm from both shots, cold sweats after shot 1.
0/0	Pfizer investigated ‚Äú itself ‚Äúand found ‚Äúitself‚Äù not guilty
0/0	Pfizer is testing on children, fuck the shot

1/1	Pfizer is the best. Hope the world will recover soon.
1/1/1	Pfizer made it!
1/1	Pfizer or bust for me. 95% efficacy puts me at ease
0/0	Pfizer says if you take the vaccine you can die and if you don't take it you may die
1/1	Pfizer seems like one of the best and safest vaccines
0/-1	Pfizer study ends 2023, Moderna end of 2022.
0/0	Pfizer vaccine potentially is the cause of multiple deaths. Why do they release vaccines without proper testing results?
0/0	Pfizer wants to make instant bucks by intimidating healthy ones of the world having no self confidence .
1/1	Pfizer will make the first covid 19 medicines
1/1	Pfizer would be winning if this was a competition imo. Take whatever vaccine you can get for sure, every one is important. It's just impressive Pfizer-biontech has had the earliest trial, best efficacy and least side effects so far, all while over-delivering on their promises
1/1	Pfizer. 1st- sore arm for 2 days, headache. 2nd- sore arm for 1 day, headache, joint pain, night sweats, tiredness, all gone in under 36 hours. I also had covid in December and the side effects are nothing compared to that. I was exhausted for a week, headaches for a month, a cough that I still occasionally have.
1/1	Pfizer/BioNTech deliver again, nice!
0/0	Phahk Fauci, Birx and all the t@ssers at the CDC and in Biden's charade. Oh, and his now new claim (after saying masks are not necessary) that wearing 2 or more masks is safer than wearing one.......YUCK FOU. Just wear the whole box already.
1/1	Pharma companies aren‚Äôt going to spend billions of dollars manufacturing a vaccine that‚Äôs still in testing and may not be approved. They would wait for approvals, in this case they started manufacturing at scale as soon as they were reasonable sure they had a safe and effective vaccine candidate.
0/0	Pharma funds the world lol thank you Robert Kennedy Jr for your work exposing vaccines
0/0	Pharma is designed to enrich the elite while bankrupting and killing us.
1/1	Pharmacy Tech here. I can't wait to hopefully get my vaccine next week and finally stop worrying about getting CoVid every day coming into work.
0/0	Phase 3 clinical trials should go on for YEARS and this doc knows that.
1/1	Phizer. Just sore arm
1/1	Phone call at 12ish from my GP practice today, can I be in for 9am tomorrow morning for my Astra Zeneca covid vaccine shot - they're phoning patients ahead of us receiving our letters and working round the clock to vaccinate us. Yep, 4 sure, i'll be there.
0/0	Physicians aren't always correct. I am the best arbiter of my health. My immune system is functioning just fine.
0/-1	Pick your poison.
0/1	Pity they didnt make such a fuss about all the treatments that have been available months and months back. Perhaps a lot more fellow humans would still be alive.
1/1	PlEASE Give the vaccines faster!...
0/0	Plain and simple The Covid vaccine is designed to genetically modify your cells which is irreversible that gives the government control over your body. LOL. Covid deaths are not on the rise. They don't report vaccine deaths but rather they report them as covid deaths something to think about
1/1	Plan to get vaccinated in a month or two just to fight off the new strain
0/1	Plandemic = means of manipulation Vaccine = means of depopulation Cheers!
1/1	Pleae people, do the only right thing, take the vaccine!

1/1	Please accept the vaccine. The gains are worth feeling a bit unwell. Keeping yourself and others safe, helping getting us all back with those we love and in honour of those we have lost. The vaccination teams are brilliant too!
0/0	Please all take your zombie vaccin! Vaccin helps for maximum of 2-6 months.
1/1	Please also provide vaccines to under developed countries in time
0/0	Please be careful folks. If the vaccines which have existed for decades are still harming people, what about new 'approved' vaccines which have not seen the light of day!
1/1	Please be smart, Bart. Covid can kill, Phil. Science is real, Neal. Get your vaccine, Maxine.
1/1	Please believe in the scientists people
0/0	Please brother don't take the vaccine, it's the government trying to brainwash you, you're half brainwashed don't be full
1/1	Please can we keep this sensible and accurately informed. Used correctly vaccination is probably the greatest benefit modern preventive medicine has to offer. Other equivalent issues are largely economic, educational, environmental, political or behavioural.
0	Please consider not taking the vaccine !!!! Improve health diet exercise nutrition !!
1/1	Please correct me if I'm wrong but, when you have an R of 2.5, you would only need 60% of the people vaccinated/immune to get it down to R=1 right? So we don't need 100% vaccination to get the R below 1. Anyone knows what the R-value of Covid-19 is without any social distancing?
1/1	Please do deliver all required doses immediately to Canada. We want our loved ones protected Please
1/1	Please do vaccinate. The current goal is to, thru vaccination, reduce the amt. of folks needing hospitalization and worse, death. The vaccines will at the very least, make everyone's symptoms far milder. Gets us closer to herd immunity also the more we vaccinate.
1/1	Please don't leave old or incomplete information online when it comes to this. There's already a crisis of disinformation around it out there. Lets all do our part to end this pandemic.
0/-1	Please don't take a vaccine that has not been proven safe.
0/0	Please don't take the covid vaccine because this "Mark of the Beast".Vaccine patent number 060606. Read the Bible is Revelation 13:16.

0/0	Please dont vaccinate i dont want my kids to have corona
0/0	Please don‚Äôt get the Vaccine it is not safe will change your D&A and may kill you also could be the mark of the beast.
1/1	Please don‚Äôt go down the rabbit hole here. The more evidence that presents itself, the more it seems that reinfection is highly unlikely. With a vaccine widely distributed we will find ourselves in a spot were life will be normal again. This is not going to be an every 3 month occurrence. Again, the data shows that reinfection is incredibly rare. For once in 2020 lets bask i some good news
0/0	Please everyone dont take the covid vaccin it can be the mark of the beast

1/1	Please hurry up and vaccinate the clinically extremely vulnerable my husband comes in this group but has got to go work so we‚Äôre very worried
1/1	Please hurry with the vaccine . Covid is on the rise in PNG. Australia might step in to help the neighbouring Independent states in fighting the virus because of the high rate of poverty and increasing number of beggars and thieves on the streets.
1/1	Please if you dont want the vaccine you will not travel go to theatres concerts etc. We 'stupid' love the vaccine. There will be more for us!
0/0	Please listen, for those thinking the vaccine is THE solution, think again....
0/0	Please listen; Influenza doesn't exist and neither does tramissable SARS-COV-1 or 2, neither have been isolated by-the-way. What does exist is our natural ability to remove toxins from our bodies, they accumulate over months and when the seasons change or if a person suddenly starts to stay indoors out of sunlight the immune system responds and begins to produce various forms of viral matter, this matter dissolves waste material such as dead/dying cells and toxins we have ingested/absorbed over time, these dissolved substances are then absorbed into the blood and then bind to white blood cells so the larger mass can be captured and excreted from the body and this process requires energy and produces heat so we feel a fever and discomfort. If in this state you allow them to analyse your sputum/mucus and blood they will find protein markers pertaining to the viral matter you are producing. They lie when they say we transmit these viruses, they are non-living and are inert when outside of the body, if inhaled our own viral matter identifies it as foreign and dissolves itself and the waste matter it was bonded to. The whole feeling of having "the flu" is your body doing what it is supposed to do and you are supposed to ride it out and supplement your immune system with vitamins C, D & E, by tablets or by eating fruit and veg and go outside in the sunlight even if it is overcast. IGNORANCE = CONFUSION = FEAR = SUBMISSION = CONTROL‚Ä¶
0/0	Please look up ‚ÄúPfizer criminal history‚Äù and see what comes up. Simple. As. That.
0/0/0	Please note that the SAME should apply to bill gate's vaccine!! Any vaccine takes 10 to 12 years to develop! This stuff is not SAFE!
0/0	Please people - this is insane. They contradict themselves every day. They don't know what they're doing. DON'T get vaccinated until we have the full picture.
1/1	Please people, be greatful that the world works togheter in order to fight this virus. Be responsible and take the vaccine.
1/1	Please produce and send VACCINE to all countries, we are waiting!!!
1/1	Please put the vaccineine in the drug store. Ex: me I do not has no body to take me far away from my house for the vacinne but I live close to the drug store. I can walk there. Please
0/0	Please read up on any vaccines you going to take in your body, especially if it has not been tested, because it not the vaccine you think it is, it will make you pass out, LOSS of skin, blood clots, and not yourself ?
0/-1	Please read vaccine ingredients BEFORE getting the injection(s).
1/1	Please remember the Astra Zeneca Vaccination does give you some protection against other Covid strains besides the South African variant so don‚Äôt be discouraged if like me you have just had it. It can still save your life. Yes we may need a top up, this is true of other strains!
1/1	Please share some of your privilege with poor and developing nations. If the whole world is not saved by vaccinations, more mutations will follow that will be resistant to the vaccinations that are being used now.
0/0/0	Please stop calling things conspiracy theories when the person who was a pioneer in creating vaccines and pushing them on to people has admitted himself that there is a tonne of conflict of interest and corruption behind the science of vaccines
1/-1	Please stop spreading vaccine disinformation.
0/1	Please stop this. You conveniently fail to point out NONE of the MORE than 2,000 patients in this study died or was hospitalized. THIS matters. The purpose of vaccination is to bring the severity down to the level of a benign virus. That‚Äôs how this works. Report it correctly.
1/1	Please take it for gods sake
1/0	Please tell this to the Argentinian government! Very few vaccines and hardly any testing at all. Cases have dramatically risen and our health system is about to collapse. May God help Argentina.

0/0	Plenty of treatments available. No reason to destroy your health with injections.
0/0	Plenty of vaccinations don't provide immunity ;only a false sense of safety.....Most people with ACQUIRED immunity are better at not getting the disease again.
0/0	Plot twist... Imagine if everyone who received this " vaccination" died from COVID!?.
1/1	Plot twist: Coronavirus was created to get rid of Antivaxers

0/0/0/0	Pls. I‚Äôm begging. Tell me why I should take a vaccine for something that I can still spread and still get. What does this do for me if it does not stop the problem? Would really appreciate the input
1/1	Poeple doubt the vaccine but yet still want the Olympics to go on?

0/0	Polio was gone for years before vaccine came out and also there is a dozen countries with polio outbreaks because of Gates vaccine lol
1	Polio, measles, whooping cough, tetanus, Hep B, mumps.. Diseases that used to be prevalent.. Almost like they got eradicated the something???
0/0	Politician and the scientist should of taken the vaccine publicly first. Using our healthcare workers as guinea pigs is just weak.
0/0	Politicians making laws to protect Billionaire Pharmaceutical companies, instead of We the People.
0/0	Polyethylene Glycol (PG) is my issue with the vaccines. The petroleum based chemical was called dangerous and deadly when the vaping industry took off and it was nearly banned in 16'. Now suddenly it's considered safe. After seeing a relative panic over classic cancer symptoms, undergo multiple tests at a hospital over months only to find out it was PG side effects I will pass. 3 years later the symptoms still persist to this day. The Dr says they may persist for life. Topical, ingested and vape use has known side effects, but this vaccine is the first use of intravenous PG on humans. In animal tests, it caused cancer. In cows it caused reproductive harm and ovarian cancer. Coincidentally, the people that died from the covid vaccine so far, had the exact same side effects as those listed by the FDA for PG, namely anaphylactic shock. No thanks, no way, not now, not ever
0/0	Poor family, these senseless deaths are likely going to keep adding up due to these experimental, unproven vaccines

1/1/1	Portugal here, locked down since the 15th of January and currently leaving an extended 2nd wave, hopefully vaccinations prevent another one!
1/1	Possibly 1 died in a million plus doses given. If you get in your car & drive, there is 1 in 600,000 chance you will die. If you go to a doctor & receive antibiotic, there is a 1 in 200,000 chance you will die ..and on & on. Media is doing there best for humans to live like moles
1/1	Possibly having two different vaccines will give better protection against more of the current and future variant strains.

1/1	Praying the Moderna vaccine doses my wife finished 6 weeks ago does it's magic - a student in her 1st grade class has Covid.
1/1	Pre existing conditions definitely have an effect on the chances of you dying of COVID and its not just exclusively attributed to that. on the death certificate it is listed as a contributing factor. But saying that its okay to not get the vaccine and walk around a mask because ‚Äúonly a few old people will die‚Äù is selfish
0/0	Prediction: all "vaccine" induced deaths will be added to the Covid death tally.
0/0	Pregnant women should not take any Vaccine. There is reported many complications and deaths after birth. Someone should be looking into this immediately.

1/-1	Pretty big talk form someone who could be taken out by a rusty nail
1/1	Pretty hyped to get mine soon as a high schooler. Also all our teachers in our school district are vaccinated. Our school district finally started a hybrid school schedule but apparently 2/3rds of students preferred to stay home. 3 months left of school with 2 days that is hour one long at school. Also my school is letting free Covid testing so that‚Äôs great.

1/1	Pro-vaccine gang here.
0/0	Pro-vaccine propaganda ... that's the impression. I'm not anti-vaccine, per se. But, I remain unconvinced coronavirus vaccine is 1. Safe 2. Effective. Science has struggled, for decades to produce an effective vaccine aimed at coronavirus. The science has not changed. Coronavirus mutates and this version of coronavirus is no different. There are already cases of people re-infected with coronavirus after suffering the illness, during this pandemic. The vaccine experience will be no different. The FDA is fast tracking its' usual safety protocols. I will not be a member of this mass experiment with vaccination. Microchipping aside, Bill Gates, has a commercial interest in the vaccine, and he can't even keep viruses out of microsoft - he has no credible credentials to lecture humanity about the virus, or the vaccinations.
1/1	Pro-vaccine: Intelligence
0/0	Probably not for a while for my own reasons

0/0	Problem in india, even govt assure you for death compensation over vaccine side effects related death, but fake inquiry will prove it, normal death.

0/0	Psuedo science "logic": No one dies from the vaccine because we attribute all deaths to Covid.
1/1	Public health is an economic issue. The cost of a vaccine is a miniscule fraction of the cost of shutting down the economy so any government should be willing to spend perhaps a few hundred million in order to save themselves a few hundred thousand-million.
0/0	Public need the truth...I still say NO. I trust my immunity and actually the misrepresentations are the very ones we are being bombarded with daily!! Fake news is what I see daily from BBC to the rest. If it wasn't fake why did they not show all the turnout in cities against the jabs?? Why do they not let us know of the people in UK as well as the globe that got severe side effects inc death?? No body died of Influenza as of 23rd March 2020 to date!!! Now that's a coincidence or am I a conspiracy theorist???

0/1	Quackery has no place in a modern world
0/0	Question though, even with SARS and MERS research how does that help the situation? SARS, MERS, and the common cold are all in the corona virus family with COVID and yet even with all they research they have, scientists have been unable to create a reliable vaccine for SARS, MERS, or colds. How am I supposed to trust that COVID is any different?
1/1	Question! I had bad side effect to the astra vaccine (or maybe good immunity response) 10 hours after first dose , chills then high fever and muscle aches, BUT two days later I feel extremely well and I mean a feeling of being extremely healthy, even my skin is glowing, maybe its psychosomatic but I'm wondering if others are feeling this.
0/0/0	Question..... Many Americans are running out to get the bogus Corona Vaccine, so when the next bio weapon is released will those same people be getting the next experiment vaccine too??
0/-1	Question...how the covic 19 create and who create this???
0/0	Questions we are not supposed to ask 1 - Why are people still required to wear masks even after vaccination? 2 - Why are companies requiring that countries who buy the vaccines cannot take legal actions following the purchase? If your products are truly safe why are you making that requirement?
1/1	Quick fact of the day: Vaccines prevent more than 2.5 million deaths each year.
1/0	Quick note for those who don‚Äôt think the virus is that bad. COVID-19 is definitely a dangerous disease though it varies from person to person. The effects of the virus can be different based on a multitude of factors and while it‚Äôs more dangerous among those who are immune compromised, it also affects people based on their genetics. I did unfortunately lose family..... my aunt was very healthy and still lost her life.... vaccines do indeed have fragments of the virus but it tells the body what to fight and how to fight it. My mother and father are both immune compromised. My father with an extensive heart condition and my mother grappling with dermatomyositis (a vicious and rare auto immune disorder.) Some of you out there say that taking a vaccine is a choice and while it is ultimately your choice, it‚Äôs for not only your safety but it‚Äôs for others as well! Now for those of you who are in open defiance of the vaccine and stop people from getting it, (Like the ignoramuses that forced the dodger stadium facility to shut down.) you need to stop! If you‚Äôre so damn adamant about choice in this matter then why aren‚Äôt you letting others make the decision for themselves! Stop doing this! It helps no one at all!
0/0	Quick quick everyone panic, Boris give me an injection. What a load of BS.
1/1	Quite informative. I had the 1st dose a little over a week ago. Felt great afterward, but then I felt intense tiredness and of course, as expected, pain at the site of vaccination. I did yoga that evening, then the next day I was back to my HIIT routines. The 2nd dose is what I‚Äôve heard could be a KO lol.

0/0/0/0	Same company that didn't say anything about their deadly powder ohhh that company no thanks lol
1/1	Same here! One down. Took 25 minutes total from time I drove in to time I left including 15 minute rest period. Feeling good.
1/1	Same in North Brooklyn/Greenpoint. Trying to find local, nearby available vaccine location for elderly parents
0/0	Same issue across the Nordic countries as well. I‚Äôm Canadian but my Finnish girlfriend was explaining this to me not long ago. Hearing that makes me hesitant to trust rushed vaccines...
0/0	Same issue with Johnson & Johnson vaccine now! Today 4-13-21 they halted the use of this vaccine due to six women developing a rare unusual blood clot. Of the 6 women one has died and one is in critical condition!
0/0	Same old,same old...all I hear is umm,umm. And they still have no clue that it will work.. go get ur shots , I'll wait a few more years and stick to my shot of tequila
0/-1	Same propaganda story every day for months. You guys are doing a bang up job
1/1	Same, allergic to Penicillin so I will ask if that would be an issue, if so another vaccine may be for me. this is one vaccine so hopefully another may be "safe" for those who are allergic.
1	Same. I get my second dose on Saturday, two weeks to the day I fly out to see my (vaccinated) father and I can‚Äôt wait! I‚Äôm also flying the day after my second shot with a group of (vaccinated) friends to the Touch Of Disney event and I can feel my life getting back to normal. I had a Jamba Juice with a friend at the mall during her lunch break the other day and ran into two old coworkers I hadn‚Äôt seen in over a year. It felt so good and normal. Making plans to go see Black Widow in the theater in July. I‚Äôve been safe but slowly living life again (I was in the ‚Äúwiping down my delivered groceries‚Äù camp at the very beginning) and have eaten out, gone on hikes, and generally been as safe as I can while still maintaining my mental health. Getting dumped during the pandemic didn‚Äôt help so I absolutely am going to live my life to the Max after I‚Äôm fully vaccinated.
0/0	Save the taxpayers dollars! Nobody wants it!
1/1	Save the world and trust the vaccine.
0/-1	Saved millions of lives? Seriously?

1/1	Second Pfizer shot yesterday. As advertised, not as easy as the first but glad it is done. The aches, pains and other side effects are worth it in my mind. Take your advice from medical professionals, not politicians. We all play a role. Happy to be a lab rat if it helps.

0/-1	Seeing this on the news makes me happy. Vaccines should never be mandatory
1/1	Seek medical advice and get vaccinated.
1/1	Seems good news - if you've had the Pfizer.
1/1	Seems like FDA wants to listen to the twitter trending hysteria crowd. Its decision to pause a much needed, safe vaccine. Let‚Äôs highlight the facts: Six cases out of 6 million plus doses administered is an indefinitely small quantity; a value approaching zero.
1/0	Seems like The doctor and nurse see the whores of covert 19 and out of fear they want everyone to take it but it doesn't validate if The vaccine works and if it's safe To me it's more out of desperation and fear
1/1	Seems like a lot of places are still limited by supply. Here's to hoping that the J&J plant gets approved and more doses from Moderna and Pfizer come along.
0/0	Seems like a perfect Recipe for "I am legend" disaster.

0/0	Seems like we have become like animals... one does it we all do..One animal moves they all do.

1/1/1	Seriously get #vaccinated https://t.co/FNvuIQDY3F
1/1	Seriously make it so the vaccines go to whoever signs up first... I'm tired of having to listen to Anti-vaccers rhetoric. If they don't want it its fine! There's alot more people who wants it now so they can stop worrying and go back to their usual life.
1/1	Seriously though. If you don‚Äôt want a vaccine, go the fuck home. Who the fuck are you to impose your mislead, ill-willed bullshit on everyone else? Sincerely, fuck off.
1/1	Seriously why so many dislikes? Please put in your part to making the world normal again!
1/1	Seriously, I met a nurse in the laundromat recently. He got his first dose of vaccine. He said he just got in the shortest line. Just get vaccinated!
1/1	Seriously, we all need vaccines.
1/1	Seriously. I get so annoyed with those that don‚Äôt believe that this is all abnormal. Like the people who believe the covid vaccine will turn them into zombies. Cant we ship them off to Pluto
1/1	Seriously. I‚Äôd love nothing more than getting the vaccine this very second. I‚Äôll probably get mine in maybe April if I‚Äôm lucky.
1/1	Seriously? Because our ancestors survived without vaccines, that's why we don't need vaccines? I guess the billions of people that could live today, if their ancestors wouldn't have died of measles, polio, etc., would say otherwise. Maybe ask the native Americans north and south, how many of their people died when Europeans brought them their diseases. They wouldn't have, though, if they would have been vaccinated. Got it? Or still too complicated for you?
1/1	Seriously? Okay. I was vaccinated in a third world country and I didn't die. Good enough
1/0	Seventy year old woman in good health. Moderna dose 1: sore arm ( couldn‚Äôt raise above shoulder height for a few days). Sore at injection site for about 3 weeks. Moderna dose 2: flu like symptoms, ice pick headache on right side, tingling on tongue right side. Symptoms gone within 48 hours. It wasn‚Äôt pleasant but I feel very fortunate to have been able to receive the vaccine. Would do it again.

0	She is absolutely right its poison keep it for the sheep never a pandemic never was we are being controlled!!! Mat hancock literally laughing at everyone says it all
1/1	She is correct. A shut down only will be able to cut down the chain of transmission. Vaccination is adding another one more arsenal into the armouryy of our fight against COVID but no vaccine as we know is 100 percent effective in Preventing the disease. So sense should prevail.
1/-1	She needs to listen to the doctor's
0/0	She refuses to take the covid vaccine even in the face of family pressure.
0/0	She says that it's not proven that the vacine prevents spreading the virus then says that one of the reasons she wants it is to protect her mother. Lol
0/0	She texted a friend less than half an hour after having it saying she felt terrible and very ill. It just got worse and worse until she passed. It‚Äôs a direct vaccine-caused death. 100%.

1/1	Short answer vaccinate you fucking kid
0	Short answer: "it's good until we tell you to get another one"
0/0	Short answer‚Ä¶ no. After the roll out and everyone gets one blah blah blah. Then I will consider the REAL risk benefit analysis. There is absolutely no way to make that assessment with all the unknowns in this scenario. Would it be worth it to me PERSONALLY if the risk was rhumatoid arthritis? Perhaps lupus or some other autoimmune disease? That would depend on the percentage of people developing the issues‚Ä¶
1/0	Short summary" trust the scientist"

1/-1	Should I still get it even tho I beat covid already my only symptoms was a mild headache
1/0	Should keep in mind that 80-90% of hospitalizations occur in about 15% of the population. Everyone doesn't need to be vaccinated in order to make a big difference.
0/0	Should never ever be forced or pushed into taking the vaccine. I won't be taking it. Gonna leave the Matrix
1/1	Should we just all stay inside our homes then for a couple more years??? The fans had covid tests and wore masks. Even the doctors say vaccines and herd immunity will do more good than just social distancing foreve
1/1/1	Should you laugh or cry. WANT A VACCINE NOW.
1/1	Should've mentioned this earlier, but I'm glad to hear that your mom got vaccinated; I imagine that reduces your stress considerably.
0/0	Should, could, maybe, what kind of science uses these words? Oh its an experimental frankenstein juice, my apologies.

0/0	Side Effects? Call it what it is, (EFFECTS) What do you expect with a Frankenstein's elixir created in months and tested not at all? You can have mine! ??????????
1/1	Side affects are common with any vaccination whether it be those our kids have as babies or the annual flu vaccine !! The side affects are a good thing in that it proves the vaccine is stimulating your immune system !!!
0/0	Side effect - death. Enough said
0/0/0/0/0	Side effect - death. Enough said.
1/1	Side effects > Death. Informative video.
0/0	Side effects according to studies come after the 2nd dose
0/0	Side effects according to studies come after the 2nd dose of vaccination.
0/0	Side effects also includes death.
0/-1	Side effects are never "normal", common maybe, but using the word normal to describe how you body is responding to being poisoned is a misnomer.
1/1	Side effects are rare and mild. I'm taking the vaccine!
1/-1	Side effects are so difficult to pinpoint since there are so many external (and internal) factors to be considered with each individual and whether there‚Äôs any clear common denominators with all these cases.
1	Side effects are temporary and minor just like what you would get from a flu shot
0/0	Side effects aren't always an instantaneous thing though. I don' think most people are asking for a 5 year trial or anything, but these things have been tested for what, a few months, at most?
0/1/0	Side effects include Bell‚Äôs palsy, rash, diarrhea, sensitivity to 5G, and erections lasting more than 4 hours
1/-1	Side effects include: may be less likely to die from Covid-19
0/0	Side effects of vaccines can take months or even years to show up, which is probably why it is being tried out on everyone working in the NHS. Showing up after only a day!! This particular vaccine has never been tried on mass human populations. They may hope to hide the side effects on NHS staff but I hope the staff are honest enough to publish serious side effects and especially deaths.
1/1	Side effects so far, sheer joy and gratefulness
1/1	Side effects usually kick in about 12 hours after the shot, but fade within 24 to 36 hours. The side effects are usually mild and transient. A sore arm at the injection site is the most common side effect from the vaccines.üëç
0/-1	Side effects worse after second dose straight out of the horse's mouth
1/0	Side effects, you get to live, youre welcome
0/0	Side effects. Will they really show us if there are serious ones? I don't know how true it is but someone was saying that a lady was paralyzed by it. I've been too lazy to look it up to verify it but I honestly don't trust these people to give us 100% truth.
1/1	Sign me right up, Joe! I‚Äôm fully vaxxed and looking forward to my 12 mos shot. I annually do my flu shot also. I‚Äôm guessing that eventually, flu and covid will be one in the same shot.

0/-1	Similarly, the CDC recommends that people not receive the second dose if they had a severe allergic reaction following the first dose.
0/0	Simple answer to the question posed. Indoctrination and forced compliance.
0	Simple as this, Don‚Äôt take it!
0/0	Simple explanation. A group of mad scientists with no souls created the COVID-19 virus and the same, said mad scientists with no souls created the vax. Souless creatures need to stop messing with dna or the outcome will be apocalyptic. GMO's, vaccines, wifi, etc have already caused cancer and auto-immune disease rates to sky-rocket. Thank the Lord I'm closer to my way out than my way in to this crazy world. Good luck with all this crazy stuff. Maybe they should just go back and occupy themselves with "reinventing the wheel". It'd be alot safer.

1/1	Since January 20, the Covid vaccination program proves to be an awe-inspiring example of presidential leadership and federal government orchestration. The speed and scale of the vaccinations have been astonishing.
1	Since it is an unproven, experimental vaccine, it's probably best we avoid 100% vaccination. That way if something unexpected happens there will be people left to repopulate.
0/0	Since it‚Äôs not really a vaccine by CDC definition, I think I‚Äôll take a pass
1/1	Since no vaccine has been approved for COVID, it‚Äôs not something to worry about. But overall, vaccines are generally safe. I don‚Äôt expect this one to be any different. If Health Canada approves one, I, as a Canadian , will not have any worries about getting it.
1/1	Since people cannot seem to be persuaded to wear a mask or practice safe distance, let's at least do that vaccination thing.
0/-1	Since the Covid-19 vaccine has been made available to the public 1. Coincidences have skyrocketed 2. The acceptable age for using ‚ÄúNatural Causes‚Äù as a cause of death has declined by decades 3. Side effects/Adverse reactions are a good thing
1/1/1	Since the beginning of this virus, I have been working with covid 19+ patients. Please vaccinate yourself and take care of people you love.
0/0	Since then we now know people do get sever allergic reactions, and many people reported here in the UK that they are still feeling very unwell after 5 days of having the Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	Since vaccination has been talked about during this pandemic and since the campaigns have started worldwide, I never heard one thing this video tells, explains and illustrate us! From now, I have a much better understanding of how vaccines work! Thank you Vox! (from France)
1/1	Since we made the vaccine and are testing I think then it‚Äôs gonna end soon
0/0	Since we still do not understand genetic Material you are playing with our lives. Stick to the Parts that Trigger.
0/0	Since when did not wanting to take a vaccine become a criminal offence? There's no way I'm taking a vaccine until it's been tested over many years... especially for a virus with such a low death rate!
0/-1	Since when does the government care about us
1/1	Sir thanks for helping 10th board Students.
0/0	Sir, but what did they do to develop this vaccine so fast....? Their fast development of the vaccine made everyone to disbelieve the efficacy of the vaccine.
1/-1	Sir,if people not following strict covid behaviour there is severe Need to bring lockdown
1/1	Sit back and relax. It will be this time next year until most of us see the vaccine. In meantime wear the mask, social distance, wash your hands, use sanitizer, and be careful too stay safe. God bless.

0	Sjaak sir we don‚Äôt know the long term effects of corona vaccine (it hasn‚Äôt even been made yet). I will refuse it. Clearly out of common sense that medicine should be tested for years.
1/1	Skepticism is good and healthy. Skepticism that persists beyond the point at which a reasonable person would be convinced by presented evidence is called delusion.
0/-1	Skepticism since vaccines take time to develop and long term effects are an unknown right now. We have every right to be aware of what we put into our bodies since we only get one body.
1/1	Small price to pay for a great reward. Life! Us lot in our 30s may never get close to be vaccinated.
1/1	Smallpox: Globally eradicated in 1980. Last case in Canada in 1962. History is proof that VACCINES WORK. Let‚Äôs send the #COVID19 pandemic to the archives! #COVIDVaccines #VaccinesWork

1/1	So 6 people out of almost 7 million had a reaction, but they don't know for sure if it is the actual vaccine per say? So 1 in a million chance you could have an adverse reaction to something that has a 90%+ efficacy rate to prevent something that has a higher chance of killing you if you contract it? Yeah, by all means, stop the presses.... We have idiots running the show.
0/-1	So Denmark,South Africa maybe Norway later this week have said NO TO THE ASTRA vacine..
1/1	So Ford would rather cancel a life saving vaccine ,limiting supply because someone might get hurt. All the while 10's of people die every day in Ontario from infection!! Let's just drag our feet for a few more months shall we??
1/1	So I am waiting to get my vaccine until more appointments become available in my area. And, that are closer to where I am.
0/0	So I can continue to gets shots OR just avoid it and roll the dice with a 99.7% survival rate? Tough choice
0/0	So I just read through alot of comments on this video, and have seen some things said that people took an extreme too. I have never been vaccinated, but I am not anti-vaccine, I am pro-choice. I believe that there needs to be more study on the vaccines that are on the market today. The flu vaccine does not prevent the flu, the covid-19 vaccine is not effective because it does not prevent covid-19. People should choose whether or not they should take a vaccine, it should not be forced upon them. The reason I will never take one is because I know what is in them. And the chemicals are surprisingly deadly, like mercury. I don't care if you guys hate on this comment, I just think that you should try to understand every side of the situation before you cast your opinions. I know people who have been saved by vaccines, and I know people who have lost their children to vaccines. There always two sides and neither side is wrong.
0/0	So I suppose the side effect of death is okie, dokie.
1/1	So I will likely take a vaccine but if I can choose, it will not be the first available and not rDNA based.
0/0	So I'm not anti vaxx, but this is the only vaccine I am not getting. They rushed it. We don't know exactly what will happen
1/-1	So I‚Äôm 64, an anti vaxer but got Phizer anyways.. I have allergies and an irregular heartbeat due to late menopause. I had fatigue, headache, sore arm, tiredness and a little dizzy. Went to bed and the next day it was gone.üòé
1/1	So Nice
1/1	So a doctor on the new this morning said her second dose in the trial gave her "robust" response. I kind of chuckled at that description. Usually when I get the flu shot, I feel bleh for a few hours, then I'm okay. My temp goes up, but not feverish, I get muscle aches and cold/hot. This time around I was on an immune system "cocktail" for a few weeks. when I got my flu shot I had no reaction except my sinuses seemed to clear up. I wonder if there have been any studies if things like Vitamin B, C, D, zinc, etc might lessen the side effects.
0/0	So after they have run the experimental vaccine using the oldies as labrats, they now decide that it's not safe for the youth to take. Jeesus!
0/-1	So all the people that got that covid vaccine shot doesn't mean you can't be re-infected you can still catch covid-19 even if you got the shot
0/0	So are you saying people should get one even it is NOT FDA approved and there is no information on long term side effects?
0/-1	So at some point science is going to have to be honest and tell people this is the flue and it's going to be here forever like all flues.
0/-1	So based on this information, given that the vacine is based on the virus and having the whole virus entering the body will have the same effect there would be no point to inject anybody with the vacine that already has had the virus and has antibodies in his/her bloodstream.
1/1	So basically anti vaxxers dont wash their hands since soap only kills 99.9% of germs
1/1	So basically vaccines train your body to become stronger-
0/0	So basically we are the test subjects and if it‚Äôs all good than America and the FDA will approve it.
0/0	So big brother forces you to do something that people feel is harmful to their children. Has any read what is in one vaccine shot? It's very surprising. Calling names like the people who don't believe "cavemen" doesn't help the situation.
0/1	So boosters for all... in perpetuity. Government is in total control of Medical care!üëç
0/0	So by the time you are unlucky enough to get globalist vaccine the mutations will be so powerful that vaccine will be rendered useless.And while they are telling you how bad you want the shot,you know it's bs. Where's the flu?where'd it go? Huh?!?
0/0	So can you explain to me , why did me and family get the flu shot last year. And All of us got so sick we almost ended up in the hospital ? I will Never get the flu shot again or COVID shot ! If it works so well then who ever gets it , shouldn‚Äôt worry if me and family don‚Äôt get it . Right ?because you will be safe from getting it.
1/1	So clear! I'll get 4 vaccines and 1 to go!
0/0	So deadly everyone I know who has had it, including those immunosurpressed have had zero symptoms. It was the vaccine they had which has made them really ill!
0/0	So don't want to be a lab rats.
0/0	So effective you'll need another shot in 6 months and one every year
0/0	So effective, Big Pharma needed to be exempt from any liability. ü§ì Now let that sink in...
1/0	So effective, more cases than ever before we have. Working so well
0/0	So enlightening to hear a thoughtful, balanced, and wise perspective on this. The contagion race to get vaccinated "at your own risk" is disturbing to say the least.
1/-1	So excited for you! One step closer to normalcy!
1/-1	So excited that this happened today. And feel very lucky to have access to the incredible organisation that is the NHS!
1/1	So excited to announce that i got the vaccine
1/1/1	So excited to get my first shot
1/1	So far 10 million vaccinations and only 40 allergic responses. So pretty good hope!!!
0/0	So far 2.78% of vaccinated persons developed adverse side effects and just after the first jab. The second jab will have a lot worse effects and the long term effects come later. This vaccination is completely unnecessary and in fact outright dangerous. It should be stopped.
1/1/1/1	So far all my grandparents, my mother in law, my step dad, 2 clinically vulnerable friends and my aunt and uncle have had the jab, which now is far more people than I know who‚Äôve had covid. To me that feels like we‚Äôre slowly winning.
0/0	So far in my own family....2 deaths hours after m RNA. 1 hospitalization 1 month after receiving m RNA vaccine
1/1	So far so good! Maybe a bit extra tired but I‚Äôve had a long day so I probably wouldn‚Äôt put it down to the vaccine.
1/1	So far the vaccines seem to provide equally good protection against the UK variant - which emerged in the autumn and has now become the main strain of the virus in circulation.
0/0	So far we have freedom to choose leave me alone never had a flu shot and I won't
1/1	So grateful for your excellent work and dedication to develop vaccine for COVID19.
1/1	So grateful to get my first COVID vaccine. We have lost too many and suffered so much. Let‚Äôs all do our part to help us all heal.
1/1	So half the population. We‚Äôre getting closer!!
1/1	So happy and proud to get my #CovidVaccine!! Thanks to the lovely Thelma, a former midwife, and all the other health professionals - it was super well organised and I am grateful!
1/1	So happy and proud to get my CovidVaccine!! Thanks to the lovely Thelma, a former midwife, and all the other health professionals - it was super well organised and I am grateful!
1/1	So happy the vaccines are finally helping me visit my family again
0/0	So happy they decided to rush out a largely unpredictable vaccine. Oh, and the fact that big pharma has no liability if it causes side effects or death. Way to go big brother. Idiots!!
1/1	So happy to get my 1st dose today, and at a mass Immunization site just 2 miles from my home. Many thanks to all the health care workers and support staff making this mass vaccination plan happen.
1/1	So happy to get my first shot of the covid-19 vaccine today, feel blessed.
1/1	So happy to have had my first Pfizer vaccine today x I can‚Äôt thank the scientists, NHS and all involved x
1/1	So happy to have my first dose ancious to get my second no bad side effects looking forward to saying goodbye to COVID
1/1	So happy to know my side effects to the second dose are a good thing. I can‚Äôt wait to feel better.
1/1	So happy to see people getting vaccines. I will get the vaccine ASAP
1/1/1	So happy we can get more to the folks who need them. Well done.
1/1/1	So happy you guys got your vaccine!!!!!
1/-1	So how long until the average person can get this vaccine?
1/1	So how many Germans have died due to not having a vaccination ! I bet this is considerably higher than restricting AV Vaccine?
1/-1	So hundreds of millions of people have received the COVID-19 vaccines without harm but it hasn‚Äôt been tested enough?
0/0	So if the vaccine only blocks symptoms, it sounds like it is just creating more asymptomatic spreaders of the virus rather than stopping it. I don't think you can call that a vaccine...a vector maybe..
0/0	So if this can be done in 10 months let get the cure for cancer by next week
0/0	So if we are doing a risk benefit analysis of getting the vax or contracting it naturally and my risk is very low of either dying or having permanent damage.... Then why am I getting this vax again?
1/1	So implausible. I believe you could call me at any time of the day or night offering a vaccine and I'd be there in ten minutes
0/0	So inject an experimental vaccine for an added 0.9% of survival... i‚Äôm good with 99% thanks
1/1/-1/1	So instead of a simulated attack, our own cells create the effect and the immune system attacks that and remembers it? Interesting
1/1/1	So it is becoming clearer that Pfizer's (and Moderna's too I'm guessing) vaccine is best in show, so to speak.
0/0	So it is useless vaccination .Let my body develope its own defence mechanism.
0/0	So it is useless vaccination üòÜ.Let my body develope its own defence mechanism.
0	So it makes you sick
0/0	So it takes the FDA about 5 to 10 years to allow a drug to come into the market, but they are okay with pushing a vaccine on the population of the earth within a year/year and a half at most? Also, who are the test subjects that were used, their age, their genetics, their smoking/drinking habits etc. If they're only using healthy people as their test subjects and that alone is only 95% that should worry a lot of people.
1/1	So it‚Äôs basically theory vs scientifically proved medicine
0/-1	So last night I'm at a party, Prob about 30 people there, nobody social distancing, no masks .love it, my kind of party...then out of nowhere we are talking to some lady and her 11 yr old daughter says out of nowhere, "just give me the dam shot so I can get on with life"....wtf!
0/0	So let me get something straight they over here suffocating us telling us we got to wear more than one mask because obviously one don't work we got to take more than one vaccine because obviously one don't work. we have people pass out and even die after taking the vaccine and we still got idiots that's lining up to take the vaccine they must not be educated on what has been happening to people who has taken the vaccine or either they do gambling with their life. Im not taking it I feel like if everyone around me has the shot and it's supposed to work so good I should be good then and don't need it. Same thing with mask if everyone around me has a mask on what the f I need to have one on for nah im good I'll just keep breathing in my oxygen while y'all keep breathing in your own toxic as carbon monoxide lmfao.
0/-1	So let me see if I have this right . The PM,his colleagues,family & friends get the $20.00 ‚ÄúA‚Äùgrade vaccine immediately . The rest of us get the $4.00 ‚ÄúB‚Äù grade vaccine some time in the next year or so . The capitalist call for the opening of borders to make it more dangerous.
0/1	So like the ps5. Everyone wants it. Nobody can get it. If you‚Äôre rich then u got it last month.
1/1	So many annecdotes.... so little evidence
1/1	So many emotions today while waiting and receiving my first covid vaccine! I chose faith over fear and hope for a better future
0/0	So many gullible wanting this experimental drug
1/1	So many more people will die by not taking it.. Rip to them.
0/0	So many people already died or got serious side effects from this "total, safe" vaccine with no longterm studies aswell i think i rather take the cance of 99,85% of surviving corona :)
0/1	So many people in these comments calling bullshit. So, where's your evidence that they're lying? Where is your evidence that doesn't come from companies that would benefit from lying? Companies that don't make money from the vaccines. How many of those say this is a lie? People accept things blindly, but if anyone here can accurately give me a website or a book or a company that has the criteria above, and is reliable, I will join the 'This is bullshit' side in a heartbeat.
1/1/1/1	So many people on here make it seem like vaccines are the worst thing in the world where people are literally making these vaccines to save lives. I'm all for the freedom of speech and ideas, but a bunch of y'all are stupid.
0/0	So many possible side effects.
0/-1	So many videos trying to convince and lie to people... who funds them
1/-1	So much fear around this vaccine and people firm on how they believe it works
1/1	So much for J&J. That vaccine is as safe as any other. But you can stick a fork in it. Nobody will take it now, they‚Äôll demand the others, even though there could very well be something extremely rare with those vaccines too. Of course many of these same people will bomb their liver with hard liquor, smoke, eat McDonalds 4 times a week and think nothing of it.
0/0	So much for getting vaccine!! Vaccine is not effective against new variant!! Do you'll just be going it again!!
1/1	So much has been made of the after-effect from dose two. I had Moderna and had NO side effects. Don‚Äôt be afraid people!
1/0	So much misinformation & anti-vaxxers out there. People don‚Äôt understand science or medicine. But health workers refusing is absurd as employers can demand it for the safety of patients.
1/1	So much negative feedback in these replies. I'm assuming those replying haven't lost anyone close to them to this virus. Happy to know.
1/1	So much negativity here as per Usual. We all should feel so grateful to the scientists ...
1/1	So much stupid in these comments. Anti Vaxxers, 45 supporters, and COVID deniers are the dumbest ppl on this planet. If believing in science makes me a sheep.. bahhhh Bish Bahhhh
0/-1	So my body my choice doesn't apply now huh lmaoo
0/0/0/0/0	So my take on this, it's experimental and dangerous
0/0	So my trauma from school and thinking I was a failure was upon me meeting the vaccination requirement? Lol. So I could of been whole this whole time. Thanks lol!!
1/1	So national lockdown for January, hold schools for two weeks so we can focus and push hard on a vaccination program
0/-1	So next year they'll say we need another one because like the flu it mutates.
1/1	So overjoyed that my Mum has now been vaccinated!
1/1	So pleased to be getting the vaccine
1/1	So pleased to hear Mum and Dad have their #vaccination tomorrow. #COVID19 has prevented seeing them for so long. Christmas felt especially hard as it did for so many of us. Shortly after Xmas I received this note in the post. It‚Äôs great to finally have hope of meeting again soon.
0/1	So proud of my fellow thinkers and the vaxxed team.
1/1	So proud of my grandpa. Today he got the first round of his
1/1	So proud of my grandpa. Today he got the first round of his #CovidVaccine
1/1	So proud of our state and the women leading the vaccine rollout here.
1	So proud of you for getting the vaccine. 45% of US population are AntiVaxxers
1/1	So proud to support the COVID-19 vaccination role out at Elland Road today. So exciting to be part of something so positive
1/1	So ready to be vaccinated!
0/0	So really the rest can wait for 2 years when the clinical trials are over...to be safe. Let's wait for the Guinea pigs results
1/1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine. We are going to be dealing with this virus for a while. Thanks for making an informative video.
0	So sad you are forcing our troops to take this sham of a vaccination
0/0	So sad. Masses have been brainwashed into an mRNA gene modifying experimental therapy called a vaccine. Virus recovery rate is better than the shot. People have completely turned off their brain.
1/0	So safe, definitely won't harm you. ;)
1/-1	So since your body requires the vaccine to produce the proteins, and this whole process is patented.
0/-1	So taking that vaccine so I can leave this world
1/1	So thankful i was able to receive the covid vaccines!!
1/1	So thankful that I was able to get my first vaccine today! Science at its best!
1/1	So thankful to receive my first Covid-19 vaccine
1/1	So the anti vax people want to die rather than being alive
0/0/0	So the disease said to be result of SARS-coV-2 infection causes blood clots.. who's to say these newly created approved for emergency use vaccines aren't causing some people to develop the covid-19 disease?
1/-1	So the doctors say it‚Äôs safe, the republicans that promotes the Senate insurrection say it‚Äôs not safe. WHO CAN YOU BELIEVE?
0/-1	So the genocide is generational now. First get rid of the elderly. Well in tradition‚Ä¶
0/0	So the older covid didn't kill enough so they got a new variant to pass around the world.
0/0	So the symptoms are the same as covid and the vaccination does not protect you?! You guys are a joke!
0/0	So the vaccines targets the spike protein in the virus. Yet the Spike protein is what is mutating aggressively in these new Variants. Uh oh
0/-1	So they are pretty much injecting you with the virus.
0/0	So they can come up with a vaccine for covid yet still can‚Äôt cure cancer. How about telling us what the long term side effects are u can‚Äôt cause u haven‚Äôt given it enough time. They want to give the elderly it first so they don‚Äôt have to pay them a pension n kill them off
0/0	So they expect people to take an untested rna/dna therapy that will edit their very being? Sorry....
0/0	So they plan killing off more Americans with this shot that has not been through enough time and trials
0/0	So they want us to take a vaccine from a company who made baby powder that causes ovarian cancer??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good try government!!! Not today
0/0	So they‚Äôre admitting they have no idea what they‚Äôre giving these people.
0/0	So they‚Äôre still collecting and analysing data. I thought all the relevant studies would have been conducted before mass vaccinating. What other findings may be discovered in future studies? I certainly won‚Äôt be a lab rat....
1/1	So this video saying that if i you get vaccine, you get resistance 3?? I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
1/1	So tired of this ... received my first dose of Astra, the time for my second dose is suddenly gone without explanation .. 6 pcs out of 6.8 million..suck just give me a vaccine now ..so tired ...
1/-1	So to be an antivaxxer I just find some random facts and state the opposite. Is that how it works?
0/0	So to be clear, you were ok until you had the ‚ÄòVaccine‚Äô, now you‚Äôre unwell....... Mmmmmmm, think I‚Äôll pass thanks!
1/1	So today I am getting my 2nd covid vaccine!! I am nervous but excited!! I am going into this believing all will be good.
0/0	So transparent that inital studies raw data are confidential and kept by labs until 2022/2023 ... Ahah
1/1	So true, this pandemic only really starts to get better when people all over the world are getting protected.
0/0	So we DOO have an immune system that can heal us without introducing unstable vaccines with little research and no long term cause information.
1/0	So we apparently know nothing about this virus yet weve managed to develeop a "vaccine" in 9 months
0/1	So we are guinea pigs? "take this stuff. It won't get you sick but you may get people sick". WT???" If the vaccine neutralized the virus in a person, how can it spread? By political magic?
1/1	So we don't trust the government and we don't trust big multinational companies. I get that. But when did we stop trusting doctors
0/0	So we get the vaccine but we can still get C-19, so we have to keep wearing masks and distancing! And we might have fever and muscle aches for 24-48 hours. Wow! Where can I sign up!!??
0/0	So we get the vaccine but we can still get C-19, so we still have to keep wearing masks and distancing! And we might have fever and muscle aches for 24-48 hours. Wow! Why the vaccine then!!??
0/0/0	So we gonna discuss the pentagon working on a microchip for covidor nah?
0/0	So we might either die from the virus or the vaccine?
1/1	So we need to get the vaccine out double quick with all haste . Use everyone inc volunteers to round everyone up and get it done 24 hours a day . That way we reach herd immunity and total protection in double quick time and then we can all start our new and rewarding lives sooner .....
0/-1	So we were right to be worried!!
0/0	So we won't be allowed to travel if we're not vaccinated? Where's our freedom there? Who's taking away our rights? It's crazy.
1/0	So weird the only side effect from the second covid vaccine I‚Äôve had was hearing a strange voice in the night say ‚Äúmicrochipping complete‚Äù
0/0	So we‚Äôre being good little boys and girls and getting vaccinated at the rate of 3 million a day. The three vaccine corporate giants will make over 32 billion dollars this year alone, and here comes another one to climb on the gravy train. Yet we‚Äôre now being told that we must continue to live in the kingdom of fear because we‚Äôre in another ‚Äòsurge‚Äô of the pandemic. So where is the evidence that the vaccines are doing any good?
0/0	So we‚Äôre just gonna ignore the fact that people die from the vaccine and also that those aren‚Äôt being recorded, the lady in this vid didn‚Äôt even get penetrated by the needle, because she knows the truth of the vaccine
1/1	So what everyone really needs to think about is do they want to risk getting the ACTUAL disease (which definitely has possible long-term side effects and even death), or getting the vaccine (which has shown very few if any minor side effects, and no major ones, and definitely NO death)? So like, risk lung damage/brain damage/death, or risk something that has harmed no one?
0/0	So what‚Äôs the long term effects ? Oh wait... you don‚Äôt know because nobody does
1/0	So when do the rest of us get to be vaccinated? Been waiting long enough. We have an economy to rebuild and they're vaccinating pensioners.
0/0	So when the vaccines start doing damage to the population we should jail the politicians and reporters who endorse it.
0	So when you both take the vaccine come back and give us your input! For the moment, no thank you..!
0/0	So when you both take the vaccine √∞≈∏‚Äô‚Ä∞ come back and give us your input! For the moment, no thank you..!
1/1	So where do we sign up and get in line for the vaccine
0/0	So where does the microchip go
0/0	So where in the submission from Moderna to the FDA do we find a statement that you would use as proof that the vaccine offers verifiable protection against symptoms, infection or transmission from sars-cov-2? Please quote the submission and link to it.
0/0	So why are we being forced to take it? these people are truly wicked.
0/-1	So why do you need the vaccine if you have already had the virus and recovered?
0/0	So why doesn't the medical studies show that it prevents infection? And why change the definition of vaccine?
0/0	So why has this still not been approved by the FDA then, yet the world is insisting on jabbing everyone with this?!?!
1/1	So why have we , the over 70 no say the we will take the Astro Zeneca vaccine. I am over 70 and sick of being put in a box. I want any vaccine ASAP. üò°
0/0	So why is the news reporting that people are testing positive for Covid-19 after getting the vaccine?
0/0	So why take it if I can still get the virus makes no sense
0/0/0	So why take the vaccine if it's not helping the virus why should I put that poison in me? I am not taking it it's all about controling humans and money
0/0	So why ya'lls still wearing your masks even after receiving the vaccine though
0/-1	So will a vaccine passport be required to vote? Think long & hard about that before you answer. Also, in the past why didn‚Äôt businesses require customers to show proof of a flu shot? Spread the same way. Selective/convenient circumstances for a current agenda. Go figure.
0/0	So yalk are happy with a vaccine that attaches to your DNA and changes it?
0	So yall want me to get the shot and the gov. Gives it free? And gov. Has their dirty little hands in health care huuuummmm that's like budwiser getting in the car insurance game. NO THANKS!!!!!!
1/-1	So you can‚Äôt get it right away?
0/0	So you get this experimental vaccine, you can still get Covid, still pass it to others, and still have to wear a mask and social distance. This also doesn‚Äôt highlight the countless individuals who were injured by this vaccine in the short amount of time since it‚Äôs rushed emergency approval.
0/0	So you got the vaccine and now six months later you need a booster, then of course more after that, hello ?? And all the while let‚Äôs make sure you wear your beautiful .. succaarrss.. I‚Äôd rather die. Hahahaha .. ‚ÄúDeath is not the worst of evils‚Äù, says John Stark !! NH
0/0	So you have a chance to die twice :D who wouldn't want that. Update: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Just answered that dudes question lets see if youtube will post it :o
1/1	So you have more chance of dying by driving 250 miles. I think this vaccine bashing really has to stop. That‚Äôs the issue doing real harm around Europe especially.
0/0	So you have more paid vax-loving failbook trolls in the UK I gather? That's why the three billion "vaxed" numbers we hear there? I'm terrified to even think what has already started happening..
0/0	So you should go ahead and trust their science. along with J &J and their lawsuits . Good Luck. They are criminal companies that make money and dont give a flying rats A$$ about you or science. They just want money and power.
0/0	So you want to change me genetically? NO thanks. Drugs are some times tested for years ,what this one 4 months No Thanks.
0/-1	So you're going 2 get the vaccine right. I want you to take live on YouTube
0/0	So your body constantly makes the spike.. Your immune system then attacks the spike... Isn't that going to lead to massive autoimmune diseases ???
0/0	So you‚Äôre gonna take something that‚Äôs 73% effective against a virus that has a 2% fatality rate ?????????? Uhhhhh
0	So ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶imma wait for y‚Äôall to take all three vaccines but so far I‚Äôm still scared to do so‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so bye
1/1	So, Dad‚Äôs now had his first dose of the vaccine!!....Mum‚Äôs turn tomorrow!!
1/1/1/1	So, I am in my late 40‚Äôs, due to my job, I‚Äôve had both my jabs already - Pfizer. Apart from a sore arm, I‚Äôve had no side effects at all. I can only speak from my own experience. All positive here. Feel lucky to have been vaccinated.
1/1	So, I just got an appointment to get my first Covid Vaccine! I get it on Saturday!! I'm excited and nervous about it. It's gonna feel great to be all vaccinated and everything.
0/0	So, I was wanting zombies from this virus. Maybe they'll come from the vaccine.
1/1	So, Pfizer vaccine side effects: nope, not me. Maybe a slight headache, but other than that, about 30 hours out, I feel fucking great!
0/0	So, according to this video (at 6:17) the DNA does get changed.
1/1	So, anyone who knows me knows I am very pro vaccinations. I have decided to lead by example and get vaccinated on Monday for Coronavirus so that I can better take care of my patients and serve my community!
1/1/1/1/1/1	So, basically, there's a silver lining of Covid-19: It showed humanity that there's a faster way to create vaccines now, so future pandemics can be stopped earlier, thus saving millions or even billions of potential lives in the future generations to come.
1/1	So, here's what I would say. Get the vaccination because A. the risks are smaller, but also B. It's in a controlled environment where scientists can continue to improve the formula. Covid is unpredictable because of variants in the wild.
0/0	So, how long do you expect to feel like sugar in 6 months from now when getting the next shot ? And then again in 12 months when you get the next shot ..... I am quiet a bit older than you are, but I had nowhere near all the ‚Äûside effects‚Äú you had with the vaccine when I got infected by the c virus !!!!! I am convinced the secret is to boost ones immune system to the max to fight off any virus and NOT a badly tested, unproven, short lived vaccine !
0/0	So, if this vaccine is supposed to save everyone, why are people still having to wear masks, stay apart and not travel. What is the point of taking the vaccine? I'll never take it.
1/-1	So, if you don‚Äôt die from it, you think it‚Äôs ok. What about all those who have been sick for weeks or months? I am surprised that there are still people saying it‚Äôs like a cold or a flu.
0/1	So, just to clarify, if I get the virus I have a 99.75% chance of surviving it without any medical intervention. Those odds increase if I get hospital treatment. Furthermore, I will develop a natural immunity which will be far superior and adaptable to variants than any vaccine. The vaccine which is untested, the period of protection could be as little as 90 days. The vaccine which cannot stop me from getting and transmitting the virus. The vaccine which could give me numerous other unknown side effects. And just to top it off I could die of a blood clot? Thanks for your offer... I'm fine! Keep your vaccine!
0/0	So, no liability for Pfizer. That is telling you how this vaccine is safe.
0/0	So, we are being used as Guinea pigs.
0/0	So.... bloodclots?
0/0	So.... the "truth" is, we still have a lot of unanswered questions
0/0	So...Getting the #COVID-19 vaccine... -Doesn't mean you can remove your mask -Doesn't mean you can stop social distancing -Doesn't mean we can end the lockdown -Doesn't make you immune to COVID-19 -Doesn't prevent you from getting COVID-19... So why get it?
0/0	So...the vaccine is safe BUT doesnt protect you from getting covid. How useless!
1/1	So? There is still value in getting vaccinated even knowing it's not 100% protection.
1/1	Social distancing measures, not the COVID-19 virus itself, have had the biggest negative impact on the economy. We need a vaccine
1/-1	Social distancing will be around until at least mid-2022. Manufacturing & distributing a vaccine to the entire species won‚Äôt happen in the next few months. We‚Äôll have to improve communications tech massively to keep everyone socially, emotionally, & psychologically fulfilled.
1/-1	Social media is already filling up with misinformation about a Covid-19 vaccine, months or years before one even exists.
0/0	Solution? Forget trying to influence your legislators. Boycott all pediatricians! Simple and effective.
1/1	Some anti vaxer said ‚Äúlet me guess your still in school‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah because I am vaccinated‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait for their reply
1/1	Some good news, my 95-year-old Grandma got her vaccine today. She said it didn't hurt, but then again Grandma is way tougher than me
1/1	Some good vaccine news today. Moderna says its vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against Covid-19 six months after the second dose.
1/1/1/1	Some measures need to be forced.
0/0	Some more propaganda for your feed.
1	Some of are you so pessimistic. It's a little bit of hope in the world. Perhaps it may not work, but we will see. No need to trash to the minds who are working day and night to create a safe vaccine for all us.
1/1	Some of our friends took the shoot and they are fine!! I am going to take it too!!
1/1	Some of these answers are deeply concerning. How will we convince our patients to get this vaccine with attitudes like these? I could understand it if there was actual data relating to safety concerns, but these ascientific comments about zombies and guinea pigs are wild. I would get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine without hesitation.
0/0	Some of us are immune to your lies
0/0/0/0	Some of us would like to keep our minds, body‚Äôs and souls thank you
0/0	Some of us would like to keep our minds, body‚Äôs and souls thank you üíú
1/1	Some of you feel the need to proclaim to the world that you don't want the vaccine. We really don't care. It's better for the world if you don't take it. Survival of the fittest. Bye Felicia.
0/0/0/0	Some people are dying from the vaccine no one reporting
0/0	Some people are still fighting to protect the system that is killing them, thinking they care about them and their health-they identify w/ their abuser, like a cult member. When you defend masks & vaccines, you are defending the system & that system is one based off of profits.
0/0	Some people are still getting COVID-19 after being vaccinated. Don‚Äôt trust this vaccine at all
1/-1	Some people are talking about some negative side effects, but I gotta say I've really enjoyed my upgrade from autism to super-mecha-autobot-autism. The 5G coverage is butt though
1/1	Some people don't deserve a platform. This virus has killed over half a million in the US alone. It's not a debate.
0/0	Some people have died from this vaccine. A lady fainted and died from it
0/0	Some people have seen claims that large numbers of people are getting seriously ill from the vaccine, that the risks of the vaccine aren‚Äôt being reported, or that officials know there are long-term risks but are keeping them secret.
0/0	Some people just say the vaccine helps because the creators say so and that people DON‚ÄôT DO RESEARCH. So no, I won‚Äôt take it‚Ä¶
0/0	Some people might not want to be injected by a drug that has been rushed through and with out knowing what s in the vaccine
1/1	Some people, including me, believe the vaccine may give them an opportunity to live without Covid-19. So... anti-vaxers, mind your own business and leave people to make their own decisions. A bunch of nit wits
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine.

1/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine. But I guess something is better than nothing...but I think I'll wait a little bit longer. üòé
1/-1	Some still believe covid-19 is a hoax..
0/0	Some vaccines do help, but a vaccine developed and researched in only a matter of weeks. Surprised you keep promoting the covid vaccine. If you want to be a guinea pig that is your choice, but quit encouraging others to do so.
0/0	Some?? Try 10s of thousands. This is month old news. Not even frontline workers want to be poisoned. Says a lot.
1/1	Somehow antivaxers believe in coincidences, how do they explain that polio is virtually nonexistent in countries with the highest rate of polio vaccine? It‚Äôs just that they won‚Äôt admit it.
0/0	Someone can have mine.......
0/0	Someone close to me had a stroke 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine. She also developed petechiae spots on her skin.
0/0/0/0	Someone died after injecting vaccine
0/0	Someone else can have mine I really don‚Äôt mind.
0/0/0	Someone else can have mine.
0/0	Someone just died after receiving the vaccine in placer county
0/0/0/0	Someone who doesn't want to be injected with an untested drug is not an antivaccine activist. He or she is just a sensible person.
0/0/0/0/0	Something big is going to happen soon.. I am not taking that shit ok.
0/-1	Something is NOT RIGHT about this vaccination crap
0/0	Something is not right. They have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/0	Something just feels so wrong about this vaccine‚Ä¶
0/-1	Something tells me this "survey" was asked to about 6 people.
0/0	Something that is safe shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory.
0/0/0/0	Something that is safe shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory. Wakeup people
1/1	Something we have been hearing in my area is that people are not going even if they qualify because they think others have a greater need than them. Don‚Äôt do this! If you currently qualify, go ASAP! Some of the major clinics near us have plenty of doses but not enough arms. They want and need you to go now.
1/-1	Sometimes I'm feeling that freedom is a double edge sword.
1/1	Sometimes I've heard people, people I care about, say, 'if I'm faithful, God's gonna take care of me.' What I would hope they might consider is that maybe a vaccine is a part of God's plan.
0/0	Sometimes sooner... so far 23 people died as a consequence of being vaccinated in Norway alone.
1/1	Sometimes vaccines won't protect you, same with eating veggies and excersising everyday won't ensure you live a long, happy life. But it does help.
0/-1	Soo many people lining up to join the cult
0/0	Soo......it is a test vaccin....:))) Go to Hell with this vaccin.....

0/0	Soon they are going to force us by taking away more and more of our normal lives when we refuse.
0/0	Soon we‚Äôll all be able to file class action lawsuits against platforms which prohibit our free speech against vaccines!
1/1	Sooo happy for you.. glad you went with vaccination

0/0	Sorry that I'm not afraid of something that has a 99% survival rate.
0/0	Sorry this vaccine about a virus that‚Äôs still not known enough is complete crap!! The flu vaccine is only 67% after how many years?? With a 98.9% recovery rate I‚Äôll take my chances.
0/0	Sorry to be blunt. All news channels are are full of sensationalist bollocks.
0/0	Sorry you had to take a vaccine for a disease that doesn‚Äôt exists. It is a bunch of generic symptoms that can be attributed to any disease that have been given a new name.
0/0	Sorry your vaccine is not safe
0/0	Sorry! I too am in the medical field but will NOT be running out to get this pushed through vaccine. I will wait to see how this all plays out. Too many uncertainties.
0/0	Sorry, but NO THANKS. You keep it and you take it
1/1	Sorry, i wish i could but we‚Äôre in Pakistan, where the term ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù regarding COVID doesn‚Äôt exist because our govt is waiting for ‚ÄúFREE STUFF‚Äù from you and any other country. So if you have any leftovers, please do give it us!
1/1	Sort of, but even if vaccines don't stop infections, they will cut down the amount of time they are replicating. Fewer replications before being cleared greatly reduces the speed of mutations arising.
1/1/1	Sounds like a great vaccine I am excited about it. Since my children have asthma problems.
0/0	Sounds like herd immunity will be here long before the vaccine - Also typically the virus mutates to have even milder symptoms than it does already to the extent that a vaccine is pointless.
0/0	Sounds like one is playing the Russian rulet when choosing to take the vaccine
1/1	Sounds like the vaccine did exactly what it's supposed to do. Keep you from becoming seriously ill. What's the problem?
0/0	Sounds more like indoctrination centers!!
0/0/0/0/0	Sounds to me like the beginning of planet of the apes
0/1	Sounds too good to be true this vaccine is a placebo üòÇ
1/0	Sounds wonderful, the caution comes when we have no data to tell us of the long term effects of the vaccine, I am talking years decades. now if you are elderly it's not a big issue, (how long do you have anyway), but for a young person?? seems risky.
1/1	South Korean Catholics express solidarity with Pope Francis‚Äô appeal for a vaccine-sharing campaign for poor countries that are unable to get life-saving Covid-19 vaccines.
1/1/1	Speaking as someone who works in pharma and has worked closely with these vaccines, I appreciate your support in science!

0/1	Start to depopulation just like gate and he's father wants is all documentaled stop watching tv

1/1	Stay safe, wear your mask and take the vaccine, so you won't infect others. Be wise
1/1	Staying at home while the vaccine is rolled out has made all the difference. The number of new COVID-19 infections in Barking and Dagenham has decreased dramatically in recent weeks. New daily infections are at a two-month low. Together we are keeping our community & NHS safe.

1/1	Super clear to understand n definitely gonna have to get the vaccine asap.^^
1/-1	Super helpful and informative. I've read articles about the difference between AstraZeneca vaccine and Jassen, only to realize they function the same. Several online news websites still deem, or at least make it sounds like, AstraZeneca uses the traditional harmless weakened version of common flu in chimps, as opposed to using Covid's spike DNA in a chimp-derived adenoviral vector. Thanks again, Vox, also for the great animation.

Then today my 96-year old aunt called from her assisted living residence, finally feeling like talking as she's fighting Covid, but she's beginning to improve. They have been on lockdown since the beginning and have only recently had Covid cases. Her best friend at the facility was buried today and she was feeling low. We cheered each other up, counting blessings. Times are hard for everyone, but if you still love this precious gift of life: Get the shot when offered.

Your immune system will not work as it should ... very definitely NOT about a virus" As for passports to travel ... there has never been a vaccine above 50% PROVEN efficacy ... never mind safety ! The present flu shot on gov.uk is given as an ESTIMATED 45% efficacy ... we have data that indicates MUCH lower ...so what's the point of that! The Russians have begun covid 'vaccinating' ... but only to hospital staff who have HAD covid ( it was on RT) .... the very people who already HAVE built in immunity and so they can say its a 90% efficacy!!!

1/1	Take #CoronaVaccine if not yet taken the 1st Dose and if illegibal as per guidelines
1/1	Take Corona Vaccine and protection to us
0/0	Take a Virus and inject into your vein.That is not safe.Proof:Soreness,fever,fatique and death were seen and recorded in many participants.6 people died in Pfizer vaccine trials.So,when will your body stop producing anti-bodies? or will it continue,like a car without brakes?One person side effects is TOO MANY.
1/1	Take a deep breath all will be well. I almost died from being allergic from the red dye in Motrin. Rare side effects can happen any time to anyone! The key is "rare."
1/0	Take a vaccine for a virus with a 99% survivability rate? No thanks. I'll take my chances. I've had the common cold (covid) many times. I lived. This is about control. Nothing more
0/0	Take an unproven vaccine whose manufacturers won't even take responsibility for bad outcomes, to avoid the sniffles? Nope.
0/0	Take care of my own immune system, stick that vaccine Where the sun does not shine,
0/1	Take control of your own lives and what you put in your bodies. Is not rocket science. That‚Äôs the only real preventive medicine.
0/0	Take fresh herbs they are all antiviral and stop worrying..The reason they wish so many vaccinated is to eliminate the control group. Yes, I do believe we can improve our immune systems functions of working to protect us. I just disagree with the methods used and imposed upon us. Vaccinations are toxic by their ingredients and cause an inflammatory response and in some cases can knock the immune system well off kilter. Building health with fresh herbs that are antimicrobial and antiviral, antibacterial etc, has no such issues. Mother nature has all the kindness, mans science has all the cut burn and poison. Which many of us now are trying to recover from.
1/1	Take it asap
1/1	Take it asap. Then can go overseas.
0/0	Take it from us . Early event after covid breakout in US is highly suggestive of big pharma conspiracy to spread covid in USA to create market for vaccines
1/1	Take it, don't take it. Each way is fine by me. Natural selection will sort it out. The dumb will die, which is a good outcome.
0/1	Take it. Your choice. I wish those taking it a happy after life.

1/1	Take the vaccine live for the gang √∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø
1/1	Take the vaccine on the weekend cause most everyone don't work on the weekends. I am planning on taking the vaccine over the weekend when it's available so I don't miss work on the weekdays. I don't have any allergic reactions to medicines so I can take this vaccine and I am protecting myself and my family and friends.
1/1	Take the vaccine or lose your job imo.
1/1	Take the vaccine when it‚Äôs available to you, maintain social distance, wash your hands, and use hand sanitizer. It will keep you out of the ICU and prevent you from unknowingly pass it to your loved ones. Don‚Äôt be a COVIDIOT.
1/1	Take the vaccine, stop COVID, protect yourself, your loved ones and society.
0/0	Take your shots and shove them. Stop people are not test rats. Now your going after the kids. Sick. Really the media Script readers need a lot of praying for. Bill nine the lieguy with a bow tie told us we live on a spinning ball and that‚Äôs a lie and now the vaccines. What a joke

0/0	Takes MRNA (Murder Right Now Anthony) to a whole new level. Also goes to show how pussified and stupid people are. They have been driven into a state of morbid fear (of absolutely nothing) to the point where they will stand in line, in the middle of the night, to get injected with a human pesticide containing an IGR, just so this poison doesn't go bad. Pure Darwin at work here. These pussified sheep will make the ultimate contribution to the gene pool. They'll remove themselves from it.
0/1/0/0	Taking Bill Gates vaccine lmao
1/0	Taking a vaccine is the price we pay for living in a modern society.
1/1/1	Taking anyone‚Äôs appointment who doesn‚Äôt want it ü•∞
1/1	Taking part in the Janssen vaccine trial on Tuesday, really excited to get the opportunity to help out.
0/0	Taking the pill doesn't cause autoimmune disease. This vaccine is causing blood clotting due via autoimmune disorders. So, it's very likely that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Autoimmune disorders may take years to manifest.
0/1	Taking the pill has far higher cases of thrombosis associated with it.
0/0	Taking the vaccine doesn't give any guarantee you are protected against Covid.
0/0	Taking the vaccine is the start of your loss of freedoms üá∫üá∏
0/0	Taking the vaccine means going againt Gods will
1/1	Taking your chances on catching Covid? And then maybe passing it along to 5 other people who don't want to take their chances and are waiting hoping for vaccine? And maybe dying or getting permanent lung damage? Taking that chance too? Not getting the vaccine is stupid

0/0/-1/0	Talk about the hiv in the vaccine
0/0	Talk til you are blue in the face...I AM NOT TAKING THAT DAMN VACCINE
1/0	Talk to me all you'd like, I will not voluntarily take the vaccine. It should be a choice, like getting a flu shot, which I have also never had. If you want the vaccine, then you should have easy access to it.
1/0	Talk to me in 5 or 10 years. Anyone who takes an unnecessary vaccine with unknown long-term term effects for a virus with a 99+% survival rate is a fool
0/-1/0	Talk to me like a normal person but I'm still not getting the flu shot,I mean covid-19 shot
1	Talked to my pcp, GI, and infectious disease specialist all whom said vaccine is safe with my condition and with the medications I‚Äôm on. Hope it helps!
1/1	Talking a shot takes a couple minutes and isn't terribly painful. Its the waiting that's annoying, yes, but I still don't get why people act like having to go get a shot is any different than going to the dentist or getting a check up. You take one day out of your oh-so precious time to see about your health then go on with your life. I guess they don't see dentists either...
1/-1	Tbf even though I'm pro vaccine, the first thing that would come to my mind would be if it killed someone to took it a week prior.
1/1	Tbh I‚Äôd MUCH rather get bad arthritis in my hands than to lose all my limbs from not getting a vaccine, but that‚Äôs just me
0/0	Tbh I‚Äôm not sure if I want one. Everything is done in such a hurry that I don‚Äôt believe it won‚Äôt have any side effects
1/1/1/1	Teacher over here Our district scheduled us to get the first round of the Pfizer vaccine on Thursday. Couldn't be more thrilled to be one step closer to having our students back in the classroom!
1/1	Teachers are essential workers and should have been in the first vaccine group anyway.
1/1	Teachers should be getting vaccinated.
0/0	Tell me how a vaccine can be developed so quickly when normally it takes years? There is no way they no the long term effects of this vaccine.
1/1	Tell me the time and date of my vacation and I‚Äôm there!
0/0	Tell me then...why are autoimmune diseases on the rise? Our bodies are attacking themselves because there is so much pollution in the atmosphere, and it's all going into our systems. The amount of vaccines we're giving our kids, and ourselves is over the top. Sometimes you need to pick and choose your poison I guess.
1/1	Tell me to my face that my four year old is just going to have give up another birthday party because you heard something bad about AZ on Facebook. And that you deserve Moderna more than the people for whom AZ presents an actual increased risk.
0/0	Tell them how people have died from this so-called vaxx or become very ill . Why don't you tell the truth ?
0/0	Tell us about the side effects 2-5 years from now
0/0	Tell us where does the DNA come from? Possibly from poor little aborted babies,? NO T HANK YOU!!!!!!!!
0/-1	Tell your parents you are not vaccinating your child‚Ä¶
1/1/1	Ten thousand covidiots didn't like this video. That's more vaccine available for the rest of us.
0/0	Ten years from now they‚Äôll be saying ‚ÄúIf you took the COVID vaccine you may be entitled to compensation‚Äù times are different now. They put strange stuff in our food and our vaccines that they didn‚Äôt when my grown children were young.
1/1	Tens of thousands of brave, healthy people around the world agreed to participate in these clinical trials. Over 90% effectiveness compared to people who didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs frankly great. It will honor their participation to follow‚Äîand keep us from getting sick
1/1	Tens of thousands of people have received the vaccine for testing, no one has died
1/1	Tens of thousands of people have received the vaccine for testing, no one has died.
1/0	Tens of thousands of people who have convictions for drug offences, fraud, dishonesty, assault, football hooliganism etc etc will soon find their future horizons are very limited, incl being barred from foreign holiday destinations, once Covid controls have been lifted.
0/0	Terrible and horrible if vaccine is like russian roulette with your life. Normal time for create vaccine is 10 to 15 years.
0	Test humans first then the lab rats
0/0	Test it on public officials first. Preferably those close to the top. If it works, then we are good. But if not, then they gotta try making it again.
1/1	Tested positive this morning. My wife did last week. We‚Äôd absolutely still get it.
0/0	Testing an untested gene therapy drug on children sounds beyond stupid and evil. Since this minor pandemic began the "experts" have contradicted themselves many times. People cant be gullible and trust the so called experts like Bill Gates or Bill Nye. Or even Fauci who has changed his story a bunch of times.
1/-1	ThIs Is JuSt AnTi AnTi VaX pRoPoGaNdA!!!
0/0	Thalidomide was said to be safe My mother was offered it but refused.
1/1/1	Than what explanation is for those children who received vaccines and are fine? That some vaccines are tainted? And the lucky children had an untainted vaccine?
1/1	Thank God! when I get my jab, I will probably cry in relief and thankfulness.
0/0	Thank God, most of the people on this video are intelligent enough to not take an untested vaccine and by testing, the average vaccine takes 15-20 years, this vaccine is being pushed out in less than a year. No thank you!
1/1	Thank Science! It's finally happening. Happy, happy day. Long way to go but it's a start.
0/0	Thank You I use a Homeopath only. I don‚Äôt go to medical doctors. As a rule they don‚Äôt know how to cure a thing. Most never look at the cause, they only treat a symptoms and give no thought to what they do to the rest of the body. Therefore I use natural methods.

0/0	Thank you Christian. You have put into words what I want to say. Truthfully, I have not done the research, but what you have said is what I want my family to know. I have also had COVID and do not plan on getting the "shot" (I won't even call it a vaccine) at all.
1	Thank you Doctors. Hope it is successful and safe for humans and not become zombies as side effects.
1/1	Thank you Dr Hanson. That was very informative and helpful information. Will you keep us updated on progress with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?

1/1/1/1	Thank you I will take it
1	Thank you Mr President for keeping your word to have vaccinations as quickly as possible for all those who want them. As one of the 1st to get the vaccine I know the relief that comes with being protected & I‚Äôm so happy that more & more are experiencing this relief
1/1	Thank you Nikki. Now if everyone else who is eligible would get their vaccinations, we could whip this virus and get back to (close to) normal.
1/1	Thank you Pfizer for saving the world your vaccine is the best
1/1/1/1	Thank you Pfizer for the COVID-19 vaccine! My husband and I who are in the 65 and over category just received our first injection.

1/1	Thank you Pfizer!!!
1/1	Thank you Pfizer, today my husband and I got our first dose of the vaccine. No adverse reaction to it just a headache, sore arm and a bit of dizziness. Thank you so much !!
1/1/1	Thank you President Biden! Now if Americans could just care enough about the lives of other Americans to wear a mask until a great majority are fully vaccinated we could beat this nightmare virus.
1/1	Thank you President Biden. I am hoping that there will be a focus on vaccinating teachers, school support staff, students and parents prior to mandating that schools reopen within 100 days.
1/1	Thank you President Trump for Operation Warp Speed which helped get these vaccines developed.
1/1	Thank you again to the international science community for developing this vaccine. And a big thanks today to the UK's independent regulator for testing and approving its rollout. Proof that the UK can be world leading, when free from the interference of the political "leadership" and the awarding of contracts to unqualified cronies. Leave the rollout to the vaccination and logistics experts.
1/1	Thank you all for doing a great job well done may God bless you always,it's great feeling the va√ßcines are Here hope for humanities world wide,
1/1	Thank you all for sharing. I can‚Äôt Wait to get my vaccine! No sarcasm. I‚Äôm so ready for some form of normal and not being a prisoner in my own home! How can I move up the line?

0/0	Thank you folks, for making known and exposing the sane minded MINORITY that's not completely comfortable with FORCED vaccine
1/1	Thank you for all you do. I love your family. I will get the vaccine as soon as I can as well
1/-1	Thank you for being such a sound minded middle ground person. We need more of them. People try and make vaccines so black and white when it‚Äôs not.
0/0	Thank you for covering this. I have a history of allergic reactions and when I tell people why im hesitant on vaccination (for now) they just keep saying "you read too many conspiracies on the internet" but my concerns are legitimate.
1/1	Thank you for educating us! Please everyone get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn. It's the least we can do for our loved ones.
1/1	Thank you for explaining the MRNA vaccine!! It was so much more understandable when you broke it down. I‚Äôm getting the vaccine on Tuesday the 22nd since I‚Äôm considered a frontline worker. Many people I‚Äôve talked to in my community are worried to get it but with all the scientific information I‚Äôve read it is safe. I‚Äôm not scared at all. And I hope more people do their own research.
1/1	Thank you for explaining what is meant my ‚Äúrushing‚Äù the vaccine. I wish all news channels would take the time to explain this and help dispel ignorance and fear.
1/1	Thank you for finding the vaccine for Covid 19 so we all can have hope for the new year, Pfizer.
1/1	Thank you for getting it! I can't wait!

1/1	Thank you for helping to save lives. We appreciate all the hard work done by Pfizer team members. Great, brilliant work. Vaccines work. Vaccines are safe. Thank you Pfizer!!!
1/1	Thank you for making this video I see so much misinformation going around about this vaccine
1/1	Thank you for making this video. I am getting mine on Thursday, and I am super scared
1/1	Thank you for making this video. It really made me feel better about getting a vaccine.

1/1	Thank you for sharing your experience and answering common questions for all of us. üíïüôèüèºüòò I will definitely be getting the vaccine when it is made available to my demographic.
1/-1	Thank you for sharing! I am very much interested to hear more of your experience with the vaccine
1/1	Thank you for sharing. Getting my second dose next week.
1/1	Thank you for taking responsibility! Also...nice band-aid!
1/1	Thank you for the ad and I had my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday!
1/1	Thank you for the beginning of the end of COVID! Got my first shot 2 days ago, no problems.
0/0	Thank you for the detailed scientific explanation. Can we be assured this vaccination is perfectly safe? Can we really trust Pfizer/Big Pharma? Do you have complete trust in Pfizer and in the clinical trials? Personally, I have no trust in them. They are immune from liability lawsuits. I guess when you have that much money and power, you are untouchable.
1/-1	Thank you for the great info. My question is if the spike protein (created by our cell's ribosomes) are expressed on our own cells, wouldn't our immune system then attack our cells?
1/1	Thank you for the info I‚Äôm getting my vaccine in two weeks
1/1	Thank you for the neat breakdown. Hopefully, people will actually learn something for once from this and take the vaccine
1/1	Thank you for the neat breakdown. Hopefully, people will actually learn something for once from this.
0/0	Thank you for the update on Covid-19 Vaccine. I am one who will be afraid to take an early vaccine like this. Be careful out there.
1/1	Thank you for the update sir. I am having my jab next week it will the Astrazeneca :)
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine against the covid 19. Thank you very much. Really the people need to be vaccinated. Mandatory vaccines in the United States airports. That's only way to vaccinate a lot of people. The vaccines are important to avoid diseases. Thank you. The airports need vaccines or everybody!!
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine!!!
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine!!!!
0/-1	Thank you for the video, however instead of COVID VAccine you should say/write Pfizer Vaccine because there is a big difference between Pfizer Vaccine and Oxford etc...
1/-1	Thank you for this :)
1/-1	Thank you for this concise and informative discussion. I appreciate that you were able to simplify such a complex topic without glossing over its scientific basis. That is not always easy to do, but I have seen it consistently done in your many COVID presentations. I think MedCram provides the best science-based information on the internet for public consumption and have recommended you to nearly everyone I know.
1/1/1	Thank you for this honest review. I will now be well prepared to face any challenge my 2nd dose brings. ( I‚Äôm not interested in all the long term affects of Covid patients are reporting). No thanks; I‚Äôll take the vaccine!
1/1	Thank you for this information. It‚Äôs very informing. I am currently enrolled in the AstraZeneca vaccine trial. I have not yet received a vaccine or placebo.
1/1	Thank you for this video, this cleared a lot for me. I was too thinking in terms efficacy rate and thinking that a vaccine should make invincible against Corona but I see a clear perspective here now! Take vaccine and avoid strong symptoms, hospitalisation and death!
1/1/1/1	Thank you for this! Going to share! Dr Seema perfectly articulates what I explained to my family and friends who naturally have reservations about the vaccine.
1/1	Thank you for this! I'm a young person, but I work with the public. I live in a rural area and my local health dept. has a standby list for vaccines that my boss signed me up for when she learned about it (she knew I'd want to be on it). I get the first of the Moderna vaccines tomorrow. I've never been excited to get a shot before, but I certainly am now!
1/1	Thank you for this, about to get the Pfizer tomorrow
1/1	Thank you for this. Hopefully it will bring a few people back from lunacy. The problem is that most people have forgotten how bad small pox and measles are. These are serious diseases!
1/1	Thank you for this. My college just made free J+J vaccines available to us (and I'm getting mine tomorrow), and I was concerned it might not be worth it, and was considering waiting to get a two-dose vaccine later. I feel better now about getting the Fauci Ouchy tomorrow!
1/1	Thank you for this. The vaccine is to help prevent the need for hospitalization, oxygen requirement or death. Even with the regular flu vaccine, one can still get the flu, but the symptoms should not be severe.
1/1/1	Thank you for vaccinating my 95 year old father who is in an assisted care facility. He got his 2nd shot one week ago and had zero side effects. So grateful and so hopeful.
1/-1	Thank you for your brilliance and making an additional deal with the United States for more vaccine
1/1	Thank you for your enormous work, so difficult in this moment. Vaccination is an act of civilization. We have to take care of each other.

1/1	Thank you science for ending this pandemic
1/1	Thank you so much Dr. med. Seheult for your education. üåº A user in the comment section reported that these mRNA-DNA vaccinations would work just like the dengue fever vaccination. Ask for clarification, thank you. üôè
1/1	Thank you so much for accepting me into this group. I had my first Pfizer vaccine last Friday, and look forward to doing a few more things thanks to medical science!
1/1	Thank you so much for actively taking part in stopping the spread of COVID-19
1/1	Thank you so much for pouring millions of dollars into your research to ensure your vaccine continually is safe and effective for all patients, Pfizer!! Your dedication is apparent with all the quality data that we are seeing
1/-1	Thank you so much for sharing this information, your knowledge with us
1/1	Thank you so much for this - beautifully clear! Do you know whether there have been any studies testing whether mixing vaccines is as effective and safe as dosing with a single vaccine?
1/1	Thank you so much for this informative video. I just had my first Pfizer shot at Walmart. Great experience!! They were awesome! No side effects so far. It‚Äôs been 2 days. Not happy to hear symptoms can sneak up after 10 days üò¨ and not looking forward to #2 but will do it and grateful to be protected. My daughter had both Pfizer doses and she only had a headache after #2.
1/-1	Thank you so much for this video I'll be sleeping better tonight
1/1	Thank you so much for this video! Without it, the vaccine was just a 'thing' with the face of a company being discussed politically. This made me feel more connected to the scientists behind its research. I really appreciate it.
1/0	Thank you so much for this video. As someone who has reactions to other vaccines (flu, etc.), I was nervous about this one (Pfizer) but I only had a immune response (and also some mild hives that I reported to v-safe). I studied the ingredients and I think it should be noted that the mRNA vaccines have no preservatives, heavy metals, or antibiotics which is by far the "cleanest" vaccine I've had (which probably helped with no adverse events, in my case). Also, since I'm a researcher in the sciences (benchwork and beyond), I already knew that the basic components disintegrate fairly fast so long-term effects from the vaccine itself is small. Please mention to individuals getting the vaccine that it's wise to layoff the anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen, and alcohol for about 48 hours prior to the jab to 72 hours post-jab. I know many people taking Aleve, etc. a few hours before their appointment in anticipation of the effects.. we want our immune system to be full-on during the vaccine process. A little discomfort is worth it for a day or so. Rarely do I hear doctors telling this sound advice. If ever we needed PSAs .. it's now.
1	Thank you so much for this wonderful video. Intelligent, informative and extremely clear and honest. Hopefully it will convince people who are worried about taking the vaccine to receive it.
1/1	Thank you so much for your excellent update. Stay safe!

1/1	Thank you so much. My family is scared of getting the vaccine so I showed them this video and it really helped. "You fear what you dont know"
1/1/1	Thank you so much. Understanding the work of the vaccine really helped me. On target affects. Go science!
1/1	Thank you that you finally said something about side effects, more people are assured and want to take a vaccine

1/1	Thank you very much for this clear information and for your most valuable work. Vaccines are the only way to get rid of this pandemic
1/1	Thank you üòä tomorrow is my day for a vaccination! Grateful for the science üôè
1/1	Thank you! I feel sorry how your company was treated. You gave a vaccine at cost to the world but found just suspicion and EU tantrums. Keep up the good work AZ, hopefully history will make you right
1/1	Thank you! I hope y'all continue to stay as safe over there in California as possible, and that you are able get your vaccines when you're able to!
1/1	Thank you!!! This make sense. I always liked the science of the JnJ vaccine more than pfizer and Moderna (which are mRNA), but wasnt sure since the efficacy rate was so much lower. Whatever is offer to me, I will now take.
1/-1	Thank you!!!!!! My daughter is in a high risk group even though she‚Äôs only 14!! So many times, the media doesn‚Äôt think of people like us. We have been isolated for over a year to protect her. Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!
0/0	Thank you!Give my portion to someone else!I don't trust ur advertising HSE!Once you take full responsability of the negative effects of the vaccine,i am in,if not,keep it for yourself!
1/1	Thank you, Dr Kariko, Dr Weissman, and the entire Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna teams!
1/-1	Thank you, I was looking for this very thing- explained clearly, much appreciated.
1/1	Thank you, Science, for my 1st #CovidVaccine. With no sign of a 2nd dose in sight, I will continue to #WearAMask.
1	Thank you, but where to get them?
1/1	Thank you, for that verified information we have no choice but to believe and take it.
1/1	Thank you, had my vaccination yesterday. I am one of many that appreciates what you are doing.
1/1	Thank you, hopefully when everyone can receive a vaccine we can see our families and friends again!
1/1	Thank you, these informative communications are always useful and welcome. At the same time I think that at the moment the critical part is to find ways to expedite production and administration of the vaccines. There are many willing to get the shot that still need to wait. #iamhere
1/0	Thank you. And they are trying their best to convince us that a fast track is going to be safe. If true, that means that all the long-term studies that have been done (and required by law) have been for nothing. Either that, or they are feeding us a load of lies, due to the enormous amount of money involved in the ones who can do this first, second and third. Let them take the money incentive away completely, and we will see a complete collapse of experimental vaccines for Covid 19. Human lives are nothing compared to money.
0/0	Thank you. But what about its effect on old people. There are evidence in some countries that it is causing death to them. You should be transparent and clarify more.
1/1	Thank you. I loved the way you presented the facts. üá®üá¶. As a member of the older generation I have no fear of vaccines. As a child I had the usual polio, smallpox, whooping cough and diphtheria. In the last two years I‚Äôve had Twinrix, Dukoral oral vaccine, Shingrix, a Tetanus booster, the pneumonia vaccine and the flu shot. I have also had my first dose of Pfizer.
1/1/0	Thank you. I needed this broken down simply and you achieved that.
1/1	Thank you. Thank you scientists, lab techs, logistics professionals, truck drivers and all involved in this Herculean effort.
1/1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine
1/1	Thank your covid-19 vaccine explanation clearly . Congratulations üôè for your health education over world üåè wide.
1/1	Thank your covid-19 vaccine explanation clearly . Congratulations üôè for your health education over world üåè wide. Good luck doctor & Happy Sweet December üéÑ
1/-1	Thank youüíôüíôüíôüíô
0/0	Thankful for a voice of sound reason in the chaos. As a healthy 57 year old with no co-morbidities I have no plans to take the vaccine anytime soon and certainly not before the plethora of 70+ and 80+ year old friends I have!
1/1	Thanks Doc.. Very interesting facts. Your humor ü§£üòÇwas enjoyable üòâ Waiting for a good day....to get vaccinated, lol
1/1	Thanks Joe! And thanks to all the scientists that made this happen. They do the heavy lifting, and never seem to get the credit they deserve.
1/1	Thanks John. I still hope to get Astra Zenneca as well. You inspire hope. I looked far and wide to avoid the 55 to 65 rule.
1/1	Thanks Mr President we are sure to follow your beautiful examplary measures #takevaccine
1/-1	Thanks Renia for getting.
1/-1	Thanks UNICEF for your lovely effort to save the life of the universe
1/1	Thanks be to God -Now lets get it into the arms of everyone PDQ!
1/1	Thanks be toGod for vaccine
0/0	Thanks but no thanks, I'll focus on health instead
0/0	Thanks but no thanks. Inherent immune systems in the healthy do quite well.
1/1	Thanks doctor for this video...and also giving us assurance..regarding this vaccine...
0/0	Thanks for being a guinea pig. I have some other products needing testing... interested?
1/1/1/1	Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine!
0/0	Thanks for getting the shot. We need to reduce the population.
1/1	Thanks for getting vaccinated. Hope everyone does when they get the chance. I‚Äôm a little nervous but I will definitely do it.
1/1	Thanks for posting this video. I get my second dose at the end of this month, so at least I know (kind of) what to expect. If I have the chills and nausea and all that, it sounds like the flu. so nothing I haven't been through before. I didn't have any reaction to the first dose besides my arm being slightly sore. I felt better after watching this and knowing that we're all going through this. Getting the shot is way better than getting covid.
1/1	Thanks for posting this! How exciting. If I were healthy I‚Äôd‚Äôve volunteered. But I‚Äôm fat, old, and partially blind so I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me.
1/1	Thanks for saving all those lives.
1/1	Thanks for sharing and giving a good example. My 2 sons in the frontline also got theirs. Those who are scared of the vaccine I ask - How many died from COVID19 ? 350,000 +. How many from the vaccine ? Zero. It's a no brainer.
1/-1	Thanks for sharing your experience! :) Hope you have a happy and healthy new year!
1/1	Thanks for sharing your informations to educate people !!!! ....I saluted W.H.O
1/1	Thanks for sharing your vaccine experience. Stay safe!
1/1	Thanks for the article. I agree. I have had the COVID, but will take the vaccine when it is available. We should be grateful that we live in a country such as this, where we have wealth and great companies. My wife is from Colombia and it will be a long time before they get the vaccine.
1/1	Thanks for the good job you are doing I still waiting when ever it comes I will go and take my.
1/1	Thanks for the great informative video and effort! But ... god makes the comment section my brain hurt sigh
1/1	Thanks for the info doctor! I can't wait to get my shot.
1	Thanks for the info. Me and my Mom will be getting our first injections of the Moderna tomorrow.
1/1	Thanks for the info...will be getting mine soon, need to protect not only myself but my children and grandchildren. Side affects seem small compared to risk of death.
0/0	Thanks for the military numbers. As a member of the Army I won‚Äôt get it until it‚Äôs an order. Then I can make my medical claims in 10 years. You can‚Äôt make claims against something you ‚Äúvolunteered‚Äù for.
1/1	Thanks for the post! Especially grateful for the note about how we aren‚Äôt bragging with our post-vax selfies but being #vaccinesafetyadvocates! I got my 1st dose today (student social worker here) and so far no side effects bar a slightly sore arm. Hope you‚Äôre feeling much better!!
1/-1	Thanks for the update!!
1/1	Thanks for the vaccine today means I‚Äôll be a lot more safer and so will others too
1/1	Thanks for the vaccine!! <3
1/1	Thanks for the vaccine, amazing snd dedicated team at moderna. Science rocks! Btw- no issues for me with either dose of the moderna vaccine!
1/1	Thanks for the video. Should I take rna vaccine or wait for the more traditional ones like Oxford that still has DNA but delivered using a chimpanzee cold virus?
1/1	Thanks for this highly educational video. I‚Äôm gonna share as much as I can and people can understand how the vaccine can protect everyone
1/-1	Thanks for this informative video that I can share to those who are skeptical of the vaccine.
1/-1	Thanks for this very informative video! Can't wait to get the jab.
1/1	Thanks for this video :) really hoping this gets out soon
1/1	Thanks for this video ?? vaccine is here already and it‚Äôs rolling great.
0/0	Thanks for this. More direct proof of Bill Gates‚Äô plan for world depopulation. Seriously though, anyone who gets these suicidal injections is an idiot.
1/1/1	Thanks for this. Nothing new for me as I already understood this information, but for everyone else that doesn't know, this is super valuable to know. I had the Janssen vax last week and now feel even better about my decision to get that one in particular.
1/1	Thanks for this... this science is awesome.
1/1	Thanks for vaccines
1/1	Thanks for your initiative to make Vaccines available to all countries. Otherwise,it will not be possible to fight against this deadly Virus. Today while world are suffering. So, we should work together to eradicate from all over the world. God bless us.
1/1	Thanks from everyone for doing this!
1/1	Thanks so much @moderna_tx for helping so many of us put this pandemic behind us! I got my first shot of your vaccine and wanted to give you a heartfelt #thankyou.
1/1	Thanks so much for this excellent explanation! You‚Äôre doing a real service to the community. Keep up the great work.
1/1	Thanks so much for this in-depth analysis of these vaccines. Your work is highly appreciated.
1/-1	Thanks so much for your informative easy to understand lectures. I've been following since early in the pandemic. Still taking vitamin D!
1/1	Thanks so much, I've been on the fence since the vaccines became available. It's mid March and finally decided to take it. Your video answered every question I had, I'm extremely grateful. 60yr. old and not in the best of health, but moving forward with vaccine and hoping for the best.... God bless.
1/1	Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister @erna_solberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines.
0/-1	Thanks to President Donald Trump the vaccine is going out today .
1	Thanks to World Health Organization: your hard work for r safety and wellness of all human beings is important. The vaccines are safe and vaccination is the only way to get out from this tragic pandemic. Thanks and go on!! ‚ù§

1/1	Thanks to all the scientists who developed the vaccine(s) in no time and the frontline workers for their tireless work. I wish everyone can get their vaccine soon. #moderna
1/1	Thanks to my dear friend and colleague Rep. Barbara Cooper for leading by example. Please get vaccinated when able. #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
1/-1	Thanks to my government for playing with 7000 fresh doctors for not issuing them KMC registration.
1/1	Thanks to our fantastic teams across Wales, more than 500,000 people have been vaccinated. Every vaccine's a small victory.
1/1	Thanks to scientists, government & private sector, my mother got her COVID vaccine today. No pain or fatigue. Just protection & peace of mind.
1/-1	Thanks to sir please retirement benefits for the daily wage casual labor in ICAR-Central Institute research on goats and other Institutes serve since 35 to 40 th years longest period with leav in cashment theirs old life management problems and their families Economic problems.
1/1/1	Thanks to vaccinees lots of dangerous viruses are under control like smallpox and many others to many to mention, so yes I am taking it as soon as it is available to me.
1/1	Thanks to you President Biden for getting the ball rolling for us to get the COVID19 shot. I will be receiving the second shot this coming Wednesday, March 31st.
1/1	Thanks very much for this Dr. Campbell. Had the AstraZeneca jab about 10 days ago with no side-effects other than a slightly sore arm at the injection site. Looking forward to getting the booster! It's a beautiful spring day here in southern Ontario, Canada. Can almost see that "light at the end of the tunnel".
0/0	Thanks, but I will refuse any of them.
1/1	Thanks, that is awesome. I went to a mass vax drive thru today and it was so well organized and easy. Appreciate what you‚Äôre doing.
0/0	Thanks, this only confirms that C-19 vaccines can be dangerous
0/0	Thanks. but knowing what big pharma is capable of. I think I'll just use battery acid instead!
1/-1	Thanksüôè
1/1	Thankyou Doctor.... Really true ..i have also taken vaccination on the same day you have... My experience is same all good ...Ashwani Unicef..
1/1/1	Thankyou for helping yourself and the rest of the world. Much love
0/0	That 1/2 dose by "error" seems very sketchy. I would want to see how they justify it in the paper.
0/0	That BAME vaccine chestnut is pending for the media next to be pushed , no thanks not interested in your poison
1/0	That Guy: Less than 1% of people die from COVID! Same Guy: 6 PEOPLE GOT A BLOOD CLOT FROM THE J&J VACCINE! YOU'VE GOT TO BE INSANE TO TAKE IT!!!
0/0	That could be a paper card ‚Äì or a tiny tattoo on their arm, invisible to the naked eye but readable by an infrared scanner. This technology already exists and has been tried on live animals and human cadaver skin, said researcher Ana Jaklenec at [MIT] Their method uses micro-needle patches that can deliver both the vaccine and a squirt of an invisible ink under the person‚Äôs skin, storing the vaccination record.
1/1	That disease killed millions of people every day, it needs to be stopped
0/-1	That doesnt sound socialist/communist does it? Either take our sham vaccine for the scam C19 OR you go on a list of dangerous subversives who we will lock out of society.
0	That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that there is no long term Human trials. There isn‚Äôt, it is nonexistent.
0/0	That effin vaccine killed my mother today. She was fine before getting it. Do not take it EVER
1/1	That feeling when your whole staff has finally gotten their first dose of the jolene vaccine in their systems It‚Äôs gonna be a much better weekend now!!!
0/0	That is a definite no to the vaccine. I will rely on my immune system and the good Lord.
1/-1	That is a person who is not going to believe the data no matter what you tell them. They think pharmaceutical companies have the government in their pocket ... they are not going to believe anything you tell them
1/1	That is all vaccines do- they train your body to recognize and fight the virus so that your body does not get overwhelmed.
1/1	That is awsomeüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºi wish Denmark were more effective. We are sooooo slow hereü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæonly about70.000 have received the vaccine hereüôÑ
1/-1	That is false information. This is a vaccine, not something strange and unheard of. And it is not gene therapy. It is just a vaccine.
1/1	That is great news. This man is a world treasure.
1/1	That is really good news wow there is some negative comments bout the vaccine but I think it‚Äôs a great break through and I will defo have it I‚Äôm a care assistant for elderly people with dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs and diabetic so I think it makes sense
1/1	That is so good to hear JR. My parents got their first shots this past weekend.
0/0	That is the definition of stupidity. We gave you a vaccine that we know nothing about, in fact take two doses and we will wait and see how it works out. Ahhh stupidity has no bounds
1/1	That is the finding of all Vaccines, there is always the potential of a side effect, but there is also risk in a car accident on your way to work, and generally that risk is much higher.
0/0	That is the numbers they will admit-it is definitely MUCH higher, and many of those died within a couple of hours of vaccination AND STILL NONE LINK THE DEATH TO THE VACCINE. This guy is nothing but a vaccine shill-his advice will surely get people killed. Any doctor etc promoting this toxic crap should be banned from practice. Its murder, plain and simple.
0/0	That is the problem. Any death induced by vaccine will be shown as unrelated death on papers. U dont take a chance with life like this. It is not russian roulette. Authorities should be careful and approve vaccines only after proper trials and not under political pressure
0/0	That is until they fine you for refusing or decide not to serve you. I can't afford that :( It's masks today, vaccines tomorrow. We are royally fucked.
0/0	That is who committed the murder, their poison
1/1	That is with ANY medication! Someone is bound to be allergic to or have a reaction to ANYTHING!! Food, medication, perfume etc! The majority are fine!
1/1	That isn't true, maybe the vaccine was rushed but that they would give an another disease to it's people is just dumb, we're in a middle of a pandemic. Causing an another one won't be beneficial.
1/-1	That lady saying she got into researching vaccines because her kid was immunodeficient. Aren‚Äôt we telling people to vaccinate their kids because we want to protect those immunodeficient people and people who might have allergies to chemicals in the vaccines?
1/1	That makes me very happy. I was getting depressed thinking the vaccine may not work on the new variants. Science comes through again!!! Please let this be over
1/1	That means, Coronavirus will end soon!
1/1	That might be a good idea! Why have they waited this long?
0/0	That much side effect? Not taking it!
0/0	That vaccine is not safe my dear people do not let them inject you .it is an experimental vacine that will destroy ur lives....pls take heed our God is the biggest protection.
0/-1	That vaccine is the mark of the beast believe it or not.
0/0	That vaccine we know is a mark of the beast,we better die of corona than going to hell
0/1	That was one amazing B12 shot
0/0	That was the point of the vaccine, get rid of the old people.
1/-1	That would be absolutely fine, fantastic deal. Nearly 100% survival rate and doesn't make the majority of people bedridden like other flus. As a matter of fact, you need a test forced upon you to see if you have it. Give me the papers, I'll be the first to sign.
1/1	That's a smart announcement - it incentivizes citizens to go get vaccinated, and gives the tourism industry some sort of a timeline for restart so they're not completely left in the dark, like in many other countries.
1/1	That's awesome! One step closer to having an actual vaccine!!
1/1	That's bad. I hope Health Canada approves both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines soon.
1/1	That's concerning. I would not want to get medical care from someone who doesn't want the vaccine. Not just from a Covid perspective, but because I wouldn't trust their judgment.
1/1/1/1	That's good. We really dropped the ball in containing the virus but at least we're doing good on vaccinations.
1/1	That's great, especially considering the infection rate also provided some immunity as well. So, there are two competing immunity processing going on.
1/1	That's her immune response kicking in, it's a good sign that the vaccine is working well for her. Aching for a few days beats the possibility of getting incubated for Covid by a trillion.
1/1	That's incredible. Most vaccines aren't that effective. I believe that's much more effective than even the measles vaccine. And they sprinted a marathon to get this done in record time.
1/-1	That's interesting to know. But the title of your video is miss leading. Please remember that people in the UK will watch this, the Oxford vaccine is a different type.
1/0	That's just classic "your immune system is responding" side effects. Probably less common in older individuals because of their less active immune systems.
0/0	That's just the tip of the iceberg they are not approved safe yet ...it's experimental tell people the real risk ...
0/0	That's me. I want NOTHING to do with coronavirus vaccine
0/0	That's nice. Still not getting one. The one time I got the flu shot is the one time I got the flu. I'm not chancing Covid
0/-1	That's not good
0/0	That's ok, you can give mine to some other sheep. At least until the military knocks on my door to force inject me. But I know, that's "crazy talk" right.
1	That's part of the reason why vaccines exist, to get herd-immunity.
1/1/1	That's really good efficacy for the first generation of usable vaccine. That chart says it all. Guess I am going to take it
0/0	That's still a hard pass.
0/0	That's straight up bullshit. Getting a vaccine that isn't FDA approved and having no idea what the long term side effects can be is way scarier than a sickness that has a 99% survival rate. I'll stick with my own immune system and sit back and watch the guinna pigs for a couple of years...
1/-1	That's the reaction I get from the mundane flu shot. I think it's more of a physical reaction to getting your arm jabbed through the muscle with a sharp piece of metal, than any biological or chemical reaction to the needle's contents.
1/1	That's their choice. Get the vaccine and protect yourself. Whoever chooses not to can live with the risk.
0/0	That's why vaxxers always say "I was VAcciNAteD and iM FiNe" and all of us who have actually looked into the vacines laugh and laugh
1/-1/1	That's why you make it mandatory.
0/-1	Thats a whole lotta trust issues
0/0/0/0/0	Thats alright ill take my chances of catching covid
1/1	Thats great news! I cant wait to get mine.
0/0	Thats one way they can reduce the population to half a billion.
1/1	Thats the other joke. Its all on the little white leaflet no-one reads. Its hardly a conspiracy! Medicines have side effects because they have effects. The only "medicine" with no side effects is homeopathy. Tap water doesn't cause allergies. Unfortunately it offers no protection against viruses either.
0/0	That‚Äôll be the Nano technology in your system changing your DNA bruv. good luck to you
0/0	That‚Äôs I don‚Äôt take vaccines or my kids they lie too much
0/0	That‚Äôs a definite NO from me!
1/1	That‚Äôs a scientific miracle!!!BRAVOO!
1/1	That‚Äôs amazing I am glad all the frontline people are getting the vaccine. Thank you for helping us.
0/0	That‚Äôs awesome!! Did y‚Äôall figure out what side affects it will cause years down the road! :D oh ya of course you didn‚Äôt....ya just start stabbing everyone with this crap!
0/0	That‚Äôs exactly my reasoning. I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one
0/-1	That‚Äôs exactly my reasoning. I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one. Thankfully I probably won‚Äôt have to either since I live in Taiwan and things are fine here
0/0	That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking like I just want to wait to for more testing until I take it
1/-1	That‚Äôs fine as long as you don‚Äôt infect others if you get the virus were you vaccinated as a child or have you ever taken illegal drugs what do they contain
1/1	That‚Äôs fine, let them indulge themselves in their own stupidity. More vaccines for the rest of us
1/1	That‚Äôs fine, my family will be safe and all the dumbasses will get sick or die
0/0	That‚Äôs funny, these people, they don‚Äôt know if and how this treatment works. Lets mind wash the kids to help us spread the narrative. How CCP is that???
0/0	That‚Äôs gonna be a no for me dawg
1/1	That‚Äôs good news. We may see the end of this pandemic soon. #GetVaccinated
0/0	That‚Äôs good you can give my vaccine to someone else because I am not having it
1/1	That‚Äôs obvious bullshit. mRNA vaccines are safe and effective and unless you are enjoying the pandemic, you should get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.
1/0	That‚Äôs one of my concerns. If this vaccine won‚Äôt give you long term immunity, what good will it be and how close are they to finding this out without exposing the test subject to actual active Covid?
1/1	That‚Äôs relieving to hear. Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated.
1/1	That‚Äôs relieving to hear. Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated. At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said ‚ÄúThe mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can‚Äôt be pro life and pro vax at the same time.‚Äù A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/-1	That‚Äôs so frustrating to hear. Everyone around me is antsy to get the vaccine. It‚Äôs hard that so much supply is held up on 1A
1/1	That‚Äôs what I do. As someone fully vaccinated I plan on returning to normal life. I got the vaccine because my line of work exposes me to a lot of people (air travel). You‚Äôd be concerned and surprised at the number of people however who have no intentions on getting the vaccine and have no intentions on masking or social distancing. Covid just doesn‚Äôt exist in their world
1/1	That‚Äôs what being anti science does to you... it rots your brain!
1/1	That‚Äôs what is happening here, giving vaccines to people who really need it
0/0	That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt won‚Äôt it l had covid and survived without the vaccine
1/1	That‚Äôs why I fully support businesses requiring vaccines for both employees and customers. It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated ‚Äî but don‚Äôt expect to participate fully in society.
0/0	That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt trust that vaccine. If they want to withhold initial side effects information, what are they not telling about that rapidly developed vaccine
1/-1	The "EBOLA" vaccine is for only one strain and clinical studies have yet to be conducted.
0/0	The "vaccine" has absolutely NOTHING to do with the imaginary virus. It is all about the Khazar New World Order tyranny. It is one stage of the mark of the beast.
0/0	The "vaccine" is a hodgepodge of nasty shit pumped directly into your tissues to bring down your immune system so that the next thing that comes around will kill you.
0/0	The "vaccine" isn't one. Do some research before you choose. Why are loads of front line workers refusing to get it.
0/0	The "vaccines" are NOT "vaccines" but rather gene therapy, which has never been used before. They brand new technology and have not undergone Phase 3 clinical trials and is not approved by the FDA. It is impossible to say they are "safe and effective." Already, severe side effects and deaths reported to the VAERS (vaccine adverse events reporting system are well over 15,000, and it is estimated only 1% of adverse events are even reported.
0/0	The 'experts' have been bought off. This is NOT a vaccine, it is a barely untested dna altering operating system. The 'news' has a lot to answer for.
1/1	The 1st vaccine is better than none until the best is found.
0/0	The 40-year-old man in AstraZeneca's developed acute neuro encephalopathy. Before that incident, a trial volunteer developed symptoms of transverse myelitis. It's a rare debilitating neurological disorder linked to vaccines. In September, a trial paused after another participant in the U.K. got the same symptoms. In October, a participant in Brazil died. What's more shocking is that MHRA expects people to suffer from COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	The AstraZeneca vaccine is based on very well known, proven and trusted vaccine that just has been adapted to SARS-CoV-2. Don‚Äôt believe in what the media tells. The vaccine works properly fine.
1	The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is actually a viral vector vaccine. It is a DNA virus, but it is pretty different from an actual DNA vaccine.
0/0	The Astrazeneca jab killed my twin brother , everyone has to make their own decision whether to take it or not I certainly won't now but had planned to.
1/1/1	The Australian TGA said before tacking the vaccine shot, you have to have a vegemite sandwich and a glass of Australia wine, you can place your order on their website,
0/0	The CDC should be renamed the CPC (centers for population control)
0/0	The CDC, as of March 8, 2021, reports 1,637 deaths from the Covid-19 vaccine, and Dr. Cambell is not concerned about this? WOW!!! I have no words.
0/0	The CEO of Pfizer doesn‚Äôt even want to take the vaccine. He even sold about 60% of his own stock lol
0/0	The CEO of Phizer said he doesn't want the vaccine because he "doesn't want to cut the line" That should be all you need.
0/0	The CEO of the pharmaceutical company that received a hundred-million-dollar boost is going to say yeah 90% effective for sure And hey everybody knows they can't be sued
0/0	The COVID vaccines I would never take or give to my family
0/0	The COVID vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection; they lessen symptoms just like taking vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc.
1/1	The COVID vaccines that are available fit the profile of vaccines that are generally safe during pregnancy
0/0	The COVID-19 Vaccination contains a severe problem along with it. See, COVID-19 Vaccination contains the Mark of the Beast. Why folks go on and on about whether or not taking the Vaccine will do good... the answer is: only if you desire life in Hell.
0/0	The COVID-19 pandemic can be eradicated without vaccination.
1/-1	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread suffering. In order to alleviate these harms, it is critical that a solution be found to the pandemic as quickly as possible.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting the virus.
1/-1	The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca showed 76% efficacy against symptomatic infection for three months after a single dose, with greater effectiveness when a second is given later, according to a study.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people who are actively being treated for cancer
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, a group in which the risk of severe COVID-19 is substantial,
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine, when it exists, will be one of the ones that both I and my doctor consider absolutely necessary.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccines are not only safe, they're life-saving. Trust the experts, trust your community, and trust the one million people who have already had it. When your time comes, take the vaccine. @SGadiLondon
1/-1	The COVID19 pandemic has made me realized we‚Äôve been living under a mental health pandemic for a long time.
0/-1	The Chinese virus is a joke! No more deadly than the common flu!
0/-1	The Covid "vaccine" is not a vaccine in the traditional sense.
1/1	The Covid Vaccine Challenge. Make getting the vaccine go viral.
1/1	The Covid Vaccine has undergone rigorous tests that are globally recognised as having the highest safety standard.
1/1	The Covid vaccines are usually safe for most
0/1	The Covid was intentionally put out to depopulate us. Next they are going to hire thugs to cause riots, and cause a civil war. Open your eyes people. Biden is in bed. With China. They are trying to institute a new world order, and turn us into communists. The first step in communism is censorship.
0/0	The Covid-19 Vaccine is going to turn into the new flu vaccine, except your going to be taking both and they still won't work.
1/1	The Covid-19 vaccine are safe. The second shot can make you feel like you have a 24 hour bug but then you're fine.
1/1	The Covid19 vaccine is excellent. In a family of 5 where one of the member got both doses and was exposed to the virus 25 days after getting the 2nd dose. All the family tested positive except for the vaccinated member.
1/1	The Danish Health Authority said studies had shown a higher than expected frequency of blood clots following doses, affecting about one in 40,000 people
1/-1	The Dr. Are taking it, so if you don't want to take it's find, but stop scarring everybody.
0/-1	The EU have dug a great big hole for themselves. Their incompetence is astounding, so no wonder this federal organisation is hated. Read the article in Spiegel International about VDL and the EU's incompetence and get yourself educated.
1/1	The Earth is not flat. Covid is not a hoax. Vaccine works. Pass it on.
0/0	The Entire history of vaccines show that MOST problems and dangers come 2 years later..
0/-1	The FDA says common side effects, in Pfizer's clinical trial involving some 44,000 people, included pain where they got the shot, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, and joint and muscle pain.
1	The FDA says its OK so I think it is
1/1	The FDA would have carried out a thorough review of data from clinical trials. The stats speak for themselves. Prevents 100% serious illness. For all those who have misgivings from taking the vaccine just do it. You have nothing to lose. You have everything to lose by not taking it. I know how nasty this illness can be. Struggling to breathe is no fun, in fact, it's absolutely terrifying. #Jabup!
1/0	The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has announced it has approved a herbal medicine - Cryptolepis sanguinolenta - locally known as Nibima for clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, after a "detailed assessment".
1/1	The French have discredited a perfectly good vaccine....You reap what you sew.
1/-1	The Gamaleya vaccine is based on the same tech as AstraZeneca. It should expectedly have a similar efficacy and side effects as the latter.
0/0	The Government can take my vaccines. I'll be generous and donate it to them.
0/-1	The Great Reset or do they mean the great culling don't forget your vaccine folks. OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE. (These pricks will kill you.) If we cannot see the big picture by now (agenda21) what hope have we got? Good luck everyone.
0	The Guardian doing its part to push the Vaccine agenda.
1/-1/1	The J&J vaccine is a one-dose jab compared to the AstraZeneca which requires two doses, so why not roll out the J&J if its quality and risks are no different to the AZ vaccine?
1/1	The J&J vaccine is the one I got , it‚Äôs been a week and nothing happened.
0/0	The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine must not be used until all issues are corrected If just a few get suck or die it must not be used unless a person is tested for reactions There are other vaccines now Use them!! We know they are safe !
0/-1	The Johnson and Johnson shot should be pulled from the market. There are more cases than this and you should report the truth!!!
0/-1	The Kennedys' are against vaccines, the elite are avoiding it, so should you.
0/0	The Large drug companies are already asking for indemnity against prosecution against future unintended side effects of any C19 vaccine , very confidence inspiring that is !
1/1	The Leader in Canada announced that Pfizer's vaccine is coming and it will be Free to all Canadians. Love my country.
0/0	The MRNA covid19 vaccine contains Nanobots (see Neuralink & bitchute. com). There are concerns of sterilisation. Bill gates plan is depopulation. Please be AWAKE
0/0	The Measles Vaccine killed my whole family and offspring
0/-1	The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency(MHRA) regulates medicines in the U.K. MHRA excepts that the will be many COVID-19 vaccine side effects. The organization posted a bid for an A.I system to track the expected flood of COVID-19 vaccine injuries. MHRA said that: The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) software tool to process the expected high volume of COVID-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs' reaction text are missed
0/0	The Moderna and Pfizer Vaccines are Bill Gates/Dr Fauci scams. In Florida hundreds of old people are dying after getting their jab. I refuse to take it. I will wait for the data just like the 70% of the Hospital personnel are doing.
0/0	The Moderna vaccine has ruined my life. My period is not ending, and I am anemic. My period has been non stop for two weeks now and its been making me very sick. I got my first shot on the 2nd of this month, and ever since then I have had a heavy period. It is not stopping. I am miserable and I am terrified its going to end up killing me.
1/1	The NHS has approved it. Health Canada has approved it. My brother and his girlfriend are both scientists (they don‚Äôt study in vaccines specifically but there both super smart and do their research) and there both gonna get the vaccine. That‚Äôs good enough for me.
1/1	The National Drug Authority as part of their achievements has closed more than 600 unlicensed health facilities and impounded medicines from unqualified personnel and poorly kept places following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
0/-1	The Netherlands suspends the use of Oxford-AstraZeneca as a precaution
1/1	The New Zealand data showed that the most commonly reported reasons to get vaccinated were to protect family and self, with safety being the chief concern about the vaccine.
1/1	The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine already had its 3rd trial which supports its positive results elsewhere in the World..why hasn't the FDA given emergency approval for this vaccine as they have Pfizer & Moderna????
1/1	The Oxford vaccine accidently discovered that a half dose followed by a full dose gave 90% immunity. I wonder whether two half doses could do the same or even create higher immunity still. If this were the case it would release more of the vaccine for global use and reduce the reaction caused from the vaccination Qantas has announced it will only carry those who are vaccinated - good news
1/1	The Oxford vaccine was built off of MERS and SARS research, if you've got even a bit of a pre-existing template to work with then it's not going to take years.
0/0	The People dont need vaccine. Its a microchip in The vaccine. We are not dogs. And We are not WHO slaves.
1/1	The Pfeizer vaccine works - its relatively simple. Just need the new variants RNA to produce and can be quickly turned around
1	The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are extremely safe, with some mild expected side effects, says the UK's drugs regulator
1/1	The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines are very safe, but I'm wondering what country you are in where you can be young enough that your parents can force you to be vaccinated, but old enough that the vaccine has both been authorized and is available in your age group.
1/1	The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been given to around 30,000 people with no reported problems. The vaccine technology they use has been used in cats for more than ten years. No treatment is ever 100% safe but it seems conclusive that taking the vaccine is safer than not taking the vaccine.
1	The Pfizer vaccine bus hit about 20 hours after my second shot. The fatigue is no joke. Don‚Äôt make plans after your shot. But I am so grateful my body is building immunity. #vaccine @pfizer
0/0	The Pfizer vaccine is killing of the elderly, as expected, but WHAT will it do to the young?? when their turn comes. Are we in the UK hearing the truth.???
0/-1	The Pharmaceutical companies are so happy.
0/1	The Queen is old, Boris Johnson is old, they should have got the vaccine first.

1/1	The Sputnik V vaccine, developed in Russia, has been shown to be 91.6% effective against the coronavirus, according to a new peer-reviewed analysis in the medical journal The Lancet.
0/0	The States who's people have received these COVID shots. Strangely have the the most current COVID cases .
1/1	The U.K. has already vaccinated more people than the 27 members of the EU combined. Thank god we voted for Brexit.
0/-1	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the most common side effects of the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are:injection site pain and swelling, fatigue, headache, chills and fever
1/1	The UK government have decided to increase the time adminstered between the 1st and 2nd doses, instead relying on a slightly less efficacy rate of the 1st dose, but to cover a much wider population. This plan in different to many other countries but studies suggest this approach should pay off. The 1st graph only takes into account countries who have admininstered BOTH does, and therefore doesnt quite give the wider picture to reflect the UK's approach. The UK adminstered 600,000 doeses on a single day over the weekend.
1/1	The UK vaccination program is probably the only thing the government had done well during this pandemic. If the numbers continue the way that they are going, the 15 million people in the top four most vulnerable groups will be vaccinated a week before schedule.
0/-1	The US Rollout hasnt been smooth. Me a Canadian: You guys are getting vaccines?
1/1	The US should move to immediately approve this vaccine. The EU and UK have, these aren't 3rd world countries. They don't know anything the US doesn't.
1/1	The USA should be proud of how well their vaccinations are going. In my 2nd country Germany, the estimated date when all adults are eligible for vaccinations is in September! In US it‚Äôs the 19th of April! Just great management by our great government.
0/0	The V is pure poison!!! This guy must work for the pharmaceutical companies!!!
1/1	The Vaccine Isn‚Äôt Mean, It Will Keep Your Cells Clean!

0/0	The Vaccine will Really Mess you Up!
0/0	The Vaccines are the real virus!
0/0	The WHO hasn't approved it!
1/1	The actual dataset shows a 1:2.5M chance of blood clotting from the AstraZeneca vaccine. There is a similar risk from the J&J vaccine. A 1:1M chance from the Pfizer vaccine is also present. To put this blood clotting risk into context, the MMR vaccine that is given standard to children across the world comes with a 1:100,000 risk of blood clot. It's considered an insignificant risk at that number but AstraZeneca is being chucked out? To put that further into context, it means in a country with 65M people as France has you'd see just 26 people develop blood clots, most of which would not be fatal. Now compare that to the 98,750 CoVID-19 deaths France has experienced... But see what the EU have done is thrown out the British Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and replace it with the functionally identical J&J vaccine that has the same chance of blood clotting. Because this totally isn't political...right?
1/1	The adenoviruses are weakened so they cannot replicate in humans and cannot cause disease
0/0	The amount of Money spent on the fake tests and unnecessary vaccines would be more useful if used to give children all around the world food,
1/1	The amount of anti-vax and anti-quarantine sentiment I see getting lots of likes in YouTube comments on other videos concerns me. People don't understand that the reason media hypes it up is because the younger population often go symptomless when they carry covid-19 and then they think people are overreacting. The reality is that the wreckless symptomless carriers can directly or indirectly spread the virus to vulnerable populations that show symptoms (i.e. the elderly) and that is the problem. On top of this, anti-vaxxers claim the vaccine is a death sentence despite deaths caused after vaccination being extremely low*. The vaccine is safe and particularly in younger individuals, there are side effects that appear after the second dose such as headache, fever, and muscle aches**.
1/1	The amount of people commenting negativity about the vaccine killing them are the same people who eat chips, cake and drink coke for breakfast, binge drink alcohol and other drugs I‚Äôm sure.
1/1	The amount of people commenting negativity about the vaccine killing them are the same people who eat chips, cake and drink coke for breakfast, binge drink alcohol and other drugs I‚Äôm sure. What I‚Äôm trying to say in so many words is if you‚Äôre going to be a stickler about what‚Äôs going on your body make sure you‚Äôre being fair about the things that‚Äôll end up killing you 20 years from now!
1/-1	The amount of people commenting on this that have no idea what they are talking about is baffling.
0/0	The answer is no and anyone who tries to force it on me I will fight them to the death it is that simple
0/0	The answer is no and anyone who tries to force it on me I will fight them to the death it is that simple .
1/1	The answer is yes, because your immune system needs to know how to combat the virus, and vaccines are safer than actually going around getting a potentially deadly disease to strengthen your immune system, not to mention it is very easy for the layman to misinterpret information and see: "Oh, aluminum in vaccines? That's a metal, therefore bad." Instead of actually understanding what these ingredients accomplish and how safe they are
0/0	The answer is ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. I will wait, until there is a sufficient proof that the vaccine is not harmful, because tinkering with one‚Äôs immune system can go horribly wrong.
1/1	The anti vaxx meme has lasted longer than the the anti vaxx kids
0/0	The benefit is you get to be a test subject! Hooray science!
1/1	The benefit of getting the vaccine is high
0/0	The benefits of no vaccine outweighs its side effects. They could have used blood serum vaccines like they used to, and not for the thousands of dollars per dose. The pharmaceutical companies want to play with our mRNA
0/0	The benefits of these injections outweigh the risks....NOT.
1/0	The benefits out weigh the risks surly that means it's unsafe then.

1/1	The best is the COVID vaccine is effective and safe, while some of the side effects do need more time to be seen. Hope everyone stays safe during this pandemic.
1/1	The best thing is after I‚Äôve had my vaccine, if I become asymptotic and pass it it on to one of those anti-Vaxers who end up dead, I‚Äôll sleep just fine
1/1	The best vaccine is the one in your arm. I'd happily have any I'm offered.
1/1	The best vaccine is whatever one you can get your hands on. Each person vaccinated makes it more difficult for the virus to spread which is a necessary component for it's survival.
0/-1	The big question is what are the side effects
0/1/1	The bigger angle is that this is a bad day for confidence in vaccines, and that‚Äôs bad for everyone.

1/1	The blood clot issue of AstraZeneca is 5 in a million. Covid related deaths are 20,000 in a million. India is reporting 1000+ deaths everyday. Please do not spread such messages and discourage people from taking the jab. It is important for everyone in India to get vaccinated

0/0	The broad application of experimental mRNA transfections against SARS-CoV-2 is a violation of the Nuremberg Code.
0/0	The censorship on the facts are so obvious that yt will not even allow scientific information to be posted. Have you heard of CRISPR Cas9 used in the mRNA vaccines? Go view articles on it pre cv and you will see it's a gene editing tool that actually be used to modify your dna.
1/1	The chance of having a bad reaction involving blood clots was less than 1 in a million.... and unvaccinated against COVID.. the chances of eventually catching it are far higher..
1/1	The child-survival-rate has drastically increased after the invention of vaccines. Every child that dies from measels is a child that could have lived a long and happy life, if the person that infected them would have been vaccinated.
1/-1	The clear truth is they could have done this months ago, but people were not worth minimal business risk.
0/0	The clinical trials that were suppose to run for 3 years were cut short at 6 months and they got emergency use authorization. And as she said, the trials now continue in you the reciepient. So if you want to be a lab rat, go for it. I will wait for 2 years.
1/1	The clinics are full of people getting vaccinated, but there are very few people in the hospitals with complications.
1/1	The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC recommendations to protect yourself and others provides the best protection from COVID-19.
1/1	The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC‚Äôs recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19
1/1/1	The comments here are a dumpster fire (2020 style) of anti-vaxxers. Science people, can we listen to science for a moment?
1/-1	The comments here are broken and indecipherable. Yet these people get through day-to-day life somehow?
1/-1	The comments on this video make me lose faith in the future of this country.
0/0	The companies have blown up the clinical trials by vaccinating placebo subjects. The side effect reporting system is overwhelmed. The preclinical work was done in weeks. The technology was considered experimental until last year. You tell me how we know the vaccines are safe.
0/-1	The companies have more immunity than the people taking the vaccine.
1/0	The companies that make vaccines mandatory are the companies that I will patronize.

1/1	The concept of these vaccines have been in the work since SARS was around, so the argument that these vaccines were rushed with no planning whatsoever isn‚Äôt accurate.
0/0	The concern is also that the vaccine was rushed
0/0	The covid 19 vaccines are killing and maming people this is a fact! How about telling people they may expect death or disability after their vaccineü§îüêëüíâ‚ò†
0/-1/0	The covid mutation is far more rapid than the vaccination.
0/0	The covid vaccine has me worried. Another Government mistake. It hasn't been tested thoroughly so it won't be going in my arm
1/1	The covid vaccine hasn‚Äôt killed a single person. NOT taking the vaccine has killed more americans than the second world war.
0/0/0	The covid vaccine is like the flu vaccine. it doesn't stop you from getting it, it just possibly makes the symptoms worse. Also doctors don't know everything, I've had multiple issues doctors couldn't fix but NAET did.
0/0	The covid vaccine is not a vaccine but an insidious method of genetic manipulation. If "gene therapy" sounds scary to you, it should.
0/0	The covid vaccine is the ultimate IQ test. If your stupid enough to take the vaccine, your removed from the gene pool. If your brain and instincts are working and refuse the injected poison, you live to fight another day. It's that simple folks.
1/1	The covid vaccine will save us, it's for our safety and to ensure others are safe too. If you don't want to be vaccined because it may kill you think of others that might be affected by your disease. But there is one disease that is highly contagious and I believe you have it miss it's called stupidity

0/0/0/0/0	The covid vaccines are "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. "Authorized for Emergency Use" is not the same thing as "Approved". Dr. Crotty uses the word "approved." The vaccine roll-out is an on-going study not yet "approved" by FDA.

1/1	The covid-19 vaccines that have been approved have undergone the same thorough safety checks as other vaccines. Large groups of people have received the vaccine and the effects and side effects have been studied.

0/0	The death jab
1/1	The death rates became lower in England and America after the vaccine. We should do the same.
1/1	The deniers are responsible for many deaths. I will get the vaccine as soon as possible
1/1	The development of this vaccine has been going since the first SARS outbreak. What went quickly now was just shaping it to fit this current virus and then getting it licensed in that form. They're neither new nor less safety-tested vaccines than others. The occasional flu-like symptoms after any vaccination are just the immune system jumping on it and getting to work. That's uncomfortable, but not dangerous. The best argument for it though: What else is there? We have no other option. If we want our lives back, vaccines are the only way to go. Vaccinate everyone, as fast as possible. There is no other way out of this mess. I want to meet friends without first getting my brain swabbed with a toilet brush (some of the tests don't feel good, I'll take the vaccination side effects for a few days over the constant testing). I want to stop worrying about killing my co-workers by accident. I want to sit down with someone and have a pizza, you know, the small joys in life. Or go groceries shopping without feeling like I really shouldn't. It's been a year, please, everyone who can get a vaccine already, no matter which, please get it. I'm way at the end of the list (too young, not ill enough, already had the plague once) I can only go out with a good conscience when everyone is safe.
0/0	The devil is not gona pass he use his puppets to kills us with this vaccine.let the world leaders of all countries take it 1st
1/1	The doctors and nurses and the team should all get a medal well done
0/0	The doctors will all tell you that their pharma drugs are safe. I was never told about the side effects before I received a hydrocortisone injection. You know what followed? Extreme muscular weakness, I became too weak to even ride a bike. Non-stop pain in my bones for months. Pain in my brain. Pressure in my chest and feeling like I was going to have a heart attack. You know what the doctors said? They all told me it was my imagination because "the drug takes 12 hours to leave your body." BS.
1/1	The doctors, nurses, and first responders, should get the vaccine first! Followed by older Americans.
1/-1	The dude did the impossible...He survived until 18 without vaccinated .
0/0	The duration of the effect of the vaccine is unknown. People who get it early might be in risk again after a year or so, and if the rest of the world doesn't have the vaccine by then, then the virus will still be around and able to infect the people who got the vaccine early.
0/0	The effectiveness of the vaccine is uncertain
0/0	The elderly and weaken immune systems are always told to get flu shots. These are also the ones attacked most by Covid. Could there be a link? They were pushing flu shots before the Covid broke out.
0/1	The entire process went faster than usual for explainable reasons
1/1	The entire process went faster than usual for explainable reasons, but still followed the usual steps for testing and review. There is no risk with the vaccine ‚Ä¶
0/0	The entire vaccination programme should be halted now. People are maimed and dying. They were healthy prior to being vaccinated.
0/0	The entire vaccine machine is built on lies of omission and fraudulent science.. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS quietly paid out by NVICP to vaccine injured people, but the overwhelming majority of vaccine injuries are never even REPORTED. OF the thousands reported, only a tiny few are compensated. therefore, the real numbers of dollars that should have been paid out to vaccine injured people is in the TRILLIONS.

1/1	The fact that scientists have managed to produce several highly effective vaccines in such a short time period is astounding.We are lucky to have it available soon. I will take it first chance I get. That anyone would hesitate getting it is incomprehensible.
0/0	The fact that they've developed a vaccine within a year is a curse and not a miracle, old boy.
1/1	The fact that we are all waiting on 1 or 2 vaccine manufacturing places to crank out vaccines is ridiculous. They should have had 10 of these spun up and ready to go.

0/0	The fact they want to vaccinate every person on the planet proves this has nothing to do with COVID. A virus with a 99.9% recovery rate doesn‚Äôt call for worldwide vaccination on this scale. So what‚Äôs in these vaccines that‚Äôs so important they want everyone to have one?
0/0	The facts are that: 1. The MelesiaAirliness plane shot down over Ukraine was aimed at scientists who were to present a plan for depopulation of the population and parts in Sydney !!! 2.5G + virus vaccine will add height. Torsion, morphogenetic fields can insert, remove ports into or from the aid genome by means of ninformation fields and the pcr polymerase chain reaction. Prof. Luc Montegnier, who discovered HIV portions with the Boleria burgdorferi genome. 3. Bill Clinton said that there are too many people and we should be around 1 billion, Gates says there should be 500 million. Please check the interviews with them. 5. Warming of the external climate - drought and lack of food. 6. Please check why 2.3 million women in Africa are infertile after tetanus vaccination !!!! 7. Please check or exploit from monkeys implanted in the US. This virus wakes up after 40 years causing disease. 8. If flu is a matting virus, why has there been no effective vaccine for it for years? Why don't they vaccinate people who are severely vaccinated
0/0	The fake "vaccine" does exactly what it was designed to do. Virtually all sane people know that COVID-19 is a hoax perpetrated by the Jew World Order.
0	The false security of vaccines is the cause of the fourth wave we are now experiencing.
0/0	The famous baseball player Hank Aaron died 2 weeks after taking the vaccine. He had No medical issues.
1	The faster we get 75% of this country vaccinated, the faster we end COVID and the sooner everything returns to normal
0/0	The fastest created vaccine in history? Hmm smth stinks like the ones who created the virus are also curing it
0/0	The fatality rate of the vaccine looks to overtake covid, in healthy people nonetheless.
0/0	The fda website says they don‚Äôt know if the vaccine will be effective much past three months nor whether it prevents transmission... but yet everyone is convinced this will make the world a safer place. we are now living in the age of the great Nazi cult. I am quickly losing respect for people.
0/0	The federal Government thinks their going to make me get this vaccine. They will be pumped full of lead!!!
0/0	The feeling a lot of us have that the vaccines are dangerous is a guardian angel. Trust your intuition.
0/-1	The few workers naive enough to take the vaccine are not the majority in Sweden, which has basically achieved herd immunity by rejecting economic lockdowns and facemasks.
1/-1	The first challenge is going to be getting 40% of the population to take it after the first 60% who wants vaccines is done being vaccinated.
0/0	The first flu vaccination was 70 years ago. We still have flu today and keep vaccinating. Eventually we will become GMO people with short life.
1/1	The first people who show get the Vaccine (if they want it) not forced, should be the elderly and people at high risk with underlying issues.
0/0	The flu is more dangerous to me, and I don't take the flu shot either. Also because there is next to no risk.
0/0	The flu shot made me sick last time I got one. No vaccines for me.
1/1/-1	The flue shot is only 50% effective.. Least 90% is progress.. I think its positive.. Also after the last year they are better at treating it now
0/-1	The following side effects have also been reported: muscle, and joint pain, delayed swelling, redness or a rash at the injection site
0/0	The fools are the ones taking the vaccine. We don't have any idea what's in it, but if Fauci and WHO recommend it as a way to stop the virus, then for sure, anyone taking the shot is a complete idiot. I'll take my chances. Build up your immune system and you wont get the bug. Simple.
0/0	The frail and elderly were not included in these vaccine trials. IMO, giving it to them now is MURDER!
1/-1	The full summary of "I use covid 19 to destroy covid 19"
1/1	The future is now thanks to science!
1/1	The globe functions as one whether we agree or not. Neglecting to extend vaccinations to developing countries will not rid the world from this horrendous pandemic...Traveling sums it up. Therefore, get to work.
1/1	The goal of the vaccine is to prevent death and hospitalizations because of Covid.
1/-1	The goal of the vaccines is to prevent you from the death (effectiveness) while minimising you to go to hospital (efficacy
1/1	The goal of vaccination is to make everyone immune to the virus. Vaccination is the final solution and the end of the nightmare of the Covid-19 pandemic
0/0	The good Jesus gave me an immune system.. don‚Äôt need your poison.. keep it
0/0	The good old brainwashing machine is at it again calling the truth lies. Need to question who‚Äôs profiting from the vaccine? The very people pushing it. Human guinea pigs. Please read the ingredients!
1/1	The good thing about this is that most scientists and medical professionals will get the vaccine. These are the people we want around.
0/0	The gov does not care about you.... they only care about money & power.
0/0	The goverment is gonna flick the switch, and everyone will turn in to zombies.
0/0	The government have all of their vaccine eggs in one basket. If vaccines were killing people do you think they will tell you? No!
0/0	The government is really pushing this. It's a hard pass for me.
0/0	The government is running a scam on us. They take the numbers of deaths from cancer, the flu, and other diseases and label them all as covid deaths instead. This way, the death rates seem way up, when in reality, the deaths of this year are the same as last year, and the year before. (Within 15,000 difference). They outlawed known cures such as hydroxizine and fire the doctors who perscribe it. The whole thing's a hoax to initiate the new world order. How we can stop it is by banding together and spreading the word. Stay safe, god bless, do not consent, do not take the vaxx. Also, last i checked these videos had a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 10. They keep resetting the dislikes. Do not be duped into this illusion they expect us to believe.
0/0	The government should just suspend all these nonsense vaccines lot people are recovering now we have less than 80,000 active cases so far
1/1	The government should televise themselves getting the vaccine. That'd be a low cost way to give public more confidence in its safety.
0/0	The government will scam people. They don't care. The side effects are horrible and fatal. My neighbor who was a 85 year old woman died 15 days after covid vaccine. Its sad but this is the truth. It's all about trillions $$$ selling the vaccine not about our lives.
0/0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are gonna stop this pandamic
0/0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are safe and effective
0/1	The group of doctors in Houston that administered Ivermectin presented much data. And a drastic reduction in deaths. Since Ivermectin has been FDA approved for decades and have little to no side effects, why would it hurt to prescribe as a prophylactic? It won‚Äôt hurt. And may very well help.
1/1	The growing anti-vaccination rhetoric is putting us at risk from deadly diseases that should have been eradicated completely in this day and age. No one should have to suffer from a disease that vaccines could safely prevent. No one.
0/0/0	The guy said mRNA have not been relatively used before, actually mRNA vaccines have never been used before covid
0/0	The harder they push the more I resist.
0	The harder you work at trying to change people's minds where this vaccine is concerned the more suspicious of it they are going to become. People's feelings should be respected and we should use plants for medicine not chemicals.
1/1	The harm caused by covid-19 far outweighs any risk from a trialed-vaccine imo
1/0	The health campaign was fine, the problem is too many people these days get sucked into sheep like behaviour without analysing the true situation.
0/0/0	The health department order is for you not to think too much about your personal self preservation against being injected with there poison for the greater good of EXPERTS
1/1	The healthcare system I work for has already vaccinated over 5,900+ employees, providers and vendors out of a roughly 8,000 person workforce. The remaining ones either don‚Äôt want it or are waiting to see how others fare with the vaccines first or they‚Äôre not permitted to get the vaccine due to them having just recovered from COVID. A few weeks ago we had almost 500 employees out with COVID or quarantining due to exposure and just a day ago that number was down to below 100. Our COVID patients went from over 400 at its worst to 285 as of yesterday and this includes patients who have recovered from COVID but are still too sick to get discharged. So yes, vaccines do really work in my opinion.
0/0	The history they feed us is lies, no vaccine is good for you. They are designed to be harmful.
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action. Edit: This is with 75% of employees having received one dose and 65% having received both doses.
1/1	The idea of a link between vaccines and autism has been extensively investigated and conclusively shown to be false
1/-1	The idea was to vaccinate 60-70% of adults by September, the target which will be reached, but then the vaccination became the competition, which will ultimately affect the poor countries the most. The target of 85% is unrealistic simply because of the anti-vax movement. You don't have that amount of people willing to take the vaccine, not to mention they won't let their children taking the one. It's all about making the argument against the EU, and the EU is affected by this, even though they should ignore this.
0/0/0	The immune system was created to handle things like this!
1/1	The incredible rate of discovery and development is testament to what can be achieved through collaboration. It would be incredible post covid (getting ahead of myself) if the same vigorous approach could be applied to other prevalent diseases especially those affecting third world countries.
1/-1	The inferior AZ vaccine and no supply to be had from overseas should prompt Australia to establish its own manufacture of a mRNA vaccine post haste
0/0	The investigation was done by the CDC and Pfizer or the pharmaceuticals is like asking the bank robbers to investigate if they committed the robbery
0/0	The irony is that by taking the ¬´vaccine¬ª you‚Äôre inviting them to do it again
0/0	The jab doesn't stop transmission or make you immune, so what is a point to take it.
0/0	The kill shot
1/1	The known and potential benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine must outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine for use under what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
0/0	The larger point is you don‚Äôt vaccinate people for a virus that kills .002%. Has a 99.997% survival rate. Clearly something else is going on. Clearly the vaccine isn‚Äôt safe.
0/0	The largest medical experiment in the history of mankind. Millions of human lab rats. Truly scary.
0/0	The last time I had a flu vaccine I got really sick. I haven't had one since. Realize the vaccine is for other people so even if it kills you, it protects other people from YOU. I've never had a bad case of the flu until I had a vaccine. I'll wait at least 1 year before taking this one.
0/0	The last time I took a vaccine (against the Mexican Flu back in the day) I got very ill. Who says the same thing won't happen again when I take the vaccine against Covid(not that I don't need it)? As long there is no certainty that the vaccine works, I won't take it...
0/0	The last time I took a vaccine it caused a severe allergic reaction. I could have almost died. I'd rather bet my life on the 'flu' than an untested vaccine put out by large greedy corporations.
0/0	The last time there was a mass vaccination program in the US was the 1976 swine flu outbreak, where the vaccine program had to be stopped after 25% already were vaccinated because it was paralyzing and killing people. Gerald Ford even went on television to take the vaccine and encourage it. Since then, Congress has passed new laws that vaccine companies have no liability to be sued if they produce bad vaccines that kill people. Making the vaccine mandatory is irresponsible considering it‚Äôs already troubled history.
0	The law should change , Force them to take the Vaccine or stay in jail for 5 yrs lol
0/0	The less news I watch, the stronger my immune system gets. :)
1/1	The lesser risk, by far, is to get a COVID vaccine as soon as possible ‚Äì any vaccine. COVID has already killed almost 600,000 Americans, and left millions more with long-lasting injuries. If enough people get vaccinated, the pandemic will end. If people do not get vaccinated, new viral variants will evolve, and the pandemic will continue, year after year, forever. This should not be a difficult decision.
0/0	The lesson is...not to take the vaccine..I got offered it recently and I said no thanks..I'd rather take my chances falling down the stairs
1/1	The level of ignorant, self-important reasons, delusional reasons why people are refusing to take the vaccine is truly appalling. On the other hand, good. Step aside. More vaccine available for the rest of us who look at evidence for decision making. As long those people do not interfere with my ability to get vaccinated hey, go ahead, get sick.
1/1	The light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter!!
1/-1	The likelihood is less than 1%, looking at the numbers they posted. I'd be more worried I'd did in a car accident on my way to the grocery store.
0/0	The list gets longer and longer!!! Who do we sue if we have severe side effects or family and friends die???
0	The long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccines are unknown.
1/-1	The mRNA COVID vaccines are safe, effective and cannot give you COVID.
0/0	The mRNA Vaccine is NOT a "Vaccine". It's a medical device. It will change your DNA forever!
0/0	The mRNA in the vaccine tells the cells to create a protein that stops the fertility of the virus that will effect your fertility also you wont get kids,
1/1	The mRNA ones are the ones being approved now. Looks like they hold by far the most promise
1/1	The mRNA vaccine technology being used here is decades old. We‚Äôve simply adapted it to a new virus. It has been studied enough, you just haven‚Äôt done the studying. The unknown here is the long term effect of getting Covid-19. Fear the disease, not the vaccine.
1/1	The mRNA vaccines cannot alter your DNA. The ingredients of the vaccine do not enter your cell's nucleus, which is where your DNA is stored. Instead, the vaccine simply offers instructions to your cells. Your cells read the instructions, and then they create antibodies against the spike protein found on the SARS-COV-2 virus. The instructions that were sent in the vaccine simply fall apart and disappear.
1/-1	The mRNA vaccines had 100% antibody response. When AstraZeneca was reporting actual numbers the antibody quantities were less and the T-cell response seemed unremarkable. Was not a good day for their stock. Their primate study was not encouraging (Oxford being where the vaccine comes from, I think even going back to SARS, MERS, whatever a similar attempt was let's call it mixed). I think people are being misled, not nefariously but context is lacking. We'll see what the phase 3 results are. I would be shocked if that vaccine is 90% effective and would wonder for how long it would hold up. Maybe it meets a threshold but I wouldn't compare it to the two mRNA vaccines and just expect the same result.
1/0/1	The madlads at Pfizer-BioNTech really are carrying the whole EU vaccination effort without breaking a sweat.
1/1	The magic of science. I‚Äôm hoping that we have finally turned the corner
0/0	The main concern about the COVID-19 vaccines has been among people with a severe allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate
1/-1	The main problem lies in production, but not budget.
0/0	The main reason for not wanting to take it is suspicion that all the safety data is not available, and that the vaccine was rushed to production.
1/1	The main reason you should get vaccinated is to not get seriously ill.
1/1	The majority of mothers regarded vaccinations as an efficient method of children protection against infectious diseases.
0/0	The majority of people don‚Äôt even need the vaccine.
0/-1	The majority will know when they make the vaccine passports mandatory. But then it will be too late. This is all Bible prophecy and cannot be changed. We lose short term - but in the end those with Jesus win. In essence, I know we are fighting a battle we've already lost. Just don't take it no matter what. Even if you have to die. Put all your faith and trust in Jesus. Satan's time is short.
0/0	The makers of the vaccine and the government accept that a small percentage will either be grossly injured by the vaccine or die from it. That is business as usual for them, to lose a few for the "greater" good.
0/0	The mark of the beast
0/0	The mark of the beast. Load up be ready to fight. The supreme court is full of murders and podophiles.
1/0	The media coverage misinformation, government bureaucracy, and peoples' unrealistic expectations and lack of patience based on the logistical difficulties. Please stop telling the general public they can get a covid vaccine at any local pharmacy; let us handle things when we actually secure said product and stop wasting everyones' time giving people false information about where/when people can get covid vaccinations.
1/1	The media in the United States keeps making headlines like "It's only 66% effective!" When in reality, it's 85% effective against severe coronavirus and 100% effective against death and it's been tested against all the new strains.
0/0	The media is so manipulative trying to make it seem like this is the best thing since sliced bread. i‚Äôm not getting this vaccine!
0/0	The media is swinging on J&J nuts. They"re spinning this so much in J&Js favor.
0/0	The media is the entity spreading falsehoods. Brave people like her stand for truth.
1/1	The methodology of how mRNA works is way better and bio-friendly than any other vaccine, regardless the success rates
0/-1	The mid to long term side-effects of this 'vaccine' are entirely unknown. This isn't an opinion. It's a FACT.
1/1	The mild illness caused by the attenuated vaccine is exactly what makes it so effective. This is the closest thing we had to ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù.
1/1	The minute a vaccine's offered, I'm there.
1/0	The moment anti vaxx say vaccines cause autism that's when I plug my ears and compassion goes out the window
1/1	The more important reason is that I consider it a duty to my patients, most of whom are elderly. My temperature gets checked every day that I work, but I‚Äôm young, and there is a chance I could be asymptomatic even if affected. The last thing I would want is to unwittingly infect my patient. It‚Äôs my worst nightmare. Even the thought of it mortifies me.I will get vaccinated at my earliest opportunity.
0/0	The more it (vaccination) is supported by public authorities, the more will its dangers and disadvantages be concealed or denied
0/0	The more lockdown and the more we vaccinate, the more advantage is given to the more dangerous strains and the more this virus population's only chance of survival is to become more infectious and dangerous.
0/-1	The more people that take this poison the faster we rid the worlds of the weak dumb ass sheeple
0/0	The more propaganda I see on the jabs, the more I am digging my heels in. No vax for me and that this rate even when trials finish in 2023 I still won't be having the damn thing. #NoVaccine
1/1	The more that refuse, the more chance my loved ones have at getting one
1	The more the virus spreads and the more people catch it, the more its new strains will come about. Through vaccination, we must prevent the virus from spreading before we have new vaccine-resistant coronavirus mutations. If this ever happens for the first time, we will be in an endless race to develop, test, produce, distribute and apply the vaccine before other dangerous strains appear. And we will always end up losing this inglorious race.
1/1	The more the viruses reproduce, the more mutation there will be. If people would just suck it up and tough it out, the viruses would die out quickly. Unfortunately, having someone's grandma die is less inconvenient than not going out to eat. If only mortality was tied to IQ!
0/0	The more they pressure me to take it the stronger I will say NO
1/0	The more they push the vaccine the less I want to get it. They can keep that. Someone else can have mine.
0/-1	The more you try to force something on anyone the more they become suspicious of it. And the more suspicious they get, the more they reject it
1/1	The more you vaccinate the less people can get it and (probably) spread it. And if you are vaccinated and can show it you have much less to worry about.
0/-1	The morning after vaccine my dad was violently sick for nearly an hour with diorreah, all week he has felt weak, tired, looked grey, didn‚Äôt want food, just water, 1 week on he finally got out of bed and had food.
1/1	The mortality rate of the virus is immensely higher than the incidence of severe complications from the vaccine, and stopping the spread of the virus will prevent many more untimely deaths.
0/1	The most common reactions are headaches, arm pain, body aches, chills or fever lasting a few hours to a few days.
0/-1	The most common symptom of COVID is you feel just fine, and you have to be tested to even know you have it, coupled in with 99% survival rate.
0/0	The most disturbing aspect of all of this is that only yesterday, claiming that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine may not be entirely safe was a violation of YouTube‚Äôs ‚Äúcommunity guidelines‚Äù and could have resulted in an immediate removal.
0/0/0/0/0/0	The most rushed vaccine in human history? You're damn right I'm not getting it.
0/0	The mrna product is not a vax. Does not meet the definition. Cannot be forced or coerced to take any experimental products against ones informed consent.
0/-1	The narcotics drug distributors would have done the better job than the states.
0/0	The negative impact of this so what called "vaccine" is far way more than the positive ones!
0/0	The new world order is upon us
1/1	The newest highlight of my day is seeing people post on social they got the vaccine. Brings a smile to my face, especially when it‚Äôs someone I greatly respect. Awesome for you and your family!
0/-1	The newly discovered COVID-19 vaccine may have side effects.
1/1	The news of the vaccine was a much needed morale boost for the UK, and so far it‚Äôs going to plan.
0/-1	The news reports are forced to lie about a pandemic!
1/-1	The next moment the world has been waiting for! I am crying tears of #joy!!!!
0/0	The non-stop ads for the vaccine state that you need to take it get it so OTHERS will be safe. How is this true if the "vaccine" doesn't prevent your infection (or reinfection), AND icannot prevent the spread of the vaccine to others if you ARE infected??????
1/1	The number 1 reason we are living longer is due to life extending medicines. These are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer. Good luck if you don't plan on taking anything as you age.
0/1	The number of anti-vaxxers is in direct proportion to people who thought the election was fixed....
1/1	The number of doses is not as relevant as when they are available. The Oxford vaccine may be ready in larger quantities before.
0/-1	The number of trial participants for UK/Br listed seems too low per the astrazenica website
0/0	The nurses at the hospital i work at that got the vaccination had to take days off of work from the side effects. Severe headaches, puking, feeling dead and lethargic
0/0	The nurses at the hospital i work at that got the vaccination had to take days off of work from the side effects. Severe headaches, puking, feeling dead and lethargic. I do not take it.
1/1	The odd of dying in a car crash are 1 in 103. Does that mean I don‚Äôt drive? I am more safe in an airplane than a car, yet people avoid planes not cars. I have a better chance of being struck by lightening (1 in 500,000) than I do of dying from any of the COVID #vaccines
0/0	The one Pfizer is producing is not vaccine at all. It alters DNA.
0/0	The one time I agree with anti-vaxxers is now
0/0	The ones getting it will be obliterated. We'll still be standing , because we don't listen to the PRESS. RIP
0/0	The only ability of the vaccines is that it helps spread the virus and does not limit it.
1/1	The only bad thing that vaccines have done is reduce certain diseases to mere distant memories, so people have forgotten how important vaccines are and how horrible those diseases were.
1/1	The only bad vaccine news is that no lab is producing them fast enough.
1/1	The only excuse you should have for not being vaccinated, is if you have a broken immune system or if you are allergic to the vaccine itself
0/0	The only hold up now is to see what big pharma company can make the most money from it. Its all money. They don‚Äôt care about people's lives
0/0	The only immunity here is the manufacturers immunity from lawsuits.
1/-1	The only one getting immunity is Pfizer
0/0/1/0	The only one getting immunity is Pfizer.
0/0/0/1	The only one getting immunity is the manufacturer.
1/1/1	The only one happier than me completing my #CovidVaccine was my vaccinator! Three cheers for the volunteers Smiling face with smiling eyes (And volunteer if you can! We need as many as we can get!)
0/-1	The only problem I have with the vacs. are that the pharma companies were given immunity from prosecution before the people were given immunity from the virus.
1/0	The only protection I need against Covid is a healthy diet, good workouts every day, the love of my family, a shot of mRNA in my arm to build spike proteins, eight hours of sleep, and a fulfilling career. But go ahead sheep, keep getting your microchip ‚Äúvaccines.‚Äù
0/0/0	The only reason I‚Äôm refusing the vaccine... I trust nothing or no one! Period!
1/1	The only reason why it got developed is so fast is because the time that it normally takes was long because of waiting for things to happen like waiting for approval and paperwork to go through, but in this circumstance they didn‚Äôt have to wait for things, because of the importance of the situation. The vaccine process is the same amount of time with any vaccine, just less waiting due to the importance of coronavirus.
1/1	The only reasonable action is to take the vaccine
1/1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose?
1/1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose? When can I assume the people I walk past in the street have had a dose?
1/1	The only side effect after receiving my COVID-19 vaccine is I speak fluent Spanish and I forgot how to drive a car. So my life is changing in new and exciting ways!
1/1	The only symptom I had was fatigued for a day after the 2nd shot of hope!!!
0/0/0/0/0/0	The only thing I know is I don't need or want it.
0/0	The only thing I know is I don't need or want the vaccine.
0/0	The only thing I need to know about their vaccine is I know not to trust these people.
1/1	The only thing flatter than the Earth is an unvaccinated child‚Äôs EKG
1/-1	The only thing that‚Äôs being killed by lockdown is brain cells clearly...
0/-1/0	The only thing this video from this propaganda channel that exploited a child has taught me is to be MORE SKEPTICAL of the vaccine.
0/0	The only thing we have to fear is... the Vax itself
1/-1	The only time having asthma came in clutch. Science is amazing.
1/1	The only vaccine that I refuse to get is the flu vaccine.
1/1	The only vaccine that I refuse to get is the flu vaccine. Even time I get it, I get REALLY sick. My son seems to handle them fine.
0/0	The only way If i'd be sure is if Boris is in front of me and we have a wheel of vaccines, and we spin it, and I choose his Vaccine shot! then I wait 10months and watch his effects. What about Kids after? they may be Effected like before? Breathing issues? Fncking hell man.
1/1	The only way to care of others in this pandemic is to take the vaccine as soon as you get the oppurtunity.
1/1	The only way to end this pandemic is to ensure equitable access to the vaccine for all people in all countries. The US must start sharing surplus COVID-19 vaccines with countries that need these lifesaving doses! We need #VaccineEquity now.
1/1	The only way to stem the surge is through vaccination.
0/0	The only way you're going to vaccinate me is if you kill me and then inject it into my corpse
0/0/0	The only way? Well, it clearly isn't or we'd all be dead by now. We are not. I conclude that a vaccine is not the only way.
0/0	The origin of aborted tainted vaccines will sicken you! Dont believe these numbers! Everythi ng is getting labeled covid! What happened to the flu and other disesases! Bill Gates funded these companies and the chinese! Why would you even consider getting anything from china they gave you the virus!! Did you see the warning from the nurse who now has bells pasley 3 days after gettiing vaccinated? Why are the censoring all doctors and nurses warning people? It take 4-10 yrs to test vaccines! Don't be a guinea pig! Take natural things to boost your immune system!!! Watch before this gets censored and share!
1/1	The other 10% probably live in PA. I'm grateful I've been vaccinated, but we're still hanging out in 1A/1B land.
0/1	The other vaccines being developed will contain weakened or inactive forms of ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù viruses, and substances commonly found in many vaccines.
0/1	The outrage at covid was everyone losing it with- we need to protect our elderly because we're killing people with life threatening illnesses in nursing homes. While locking people up & letting family die alone. Now the vaccine is good, it only kills frail patients.
0	The overall vaccination numbers might look good on the surface, but there is a much darker side to this.
0/0	The pandemic and vaccines are fraud!
1/1	The pandemic isn‚Äôt over. Please #GetVaccinated and #MaskUp a bit longer!
1/1	The pandemic will finally end.
0/1	The parents who choose to infect their kids with spit, pus, etc, do not realise what a vaccine essentially is! Smh!
1/-1	The patient who was fully vaccinated in Feb had no symptoms but tested positive in a routine swab test. All close contacts & 1500 other workers tested negative. This is the vaccine working.
0/0	The people I know that did test positive for Covid said that the normal flu is much worst in terms of symptoms. Don't take this vaccine!
1/-1	The people against the vaccine were definitely not the best selection or representation (though I appreciated Percy very much). I work in healthcare, and in my facility only 65% of staff accepted the Pfizer. Same with my husband, who works at about 5-6 different hospitals. All I‚Äôm saying is, more healthcare workers declined it than media has made it look like, and I would like to hear from those perspectives.
0/0	The people are like the guinea pigs who are being experimented on using clinical trial and error. A few months ago they stopped AZ on seniors. Then it appears they proceeded with a younger age group which now they discovered to be developing cerebral thrombosis due to their strong immune response. Now in this latest report, they want to try it again on ages 60 and above (how sure are you that all of them will have a weaker immune response? Or is it because they are economically expendable?).
1/1	The people in the comments show how uneducated humans really are, i mean comments like "i'd rather bet covid i don't trust the government!" and "No Vaccine for me id rather watch the simpsons they predicted it!". So fuxking stupid it's unreal
1/1	The people who are opposed to vaccines should drink disinfectant, like Trump told them to.
1/1	The people who complain about this just don‚Äôt wanna get the vaccine and don‚Äôt wanna be called out for it. i will take it for sure.

0/0	The pifzer showing severe anaphylaxis and deaths??
1/1	The platform is new but it has been tested in multiple studies on more than 100,000 people at this point. I was in the Moderna study and it had little side effect and have not had COVID despite having some direct exposure to someone who had it. I have heard reluctance on it from some people and am curious about some of the hesitancy around it.
0/0	The point isn‚Äôt to stop transmission, it‚Äôs to inject genetic modification into the system.
1/0	The politicians who claim that the AZ vaccine is unsafe are just politicking. The sad thing is that they are politicking with their people's lives! Shame on them.
1/1	The possibility of serious complications for anyone who gets the virus ‚Äî along with the public health consequences of the pandemic‚Äôs continuing its course ‚Äî are strong reasons in favor of getting vaccinated,
1/1	The power of vaccines is awesome always.
1/1	The prime objective is inoculating the population as fast as possible. Every vaccination benefits the population as a whole. Just get on with it. Don't waste time. If you're offered a vaccine it is your duty to take it. Period.
1/1	The problem is suspicion isn‚Äôt scientific proof. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt have smallpox anymore.
1/1	The problem is the time lost, every day you wait around is hundreds more deaths and more billions lost to lockdowns.
0	The problem is we have millions of illiterate people in India who trust the govt. Gates has already run an HPV trial here 10 years back when hundreds of young girls died. The PM of India himself did not take the AstraZeneca vaccine. He took a local indian company vaccine which was a placebo!!!
1/-1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research.

0/0	The propaganda is so thick now, must be getting worried people will think for themselves about what they put in their own bodies
0/1	The purpose of being vaccinated is to protect one from being infected. That means those that are vaccinated are safe from those that are not, so those not vaccinated do NOT pose a threat. It's not anyone's right to dictate what a person should or shouldn't put into their body whether it be by way of safety, legislation, extortion, intimidation or humiliation period.
1/-1	The purpose of the vaccine is to get cured people‚Ä¶
0/0	The question is why the CEO of Pfizer doesnt want to take the vaccine?üòÑ
0/0	The question no one is asking is, why should trust without question a vaccin made by the company that paid the biggest fine for lying about side effect and not finish clinical test? Putting on the market drugs that cause people to go depress, cause inflammation and promote cancer growth in some patient
1	The question should be ‚Äúwhen are you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù instead of ‚Äúare you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù
1/1	The quickest thing we need to do if we really want to help the American people, is get this economy turned back on ‚Äî get people back to work, get kids back in school, get ourselves some herd immunity, get the vaccine distributed as quick as we can and get the uptake rate up
1/1	The rapid development of the #COVID19 vaccine is nothing short of a modern medical miracle.
1/1	The reaction won‚Äôt be death, which is many people‚Äôs reaction to catching covid!!!
1/1	The real good news in this update isn't the efficacy being a few percentage points higher than previously estimated but confirmation that it is working equally well in the elderly.
1/1/1	The real issue here is people don't understand statistics. Take the worst case scenario, it's like a 1 in 6 million chance you die from the covid vaccine. There's also around a 1 in 100 million chance you die per mile driven. This means the covid vaccine has about the same chance of killing you as driving 15 miles.
1/-1	The real thing is painful. Still have it until the 5th. I did everything right, Type 1 diabetic never went outside. Still got it. It's rough
0/0	The reality is the public has been given no data.
1/1	The really important thing here is that we now have evidence that vaccines can be effective (in this case highly effective) against Covid. This means that we can now look to see good results coming out of other trials, especially those that don‚Äôt require storage at such low temperatures.

0/0	The reason a mouse trap is so effective is because the mouse does not realize why the cheese is free.....
1/1	The reason for this moment I think is the incredibly complex nature of the working of immune system. And people don't understand it cause there is no simple way to make people understand their working to reassure them unless they have medical degree. And people always fear what they don't understand. It's easy to get misguided and misinterpreted the story if you don't understand the whole picture. It's not anti-vaxxers fault it's failure of awareness by government, failure of education
0/-1	The reason that Germany might be having difficulty with the rolling out of both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines might be due to storing it at a cold temperature especially the Pfizer which needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius.
0/0	The recovery rate is 99.9%, so why do we need a vaccine?
0/1	The reporter actually said it perfectly: "This prevailing lack of trust in the government. This isn‚Äôt just a 2021 thing, or a coronavirus vaccine thing. This is a mounting, ever growing, distrust in the government at large.‚Äù
1/1	The research + work to get out this vaccine has been in progress for 17+ years. The goal now, today, is to at least, thru vaccination, minimize the amt. of cases that are bad enough to need hospitalization or lead to death. I am high risk. It'd kill me. Pls. vaccinate.
0/0	The results are scary. Say NO to vaccine
0/0	The risk I will get COVID-19 is too low.
1/0	The risk is as high as bedrock
1/1	The risk of COVID is a bigger concern to me than the risk from the unknown around the vaccine.
1/1	The risk of a bad reaction from the vaccine is low.
1/1	The risk of a live virus vaccine is that you catch covid, which is also the risk you face if you don't get the vaccine. There's no way the vaccine will be approved if the risk is higher for getting the vaccine than it is from contracting it from the community. I don't understand your logic
1/1	The risk of catching COVID through not getting vaccinated is, quite literally, orders of magnitude greater than the risk of developing blood clots from the vaccination. And the public not understanding relative risk and probability sure won‚Äôt help with vaccine hesitancy.
1/0	The risk of death crossing the street is much greater than it is from taking the vaccine. "Abundance of caution" my ass.
1/1	The risk of getting a blood clot is from: 16.5% from COVID 0.18% from smoking 0.05% to 0.12% from birth control pill 0.0004% from AstraZeneca vaccine
1/0	The risks of adverse effects from catching COVID are much more severe and certain.
0/0	The rush to test an experimental biological agent (mRNA vaccine) on our first responders and military should have you very concerned.

1/1	The sad part is, they put their kids and other at risk, but these antivaxxer parents are from generations, who were all vaccinated as babies..
0/0	The safest way to protect from Covid is nutrition and lifestyle, not an experiment gene therapy Frankenstein jab.

0/0/0	The same people who have recalled on meds.. also are the ones that said it was safe.
1/1	The same way different people react differently to the same medication, different people react differently to the same vaccination. ‚Å£ Don't hesitate to take it at all!
0/0	The saying goes ‚Äú if ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix ‚Äú never had the flu jab either, nobody‚Äôs injecting me with something I know nothing about
0	The scariest vaccine on earth.
1/1	The science is absolutely incredible. But, how much in body testing is there? So cool that research has been in progress for so long to help stop the current pandemic. I will get it but I would rather be one of the later ones (I'm not at risk nor am I around anyone who is).
0/1	The science is great and vaccines are probably the greatest thing ever. The problem is instead of a multi year (5-10) clinical trial like normal vaccines go through, this brand new vaccine, using version 1 technology, was rushed through in 9 months. I'll wait. Thanks
1/1	The science of mRNA vaccines has been around for 20 years. They tweaked it for covid 19 but it is not new science. So, if you want things to go back to normal, wear a mask and get vaccinated.
1/1	The scientific community always impresses me at their hard work, even with the crazy high demand and the short amount of time.
0/0	The scientists have no cure for aids virus and flu virus and yet they came up with this vaccine in 6 months ?And after taking this vaccine if people still have to wear masks and there will still be shutdowns then whats the fkn point ?
1/1	The scientists woked hard in making a medicine to make this Corona virus go away. And I believe in them.
1/1	The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive to cover the frontline Corona warriors will begin today in Gujarat.
1/1	The second shot was definitely worse but I'd rather deal with minor side-effects than dying on a respirator.
0/-1	The sheep lining up like brainwashed idiots. A vaccine for a virus with over 99.9 % chance of survival. A virus so dangerous you have to get tested to know you have it. A vaccine so safe that soon it will be a requirement in order for you to work, travel, go to school, etc. What a joke.
0/0	The sheep will still take it to please the government and MSM.
1/0	The sheeple will believe any rubbish without any evidence, the bigger the lie the more ppl believe it " Adolf Hitler " https://youtu.be/56tA0YlWkXg

0/0	The shot must don't work if she had it the vaccine why does she need to wear a mask üò∑
1/0	The side affects may include being amune to covid 19
1/1	The side affects of vaccines are living longer
1/1	The side effects are being healthy
1/-1	The side effects are rare, severe and treatable BUT the wrong treatment could also make it worse! Therefore I don't think it's crazy for a short pause to better inform doctors and patients what to do, as long as the pause does not go very long.
1/1	The side effects are temporary and minor. Ill take it
0/0	The side effects are why i refuse to take the vaccine
0/0	The side effects is are minimal‚Äù Ok... yeah. Uhh... the vaccines have only been in people‚Äôs bodies for a few months... not years. So stop generalizing. Cause we‚Äôre not factoring LONG TERM side effects
0/0	The side effects of the vaccine are the same symptoms you get with covid, a bit strange if you ask me
1/1	The side effects of the vaccine is gonna damage less people than Covid itself
1/1	The side effects of the vaccine were nothing compared to my covid experience
1	The side effects of vaccines are minimal if any.
0/0	The side effects won't be able to be realized for years, and by then billions will have the purposeful sterilization side effects
1/1	The six cases were out of a total of nearly 7 million doses given since March, meaning the CDC and FDA assumed the chances of the blood clot were around 1 in 1 million. This is a joke. The risk is soo small as to be nonexistent. The CDC are idiots.
1/-1	The snobbish lipstick relatively present because income subsequently scold regarding a screeching sort. squeamish, delicious square
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	The so called virus is just being used as a vector for the all important toxic vaccine.
1/1	The sooner everyone is vaccinated the sooner we can go back to normal
1/1	The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner everyone gets back to drinking and business as usual.
1	The speed at which they've got these vaccines ready is nothing short of incredible
0/-1	The speed of which these vaccines were manufactured is astonishing. HIV have been there for a longer time yet no vaccines for it.
0/0	The spike protein in the virus turned out to be an easy target for the vaccines to attack. I don‚Äôt know why I would want to get sick to get immunity
0/0	The spread of Guillan Barre' syndrome will be rampant , with the advent of this vaccine.
0/0	The studies were done (scientific ones, I‚Äôm sure, peer reviewed, obviously). The study conclusion: anti-vaxxers kill. I know of thousands of parents who vaccinated but wish they hadn‚Äôt. I know zero parents who didn‚Äôt vaccinate & wish they had. But if science says so, must be true
1/1	The sudden advance and efficacy/safety of RNA vaccines is going to be a huge boon.
1/-1	The suffering and death that COVID-19 brings makes it imperative that we do everything we can to protect each other. This is all about being responsible, whatever it takes.
0/1	The suppression of the anti-vaccine movement is not in line with how a free society should be operating.
0/0	The survival rate for people infected with Covid is around 99.5%. The efficacy of this new fast-track vaccine is said to be 90%. Err... I'll trust my own natural immune system, thank you very much!
0/0	The system is: create a problem and sell them the solution.
0/0	The thing I am going to tell you is weird but a cure. it is my 20 years experience over pneumonia üåà A healthy man doesn't need to be vaccinated of any covid 19 vaccine because this immunity doesn't work for long and second thing covid 19 is not harmful for everyone and the vaccine is not a solution because covid 19 mutilated itself with time third thing, can a vaccine treat body inflammation or pneumonia? answer is no! and the other thing is. If covid 19 is so fatal it would have killed every affected patient. And next thing why the death ratio is different through out the world .actually it is patient body's overwhelming action on corona that makes the situation worst and because of this patient's body get inflamed and later he faces septicemia and it is a cause of death. In some cases the patient faces some heart and kidney related problems. and the thing is responsible for this, it is inflammation because inflammation damages patient's respiratory system and it is the reason for whole crisis. Because in lack of oxygen the patient's body system get destroyed and septicemia make the situation dreadful . because of it patient's body lose it's capability to kill the virus. I make you sure that The patient's body has capability to fight against covid 19 no matter what type of virus is that. but it needs time and the patient has to avoid inflammation . and it is the way the patient can avoid inflammation. Believe or not we can resist our body inflammation by controlling our eating habits it is possible. I am a patient of pneumonia myself and I was fed up of allopathic treatment but I followed some aurvedic instructions and some research was done by myself , today I am hundred percent healthy. I don't face pneumonia since last two years. There is no possible vaccine for corona and only Ayurveda can save from this mysterious virus. If someone gets affected with covid 19 he should eat only the following things. if a corona patient eats the following things his body would not produce mucus and he is safe - the things are - wheat, gram(chana) , white sugar, milk ( milk from animals) and all products made from milk , salt, red chili, mutton, chicken, fish, mustered oil, tea, masoor dal(peagion food ) ,green leaves but not Cobbage, remember all this products mustn't be contaminated and they must be pure. if the patient eat these things and don't eat enything else and follows these instructions strictly. Covid 19 can not harm him at any how . it takes 15 to 18 days because the patient would have eaten something already that his body would take 15 days to stop producing mucus. If someone get affected with covid 19 he must consume the said foods because this thing takes 15 to 16 days and if someone delays to apply this thing. The situation would be out of control so apply this thing immediately and the patient must wash his nose with hot water. I mean warm water and inhale hot water thrice a day by his nose and he shouldn't mix the cold water into the hot water to get the temperature down because if he does so. I don't know why but the result will be zero. so to get the temperature down either the patient can pour the water or he should wait for some time. I think Patient nose is a heaven for the virus because neither body's action nor medicine works there the patient must wash his nose. how, it is on himself because virus enter into the lungs from here and the patient get affected again and again. it is my personal experience and please have a trust on it.the patient mustn't eat the fruits neither a single bite and others vegetables besides green leaf because fruits and vegetables are the main source or cause to makes our body producing mucus. It means if the patient follows the said instructions his body never get inflammation and a healthy person doesn't need to follow this formula. It is for those who are under threat and either they have a history of pneumonia or they are in their old ages and patients of diabetes or at high risk. besides them no need to worry it is only common cold for a healthy person nothing more. I am a patient of pneumonia and I have been researching on pneumonia for last 18 years. if the patient trusts this thing. and applying this thing. he never need a vantilater and he never going to face any worst or a death. do you know why the death ratio is less in poor countries. it is the reason. the poor people don't eat fruits and vegetables as much compare to the richer and mostly the rich people have been dying with corona. a six month old child never faces pneumonia because he fed only its mother's milk. a wild animal never face pneumonia because he never eats another feed besides green leaves, a man never faces pneumonia if he eats the said things. and if you get over with it once you needn't to worry at all( if you are not a patient of pneumonia). friends pneumonia made my body too sensitive. so I discovered this thing. it took me 18 to 20 years to sort out these things. I have most sensitive body because if I eat an orange I get a body pain immediately and if I eat rice continously for four and five days I get cold that turns itself into pneumonia after one or two days I have faced corona and it took me 16 days To get rid of it and it was like a some different kind of cold for me i lost my appetite, smell and test. I became weak my nose was running continuesly for four five days but I didn't face any mucus problem I have seen it. It was very dreadful but I saved my life because I am on the said diet already but if I won't have known this thing I would be a dead man yet for sure with this therapy you can cure septicemia or such wounds that not have been getting cured for long time. It takes fifteen to eighteen days to get the results starting. (A healthy person must avoid fruits and vegetables during the infection. and an under threat person must eat the said foods during the infection) Note: vitamin c daily value is different for different people. a patient of pneumonia needs very little amount of vitamin c and green leaves like spinach and lettuce can full fill this need perfectly.
1/1	The thinking of those refusing to be vaccinated, if present 50-100 years ago, would mean we‚Äôd still be battling small pox, typhus, and polio myelitis. They don‚Äôt want to recognize that most of those vaccines also had their version of emergency approval.
0/0	The thought of knowingly infecting yourself with a disease is so frightening to me,
0/0	The thought of polio coming back auctually scares me
0/0	The thrust from gaits and the powerful elite is reason enough to NOT get poked.
1	The tinfoil hat brigade should be made to watch this. (only kidding, you'll not change their dangerous opinions). Still, I'm very impressed by how this explanation is both easy-to-understand, and without hyperbole. Thank you. üëç
1/-1	The tinfoil on the internet. What a joke.
0/0	The toxic synthetic nanobot containing vaccine.
1/1	The tragedy in all this is that a good 30% of the population won‚Äôt want it because they saw some shitty anti-vaccine meme on Facebook. This pandemic has exposed the best of us and the worst of us.
1/1	The tragic thing is, by failing to get the vaccine, the pandemic deniers don‚Äôt just harm themselves: they harm responsible people, too.
0/0	The treatment is worse than the disease üòë
1/1	The treatments have to be proven to work to be meaningful
1/1	The trials are done, what are you talking about? Phase 3 of the testing was done since July until December. There were more than 40,000 participants, half got the vaccine, the other half a placebo. There were no deaths. There was a 95% reduction of transmission in the vaccinated group (169 sick in the placebo group, only 9 in the vaccine group). There were 10 cases with severe symptoms in total, and only 1 was in the vaccinated group (same symptoms as you can get with Covid-19). The issues you're mentioning are appearing on people with allergies, which are already advised not to take the vaccine as well as immunocompromised people. They are relying on everyone else to protect them. Chance of getting serious side effects from the vaccine are unimaginably low compared to the benefits. The only reason you're subjective is because you're emotionally connected with the person in this video, but you can't even imagine what you'd think or how you'd feel if you were a medical worker and had to work with people who struggle to breathe every day.
1/1	The trouble is, those who refuse the vaccination are potentially threatening the lives of those who can't have tbe vaccination due to health conditions. Are you happy that?
0/-1	The truth is these people don‚Äôt understand the global banking system and the scamdemic.

1/1	The vaccination centre I work at recorded the most we‚Äôve done in a day yesterday. We absolutely smashed them out all day. Everyone was literally going as fast as they safely could all day. So many of the patients coming through everyday say things like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let me hold you up! There are lots of people that need this after me!‚Äù It‚Äôs great that everyone is in it together! It‚Äôs also one of the few things in the country that‚Äôs actually going better than we expected!

0/-1	The vaccine is killing people that they killed young people to protect from the virus they could never control.
1/0/1/1/-1	The vaccine is kinda like that friend that took the final early and can tell you what to study.
0/-1	The vaccine is like the crocodiles waiting for the zebras to cross the Nile river. The zebra that goes into water gets eaten but the zebra on land goes into the water anyway.
0/0	The vaccine is made by Bill Gates. I'm not taking it
0/0	The vaccine is made with aborted fetal tissue. And for all of these reasons I will never receive a coronavirus vaccine ever.
0/0	The vaccine is more of a threat to me and my family than covid. So I wont be taking it
0/0	The vaccine is not a cure. And why are you so scared of this virus when you have an immune system? Living in fear like you do is the reason you will get the virus.
1/1	The vaccine is not just slowing the spread, but even more importantly reducing the rate of deaths.
1/1	The vaccine is not likely to be harmful. It would increase your body‚Äôs immune response against the virus.
1/1	The vaccine is not made to harm. If it was there wouldn‚Äôt be various types on the market. It would be the same vaccine all over the world
1/0	The vaccine is not the answer is better than no vaccine. Someone else already working on developing a drug that already existing and will prevent the coronavirus to enter the human body.
1/0	The vaccine is only 50% effective to avoid people getting the disease but 100% effective avoiding bad cases that need internation. This should have been explained better here!
1/1	The vaccine is only mandatory if you want to work or go to school again. Do your part. Don't be a deplorable vector.
1/1/1	The vaccine is perfectly safe. Now get in line and take your shot.
0/0	The vaccine is poison!
0/0	The vaccine is poison, do your own research!!

1/1	The vaccine is safe
1/1	The vaccine is safe and definitely safer than getting COVID
1/1	The vaccine is safe and people should fulfil their public duty in getting vaccinated when called upon to do so.
1/1	The vaccine is safe compared to COVID that has killed 565,000 Americans
1/1	The vaccine is safe!
0/1	The vaccine is safe! What a joke, please those who believe the vaccine take it and safe the world and we who don't believe will just go on following safety and distance procedures
1/1	The vaccine is safe. Period.
1/1	The vaccine is safer than getting covid itself, and at this point those are really the only options we have...
1/1/1/-1	The vaccine is spreading 10x faster than the virus. Just waiting for me to catch it... The vaccine, not the virus.
0/0	The vaccine is the mark of the Beast

1/1	The vaccine is very effective
1/1	The vaccine is very effective according to the experiment
1/1	The vaccine is working! Yes!
0/0	The vaccine isn't even a real vaccine One of the ingredients is formaldehyde. And covid is fake anyway
0/0	The vaccine isn‚Äôt reliable! I know someone who had her first dose of the vaccine and then caught covid.
0/0	The vaccine issue is really about Corporate Science as dogma overriding both consumer's & individual's rights. There is mandatory vaccination vs freedom of choice. There is extremism versus liberty.
1/1	The vaccine kills very very few people, CoViD kills much much more people, so getting vaccinated with any vaccine is a good choice.
1/1	The vaccine kills very very few people, CoViD kills much much more people, so getting vaccinated with any vaccine is a good choice. But it is not true, that no one died from a covid-19 vaccine. The video implies that no one died from a vaccination. To be inaccurate about this fact promotes mistrust in the people and jeopardizes the vaccination campains. So it would be better to correct this video or remove it, because it could cost a lot of lifes. Otherwise it is a very good video.
0/0	The vaccine makers have immunity. But any business or educational institution that mandates employees, students, or customers be vaccinated (or institutes unrealistic requirements for testing in lieu of vaccination) should now be on notice of the risk it is running.
0/0	The vaccine makes you contagious
0/1	The vaccine manufacturers have immunity from all lawsuits. I'll wait.
0/0	The vaccine might effect newborns!!! I'll take that back if they have proof it wont do that
1/1	The vaccine not only protects you but works to limit the potential spread of COVID 19 to others who may not have been vaccinated yet either. Please be responsible and get your vaccine for your family, friends, and the rest of us."
0/0	The vaccine only gives 94% chance of effectiveness while the recovery rate, without vaccine, is 99.9%. I am going to pass on the vaccine thank you very much.
0/-1	The vaccine production and experiment cycle are short
0/0	The vaccine production cycle is too short
1/1	The vaccine protects you against hospitalization and death.
1/-1	The vaccine reduced my age by about 10 years. Greatest thing to ever happen to me.
1	The vaccine reduces your risk of getting the virus by about 90%. We need everyone to get vaccinated to protect anyone for whom the vaccine doesn't work.
1/1	The vaccine rollout has been doing so well! We can get this shit under control by May 31!
1/1	The vaccine rollout will needed to be handled quickly and at a massive scale. It will be one of the defining moments (and hopefully a good one) of Biden's presidency and potentially give him a boost in political capital as well when it happens
1/-1	The vaccine should be made available for anyone that wants it, but should never be forced on anyone.
1/1	The vaccine should be mandatory
1/1	The vaccine should be mandatory for travel.
0/-1	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE" by Polish Author.
1/1	The vaccine should work, so we can go back to normal lifes
1/1	The vaccine sounds so exciting, can't wait to take it.
0/-1	The vaccine studies are rushed, all a shot in the dark, one can‚Äôt just assume they bring a net benefit.
0/0/0	The vaccine survivors are going to have to put their political leaders, vaccine company CEO'S and Mainstream media spruikers into Neuremberg trials, execution by 100 vaccine injections
0/0	The vaccine trials on the few can never emulate the reality of using a new vaccine on the many, maths really, you can expect problems, but rushed tech always will have. If you research into it, eyesight is one of the more serious issues, but you are not dead though. So that makes it ok then.
0/-1	The vaccine type matters to me!
0/0	The vaccine was never necessary because 99.997% of people survive Covid
0/0	The vaccine was never necessary because 99.997% of people survive Covid and when someone survives it, that person becomes immune and will not be capable of passing it onto people. And when enough people have gotten it, herd immunity takes effect and Covid goes extinct. By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
1/1	The vaccine was not rushed, it was expedited. All steps were done. Animal trials, phase 1, 2, and 3. The same amount of hours went into research but more people were doing it. This was made a priority. Get the vaccine. You're healthy, you will be just fine.
0/0	The vaccine was rushed and they couldn't have tested it. Only god knows what kind of long term Side effects there will be.
0/0	The vaccine wasnt made for Covid Covid was made for the vaccine
1/1	The vaccine will contribute to herd immunity. It will also make symptoms less severe. But its important that everyone or as many as possible are vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus.
0/0	The vaccine will learn your body to destroy itself, good luck with your happy shot.
0/0	The vaccine will not protect you from any virus in any way. Even the flu vaccine doesn't protect people from becoming infected with influenza,
0/0	The vaccine will poison everyone!!
0/0	The vaccine will probably give me the chills and headache and nausea
1/1	The vaccine will separate us from the idiots: anti-vax, anti-maskers, anti-science, Trumpeters, aka conspiracy theorists, bye now.
0/0	The vaccine will turn you into a Democrat
1/1/-1/1	The vaccine will work but the question is that will it also work on people who already caught this virus
0/-1	The vaccine works only if you use tried and tested flawed tests ....oh wait !!
0/0	The vaccine works the way it works. You can still get Covid, you can still transmit Covid. Make sure you force people to get vaccinated in order to participate in society though. We are rebranding vaccine failure as ‚Äúbreakthrough cases.‚Äù 134 cases in Charleston, SC 100 cases in Washington 100 cases in Idaho
1/1	The vaccine would be beneficial to our health.
1/1	The vaccine's bound to have side effects, even the flu jab has side effects! Put it this way, have the jab and life will soon return to a sense of normalcy, don‚Äôt have the jab and stay locked in your house and never have a social life again
0/0	The vaccines R designed to kill people gradually so they R working towards depopulation. The masks R designed to limit the intake of oxygen , keeping the fear among human race and also symbolic for silencing real thinkers , they R working to keep sheeple quiet .
0/0	The vaccines a load of bollocks. Usually take decades got this in a year.Unless they had it all along but what is it really for ?
1/1	The vaccines are 100% effective against death.
0/0	The vaccines are a way to eliminate the human race in great numbers and then blame everything on the Pandemic
0/0	The vaccines are all fake, except the Madagascan one! So, I don't need any of them for my children and myself, keep them off us. Never force us for that will cost you so dearly.
1/1	The vaccines are as safe as they can get
1/1/1	The vaccines are effective. Masks and social distancing prevent variants from developing. The thing about science is that you do not propose miracle cures. For example, do you only diet when you have heart disease risk? No: diet, exercise, medication, behavior...
1/1	The vaccines are good. We are going to get out of this. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the message. Carry it forward.
1/1	The vaccines are incredibly safe. The odds of having a blood clot, or dying for one are miniscule at best.
0/0/0/0/0	The vaccines are just as bad as the virus!
1/1	The vaccines are life savers. I'm looking forward to my second dose.
0/0	The vaccines are not a cure.
0/0	The vaccines are not safe.
0/0	The vaccines are poison, wake up sheep!!!
1/1	The vaccines are still worth getting, even if they are slightly less effective against the three new coronavirus strains coming out of the UK, South Africa and Brazil. My expectation is that there will be a third booster shot for the coronavirus vaccine coming up a few months from now, which will be recommended to get as well. Meantime, maintain vigilance: continue to social distance, wear a mask & don't touch your face while outside, wash hands first thing coming inside
0/0	The vaccines aren't safe at all
0/0	The vaccines aren‚Äôt safe at all
1/1	The vaccines cannot cause covid because they aint the virus
0/0	The vaccines could also be leaving people more susceptible to the virus, over-sensitizing them to it.
0/0	The vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid nor does it stop from spreading covid, SO WHY TAKE IT?????? DUH!!!!
0/0	The vaccines don't work. They do not stop transmission and you can still get it after vaccinations
1/1	The vaccines have 99!!!% effectiveness. If you don't take the vaccine, you are stupid.
1/1	The vaccines have all been thoroughly tested and found to be acceptably safe and efficacious.
1/1	The vaccines have the ability to help us return to normal life.
1/1	The vaccines is greatly in need especially to the hard hit Africa, our continent dependence on west economically show s our stand.
1	The vaccines likely reduce contagion
1/1	The vaccines made it through Phase 3 trials... I'll take it! I don't want this virus. Period.
1/1	The vaccines offer one of the ways we may be able to end the pandemic
1/1	The vaccines passed several types of testing and it is safe. This vaccine is not rushed because in the USA we have more critical levels to pass to prove it is safe than other countries do. Pfizer has an outstanding reputation.
1/1	The vaccines protect you. Only 0.008% of people vaccinated got COVID-19 infections. Tell your friends, families and coworkers: it's time to get the vaccine!
1/1	The vaccines substantially reduce the risk of severe infection and death.
0/0	The vaccines we are inundated with will be like sweeties except they might kill you !
1/-1	The vaccines were getting work for COVID-19
0/0	The vaccines will kill us all. Europe, UK, elderly and younger.
1/1	The vaccine‚Äô doesn‚Äôt prevent you getting Covid, it helps reduce the symptoms and side effects that put the most vulnerable into hospital, taking the pressure off the NHS, but like the UK üá¨üáß people they don‚Äôt think üëç like that, just about themselves
1/1	The vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness at preventing severe disease, even with the new variants circulating ‚Äî and with a single shot per person ‚Äî is particularly impressive! Congratulations
1/1/1/1	The vacine production needs to increase, its a race againt the clock..Is the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine really less efective against African variant?
1/1	The vast majority of vaccine skeptics aren‚Äôt willing to give up their jobs, social life, and ability to exist in public over their ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù.
0/0	The vaxxx is only the beginning. Microchips are next...,
0/0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it

0/-1	The vice president didn't get the vaccine. He got the B12 shot
0/0	The virus has a 99.8% survivability rate so why a vaccine is needed idk.
1	The virus has damaged hearts, lungs and brains of asymptomatic survivors, that we already know. Please don‚Äôt be more fearful of the ‚Äúcure‚Äù than the disease.
0	The virus hasn't been here long .so how has the vaccine been tested long enough to know what the long term side effects are??
0/0	The virus is changing, and the vaccine will expire
0/-1	The virus is the wealthy greedy eliteS and they can‚Äôt make it through anything ...but lies...may God judge them accordingly
0/0	The virus is updating, and the vaccine will expire sooner or later
0/0	The virus isn't deadly enough, let's make a deadlier vaccine.
0/0/0/0/0	The virus that is contagious and killing us is money virus
0/1	The way I understand it the vaccines mostly just reduce the chance to end up in hospital.. but not stop you from getting infected and infect others. In that case it would actually increase the spread, since people don‚Äôt worry about infections anymore. So the risk of variants would increase.
0/0	The way they describe the mRNA it literally is the virus. Does the exact same thing as a virus how they explain it. Covid don't exist. The vax is the virus
1/1	The weapon to end the war...
1/1	The whole flipping point of a vaccine is to improve your immune system. Try trusting it more after an improvement in its capabilities
0/0	The whole plandemic was about fooling people onto these vaccination passports which is clearly a disguise for the social credit system. Absolutely reject these things even get rid of all smart equipment in your house if need be.
1/1	The whole thing makes no sense. The chances of getting blood clots are around 00000008.8% from the vaccine. That‚Äôs no reason to stop vaccinating people.
0/0	The whole vaccination scheme is a joke when will you people realize this
0/0	The whole world was going to be vaccinated for swine flu in the 70s. Where are those shots ,? Where is swine flu. .? That was called a pandemic too....
0/0	The whole year this covid 19....84 has been around. I have yet to see any sign of it. I don't need a questionable vaccine,to deliver me from a non threatening illness. Do you trust your own judgement. Or trust Gates, the W H O, U N, dodgy politico's with ties to big pharma, propaganda media, which first scare you into thinking there's a threat, then scare you into taking the cure to their threat. On this subject there are two kinds of people. Those who think for themselves. And those who outsource their thinking to government.
0/0	The word covid 19 and vaccines makes me vomit
0/-1	The work you are doing is incredible and you've helped create probably the most powerful movement on the truth about vaccines.

0	The world most deadly vakscene all of them want locking up for crime against humanity.
1/1	The worst thing will be that those people will say "look i didn't get vaccinated and I'm totally fine, this vaccine is useless"
0/1	The ‚Äòcure‚Äô must not be worse than the ‚Äòdisease‚Äô
1/-1	Their illness unlikely attributed to vaccine.
1/1	Their is only one way to get control of this virus. Vaccinations. Not wearing a mask, not washing your hands, and not social distancing. You may not be considered having a risk factor in how covid affects your body, but you very well may contract this virus leading to another human beings death. Life is not safe. It never has been or never will be. So, we have two scenarios. One, live like the way we all have for the past year and will far into the future, or do what can be done as a person to help stop this. And, the only way to do that is bite the bullet and get vaccinated. Don't be so afraid of what can happen to you by this vaccine that you forget how to live. As far as myself and my wife. We received our second dose over a month ago. And, we are still here.
0/-1	Their messing with dna the can destoroy the wey u look ?

1/1	Then I'll get one. To protect people like you.
1/1	Then bring it on! I'll be first in line when it's ready and I fall into the at risk group. I wonder how many people have had the shingles vaccine? The first shot was a breeze, but the second shot made me sick as a dog.Still, I'm willing to put up with some discomfort to be free of fear of catching Covid.
0/0	Then just inject water or bathe in garlic, just as effective by this logic.
1/1	Then make the vaccinations more readily available.
0/0	Then tell me why my child was normal until his MMR vaccine? The government loves ppl like you. Blinded by the truth and easy to manipulate
0/0	Then the current Covid-19 vaccines are just a reintroduction of Covid-19 into your body, no difference
1/0	Then there is the theory that covid-19 vaccination will be a ploy to microchip people as we do pets.
0/0	Then they start eating people
0/0	Then why are those fully vaccinated still getting the virus if its successful? Hmm
0/0	Then why did you get vaccinated dumbass
0/0	Then why get the vaccine? Don‚Äôt force anyone to get your poison!
1/-1	Then you can hope that we who have a long way to go for the vaccine can get it
1/0	Then you must forgo treatment whe gasping for air if you contract corona as you know better
1/1	There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization.
1/1	There a threat to those who can't like those who are immunocompromised. If someone doesnt get vaccinated against a disease there not only risking themselves but also the most vulnerable.
1/1	There are 1.1 billion anti-vaxers according to plague inc, so if that is true, it proves human stupidity.
0/0	There are 4 kinds of vaccines. 1. Poison 2. Poison 3. Poison 4. Poison
1/1	There are 450 million citizens in the EU, if you vaccinate every person in the EU with vaccine ~ 450 people will die (1 in a million). At the moment, we have thousand dying per day. Why can't people do the maths
1/1	There are ALWAYS side effects with vaccines... rabbit, smallpox, flu, whatever... So what ?
0/0	There are LOTS of people refusing. Myself included. I‚Äôd rather not poison myself. Thanks anyway.
0/0	There are NO scientific studies to prove vaccines don't cause autism !!!
0/0	There are SOOO many things going on. They know very little for sure. Vaccines RUIN the immune system. ALL ABSOLUTE B.S. It is CRIMINAL TO GIVE THIS POISON TO ANYONE, IMMENSELY WORSE TO CHILDREN WHO ARE HARDLY EVER AFFECTED.
1/1	There are a lot friends in my circle who are just skeptical about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine (understandably so; they are not anti vaxers). I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit. However I‚Äôd prefer to see more data by the time my time comes. Not vaccinated while the world opens up around you will be ten times more scarier to me because of increased chances of getting it due to mobility
1/1	There are at least ten vaccines that are in various stages of trials, these are just the three that are the furthest along. We'll need as many as we can get.
0/0	There are claims that vaccination was rushed, or that ‚Äúcorners were cut‚Äù in the clinical trials or the government‚Äôs safety review and approval process.
0/0	There are demons disguised as people among us. Vaccines are Satan's tool
1/1	There are many heroes emerging during this pandemic. These guys, arguably, are at the top of the heap!
1/1	There are many vaccines around the world that prevent Covid. None are 100% effective but still likely to prevent death or serious illness.
1/1	There are millions of people to vaccinate and the NHS are doing more than their best . We will have it done but don‚Äôt put them under more pressure than they are already.
0/0	There are more people dying from the vaccin than from covid. When are people openingen there eyes? Only 0.23% of all the covid patients will die. Thats a survival rate of 99.67% WAKE UP!!!!! World Health Organization (WHO) you are killing people with vaccins and stupid rulea. They are NOT dying from covid19
0/0	There are natural ways to boost our immunity & safeguard our health rather than taking a vaccine!
1/0	There are no anti vaxxer vids on YT that explain why they are of the opinion they are...
1/1	There are no excuses in 21st century to even consider not to vaccinnating for a second
0/0	There are no side effects to any drug, it's the effect of the drug. If you don't take it you will not be affected, whatever happens to you when you take it is not a side effect it's a direct effect. Stop playing with words!
0/0	There are one million viruses on planet Earth. And thousands are more dangerous than Covid. Do you take vaccines for each one of them?
0/0	There are people dying just hours and a day or week after all of these vaccinations. The companies lie. The press lies .
1/1	There are possible side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine that is very normal
1/1	There are quite a few news reports in the US of people contacting COVID after getting the vaccine. Every one of them said the COVID was mild and none of these folks were hospitalized or died.
1/1	There are risks with everything. We all take chances in life.
1/1	There are so many benefits to this vaccine that I hope they can figure out how to remove the blood clotting issue. So many ppl want to just toss the vaccine completely instead of focusing on tweaking it to fix this one problem.
1/1	There are some realy smart people at work
0/-1/-1	There are still many unknowns. Such as how long the immunity will last. Even though the J&J vaccine has a lower efficacy, its possible that it may last longer than the others. There's not enough data yet to make a series of declarative statements that the public wants.
0/0	There are studies showing that the vaccine actually makes them susceptible to a much severe respiratory coronavirus issue in the future
0/0	There are the side effects. Anaphylaxis‚Äîor a severe allergic reaction‚Äîis possible
0/0	There are tons of money involved in the vaccines battle so never trust capitalist.
1/1	There are two bad things to weigh against each other, so you choose what you think is least bad. One of the scales is the risk of side effects or other shit with taking the vaccine. In the other scale lies the risk of becoming ill and perhaps losing smell and taste forever (is life worth living then?) And the risk of spreading the infection to others who are unvaccinated. I will get vaccinated!
1/1	There are zero deaths attributed directly to the vaccine yet, at least as of February 16.
0/0	There aren't 'mountains of data' proving otherwise, but there is an alarmingly growing amount of data that they do cause autism, amoung other things. We are the only country that is vaccinating our kids to death. Other western countries are not buying into he propaganda our country is trying to sell them, for good reason. They have seen the same effects. The pharmaceautical industry is a billion dollar industry, and the biggest industry in the United States. It is bigger, and more corrupt, than oil.
1/-1	There has been a lot of talk about children's mental health as a reason to open everything and return to normal. On the other side of things, losing a parent is pretty brutal for a child's mental health for the rest of their lives.
0/0/0	There has never been a vaccine for corona virus . And you can NOT see into the future to know what effect or damage this vaccine might do.
0/-1	There has never been a vaccine to any of the other coronaviruses, and this supposed new one...less than a year with no proper testing.....done.....come on folks
1/1	There have been a lot of studies that requiring vaccines for school does actually improve vaccination numbers because homeschooling is a lot of work.
0/0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK because of vaccination
0/0/0/0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK.

0/0	There have been deaths concerning the covid vaccine... have you not seen it in the news‚Ä¶
0/-1	There have been four serious cases of clotting and low platelets in people who have taken the J&J vaccine. Three occurred in the United States, the EMA said on Friday. One person has sadly died.
0/0	There have been many great documentaries showing vaccine injury. But NOTHING has ever shown vaccine-free families.
0/0	There have been several cases of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reaction, among people with a history of such reactions who received the COVID-19 vaccine.
0/0	There have been severe side effects, including death, with the other two vaccines too but were ignored by the CDC. Something strange is going on.
1/1/1/1	There haven't been any weird side-effects or problems for my mother. She has diabetes and got her second dose recently.
0/0	There is NOTHING wrong with not wanting to get vaccinated. People should not be forced to put a MAN MADE chemical into their body to pacify someone else.
0/0/0	There is a Hell of lot of sheep who believe the government still. They wont wake up until they face reality
1/1	There is a MUCH greater chance of dying from COVID than from this vaccine.
1/1	There is a big misunderstanding about this second dose and this 3 week time period . The three week time period is mainly a time period used specifically for the vaccine trials and thus the time frame officially recommended. It is not a time scale of vaccine effectiveness . And it has been discussed a longer time may be even advantageous. Its also looking like with new mutations , we will all need constant rolling vaccines every 4 to 6 months probably to keep up so uk has actually got it spot I believe. Israel is one big test research for Pfizer that gives Israel special perks for the exclusivity so some research from Israel should be taken with a commercial bias perhaps , but its all good that Israel and Pfizer are doing with their vaccine program
0/0	There is a chance that Covid vaccination will have to be annual. If it does become annual, imagine trying to vaccinate the entire world every year. I rather just boost my immune system.
1/-1	There is a lag Between getting #Covid19vaccination & Protection. Vaccine protects most, but not all infection. Vaccines don‚Äôt work Retroactively. Certain Variants could be less Susceptible to vaccines. Vaccines prevent disease but not all infection.
1/1	There is a lot of misinformation about vaccines out there, so here is some basic science on how they have work.
1/1	There is a lot of misinformation around vaccines. While vaccines are risky, the benefits outweigh the risks.
0/0	There is a man take a vacin 2 days after the man died due to defecult to breath..

0/0	There is a risk
1/1	There is a shocking amount of relief that I didn‚Äôt anticipate after getting my first dose of the #CovidVaccine and I am so thankful for this when my educator friends and I head back into the building...#StrongerTogether
0/0/0	There is absoletely no reason to risk your health on an experimental gene therapy unless you want to become infertile or have trisomic childs.
0/0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines
0/0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I‚Äôve never heard such nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccinate people who aren‚Äôt at risk from a disease.
0/0	There is absolutely no way I am going to take the vaccine. I hope those who want to take are able to and have access, but for me I just simply will not be taking it.
0	There is actually a group on Facebook for victim‚Äôs of the vaccine a lot of them in the group are sharing their experiences and losing their loved ones to the vaccine as well as the horrible side effects. It‚Äôs so heartbreaking especially cause the media will not cover it.
1/1	There is allways those idiots that truly believe vaccines to be dangerous and refuse to take them.
1/1	There is also no data to suggest there is a problem. Surely if the vaccine was as deadly as people on here claim, people would be dropping like flies right about now.
0/0	There is also the moral issue of using a treatment which is based on using aborted fetus cells. As a pro-lifer, I refuse this vaccine.
0/0	There is far too much money on the line with the useless and pointless Covid-19 vaccine for it to ever be pulled. It could cause people to grow three heads and the authorities would still let it be rolled out
1/1	There is light at the end of the tunnel by taking the vaccine
0/0	There is little transparency around science required.
0/0	There is live covid 19 virus in the vaccine. Does it make any sense to inject it into your body?
1/1	There is more chance of complication from having a tattoo than complications arising from having the vaccine.
1/1	There is more of a chance of getting a blood clot with the P pill than with the AZ vaccine. But woman take them anyway. Check the facts. Both the EU and the media are blowing it up more than it needs to. The vaccine has saved millions of people and only 79 blood clots!
0/0	There is more to it. First off, the J & J vaccine was pulled recently and then back on the market. These vaccines are not fully tested yet & ppl are flocking to get a DNA altering drug. Not me, I have Leukemia & not taking any chances on something that is not ready.
0/1	There is no 'if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger' with viruses.
0/0	There is no avaible treatment ... It just to make people vaccinated i'm not a rabit to test on me we should focus more on tratement than. Testing we're wasting ressources in testing i won t take it
1/1	There is no challenge here. Just make employment contingent on getting a vaccine. It's that simple to solve this problem.
0/0	There is no data if the vaccin works(!), and if stops the virus from spreading. These are facts. Then what's the use of this vaccine which is created in a year? Ask yourself why. We don't have knowledge what mRNA will do in the long run. How can it be then, that this vaccin is being enrolled on such a large scale? Ask yourself why. The ancient tactic divide and conquer is proving to be effective once again. The collective subconciousness has taken over and the world is in a mass regression. What is coming to my mind right now, is a video I once watched of a former KGB agent. He was smiling and saying, it takes a while to brainwash people, maybe 10/20 years but it's effective. Even if you shove the facts under their nose (literally), they will not believe it. I researched many hours and gathered these facts from different sources and scientific reports. You should do the same.
0/-1	There is no debate over safety if long term studies have not been done. You can't call it safe, in fact its hugely irresponsible and liable claims should be filed against those who say its safe without any long term effects data available. If its safe then allow Phizer etc to be sued over any future adverse effects.
1/1	There is no evidence of a pandemic apart from 3 million dead and counting!
1/-1	There is no evidence of non white people Says white supremacist
1/1	There is no evidence that the risks of vaccination outweighs the benefits of getting vaccinated. Oh also, Facebook posts and instagram doesn't count as research or evidence.
0/0	There is no good reason for me to take an experimental vaccine.
1/1	There is no good reason to not get this vaccine. Do it for your family and friends if not for yourself. At this time it's pretty selfish to not do your part to get rid of this virus.
0/0	There is no long term research on these vaccines. The people taking it are the Guinea pigs for research on these vaccines. Fact!
0/0	There is no long term research to back up their claims. So good luck!
0	There is no long-term testing of the vaccines.
0/0/0/0	There is no money/profit in Health, only in sickness!
0/0	There is no need for a vaccine
1/1	There is no other way that to get vaccined.. Don‚Äôt behave with stupidity!!
0/0	There is no point by the end of 2020 we'll probably all be dead anyway √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
1/1	There is no pressing doubts, the only cases where people caught it again were extreme outliers.
0/0	There is no proof that ordering from your favorite restaurant tonight while watching your favorite show is an effective COVID vaccine but there is also no proof that it is NOT an effective vaccine. So I say let it rip, friends.
0/-1	There is no proof the vaccine will stop you from getting the virus or from spreading it. It just minimizes the symptoms.
1/1	There is no such thing as safe. Taking the vaccine means accepting a risk. Not taking the vaccine means accepting a risk. Personally I feel the risk of not taking the vaccine is far higher than the risk of taking the vaccine so when it‚Äôs my turn I‚Äôll gladly take my vaccine, but I‚Äôm not waiting patiently. I‚Äôm constantly checking the news and occasionally (politely) checking with my local GP to find out how far down the list of priorities they are so that I can get an idea of when my turn will come.
0/0/0	There is no sufficient evidence on the safety of the vaccine because it hasn't been sufficiently tested. The vaccine can't be mandatory until enough data on mortality and permanent conditions induced by it will be available. They make us sign a paper that states that nobody is responsible for any adverse reaction that one might get after taking it, if it was safe this wouldn't be necessary. If I get severly compromised, who is going to pay?
1/1	There is no threat. We are not taking part in a trial or experimentation. The vaccines have been approved through use by experts, parts of the vaccine (non-specific to covid) have been in development and testing for years. You can refuse the vaccine. I suggest you read up.
0/0	There is no vaccine for this virus. You will see nothing but blood after the vaccine! DO NOT TAKE IT!!
0	There is no virus..coronavirus is the common cold..the vaccine will change your DNA forever.
0/0	There is no way I'm taking this
0/0	There is no way Im getting these vaccines.
0/0/0/0/0	There is no way I‚Äôm taking a vaccine right away. I‚Äôm waiting at least a year to see what happens to y‚Äôall.
0/-1	There is no way im taking the shot.
0/-1	There is no way of knowing at this point how these vaccines will affect each person. It takes a long time to develop a vaccine. This warp speed vaccine was not tested long enough. They don't know the actual short, or long term side effects. Or, if it will potentially cause permanent damage, or death because there's no way of knowing at this time.
0/0	There is noooo pandemic only plandemic.
0/0	There is not nearly enough research for me to feel comfortable to get the vaccine. I‚Äôm only 13 and I don‚Äôt want to go blind, have fertility issues, get really sick, etc.
1/1/1/1	There is nothing wrong with the J&J vaccine. You don't have to alter your DNA when you take that one and it provides the best long term immunity.
0/0	There is nothing you can say, or do to convince me to be injected with that poison.
1/1	There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.
1/1	There is plenty of evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccine.
1/1	There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
1/0	There is such an absurd amount of misinformation in this content section. Just goes to show you that it's only "trust the scientists" when they back up your preconceived arguments.
0/0/0/-1	There isn't any knowledge or data of the side affects because it hasn't been tested. She is contradicting herself.
1/0	There isn't any knowledge or data of the side affects because it hasn't been tested. Vaccination is fine.
1/-1	There must be some ways to get the vaccines to the people much quicker. For example in the old days during the 1776 the guns were very slow and ineffective. They involved a lot steps before they can fire the shots. But later during the 1863 the new faster guns were invented called the Gatling guns. I was just wondering if we all can come up with the better ways to get people vaccinated faster and faster as we continue to find better faster ways like people did in the past.
1/-1	There needs to be hundreds of more videos like this to educate the extremely ignorant public
1/1	There needs to be hundreds of more videos like this to educate the extremely ignorant public.
1/-1	There really shouldn't be many more hospitalisations or deaths, almost everyone who was vulnerable has been vaccinated. Over 95% of the over 70 population have received at least one dose of a vaccine, over 90% of the 50 to 70 age group and over 95% of care home residents. The current daily average for Covid deaths is in the low to mid thirties. If it goes up very much from that I will be very surprised and more than a bit disappointed. New infections will undoubtedly rise, but the theory is that what has been a very successful vaccination programme should have broken the link between the number of new infections and the number of hospitalisations and deaths. We shall see. This is the first proper test of a vaccination programme in a populous country, and a populous country with an estimated base of some quarter of a million plus Covid infected people in that population.
1/1	There should be a country formed somewhere out in the ocean for all those who do not take the vaccine to protect those waiting to get it.
0/0/0	There was never a pandemic
0/0	There was never a pandemic only a seasonal flu famously renamed
1/1	There were only 6 out of 6, 000, 000 so a 1 in a million chance
0/0	There will NEVER be a cure..
0/0	There will NEVER be a cure...
1/1	There will always be someone who have a deadly reaction against the vaccine. No drug is ever 100 percent safe.
0/0	There will be an enormous cover up over these reactions to this dangerous vaccine
1/1	There will be no dumb people when the anti vaxxers die right?
1/1	There's 70 million adults are more scared of the scientist lab produced vaccine than a wild virus that probably mutated in a bat cave with nearly 600,000 deaths. At some point you need to pass them by and move on to people who aren't in neat categories and aren't scared of a vaccine.
1/0	There's a difference between strong immune system and healthy immune system. Strong will kill you healthy will not
1/1	There's a lot of great news lately, despite the variants - all vaccines seem to protect against severe disease from all current variants. It seems like post-vaccination life will be very close to normal, and Covid will actually be like a mild flu then
1/-1	There's an art to explaining complex issues (Vaccines) in an easy-to-understand manner.
1/-1	There's an art to explaining complex issues in an easy-to-understand manner.
0/0	There's billions of all types of viruses. When you go the route of creating artificial immunity via medical intervention as the only viable means, it will never end. You'll need billions of vaccines. Truth is that the immune system gets stronger by being around people and that is exactly what those in "control" want to prevent
0/0	There's certainly a search for a safe effective vaccine but worries that companies or governments might push through something that isn't ready or properly tested is certainly a fair one to have, especially once you consider that Reddit is a global website and not every country and culture has a good history with being able to trust their doctors.
0/0	There's going to be more viruses and lockdowns. People will continue to get vaccines for every virus that emerges. It's sickening!
0/0	There's many reasons NOT to take any vaccine ESPECIALLY this one
1/1/1/-1	There's no "Pro-vaccine" There's just "Anti-vaccine" and normal people
0/0	There's no conspiracy theory here. Distrust is very very real.
1/0	There's no evidence the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe if you're pregnant.
0/0	There's no pandemic
0/0	There's no such thing as a coincidence. Keep my vaccines.
0/-1	There's no such thing as coronavirus, prove me wrong. I can prove my side
0/0	There's no way I take the coronavirus vaccine as things are. I'm not anti vac at all, I've had everything. The testing on this vaccine is next to non existent and several people have became extremely ill from them at testing.
1/1	There's no way people can be this dumb. They really think the vaccine isn't safe? I've just been reading some of the comments... it's bewildering
0/0	There's no way to prove it doesn't affect fertility. The data is not available yet. Not going to risk my children's future fertility for a cold/flu virus with over a 99% survival rate.
0/0	There's nobody they wouldn't tell it was safe to take vaccine. My trust in the media is far gone. There is no level they will not stoop to
1/0	There's side effect if you don't get it you won't be around
1	There's so many scaredy cat people who don't want to get the vaccine. It's a piece of cake. Plus you won't be a spreader and get sick. Man up and do it
0/0	There's surely a conspiracy behind but....I'll never find out.
1/1	There's undue attention being paid to the effectiveness of each vaccine candidate. Seasonal flu vaccines are often less than 50% effective and are still considered a worthy use of NHS funds. Fact: any level of effectiveness will help to reduce the R number. Got that? Now, let's stop fussing about a few percentage points, and the horrible prospect of idiots demanding different types of vaccines.
1	There's yet to be any scientifically sound evidence to prove otherwise (that vaccines aren't safe and effective)
0/0	Theres a 98.5% chance of surviving covid and a 100% chance i wont get your bs shot.
0/0	Theres a lot of excitement around the new record vaccines???? Is there really? Maybe for the stupidly brainwashed
1/1	Theres a research paper out today and there's an article about it in the Telegraph it seems the Oxford vaccine is very effective.
0/0/0	Theres too much false information i don't trust the vaccine i'm waiting
0/0	There‚Äôs a lot bots commenting on this video how they got the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine.Don‚Äôt fall for the trap!
1/1	There‚Äôs a lot of vaccine preference conversations happening right now. Can we take a step back and just appreciate a >90% effective vaccine from multiple producers that have had only a handful of complications out of tens of millions? All of this was implemented in less than a year to wrangle a virus that is/was dominating the world. It‚Äôs an incredible light at the end of the tunnel and I‚Äôm so grateful that everyone in my family and I were able to get jabbed.
0/0	There‚Äôs a plethora of bad side effects caused by this vaccine that are worse than the virus it was created to protect people from.
1/1	There‚Äôs no causal evidence for any bad side effects. This vaccine is safer than any other in history as it does not involve injecting any virus into the body.
0/0	There‚Äôs no reason for me to get the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0	There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking this shit
1/1	There‚Äôs no win win only loose loose till we can get enough vaccine into arms
1/0	There‚Äôs not enough vaccines right now, if there projection of when there will be- it‚Äôs to late.
0/0	There‚Äôs therapeutics that CAN HELP WHY are they so against these meds? Could the big PUSH OF VACCINES be for $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ and or population control???
0/-1	These 2 don't even know they re being used
0/0	These Doctors won‚Äôt even take it!!!
0/0/0/0	These Doctors won‚Äôt even take it!!! They just going to wait it out until the people that got vaccinated lost their mind
1/1	These antivaxxers could be guilty of culpable homicide. Governments should pass emergency legislation to prevent these radicals from having a platform to spread their dangerous views
0/-1	These are 6 cases in over 6 million J&J vaccines administered, so a much lower frequency.
1/1	These are all coincidences. Vaccines don't cause death I think you're getting mixed up, it's anti Vax people that cause death. If someone can't get the vax for some reason, and then 6 other ppl in their class CHOOSE not too then it's not only putting your child at risk, it's also putting all the children who physically CAN'T have the vax in danger. You put your siblings, friends and everyone who can't have it done in danger. It keeps getting passed on and turns into an epidemic.
0/0	These are gene modification tools, nothing to do whatsoever with keeping the population safe.
0/-1	These are the endocrine disrupters in your child's Vaccines. But hey! Don't believe me! Do the research below!
0/0	These aren‚Äôt vaccines they are mRNA treatments and other vaccines were fda approved
0	These big pharma poison manufacturers were given totally immunity.
0/0	These comments give me hope.. \nLove all of you! Stay safe! \nR.E.S.I.S.T!!!
0/0	These covid 19 vaccines are the way to control your mind
0/0	These covid vaccines are funded by Bill Gates, he has admitted to his desire to depopulize the earth, thru vaccines, abortion ect. He believes the world is overpopulated, its a lie, the earth can sustain a whole lot more humans, its only big cities like NY, Tokyo, LA. The world has space, its not over populated. I don't trust a vaccine, but I trust my immune system and taking care of my health, and have vitamins, I trust in God. This is a Plandemic, not a pandemic. The news is propaganda to instill fear into you.
0/-1	These doctors are eugenicists. Psycopaths.
0/1	These doctors should be applauded for standing up for the people!!!! The title should be "doctors for early treatment ".
0	These guys were strong and manly before they had their experimental mRNA shots.
0/0	These include the claim that the genetic material in the vaccine will find its way into your DNA permanently.
0/0	These jabs are not needed not safe not ethical, prove otherwise and kindly stop referring too PCR results as infections, cases or a clinical diagnosis
1/1	These magats on twitter are saying they‚Äôll never sleep with someone who gets the vaccine and I‚Äôm just over here being incredibly thankful for the amazing surprise side effect!
1/0	These may cure cancer. I am grateful to all the people who are taking this experimental drug. Your helping the future. Awesome üëç
1/1	These new types of medicines, they are the future. mRNA / siRNA / DNA medicines will help us one day develop medicines to kill cancer cells safely and kill bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. The COVID19 virus was a blessing in disguise in that it triggered governments to get off their butts and remove a bunch of red tape and bs out of the way. It allowed researchers around the world to go into hyper drive essentially and develop this as quickly and safely as possible

It allowed researchers around the world to go into hyper drive essentially and develop this as quickly and safely as possible. A crap load of data has been generated and much more will come. We will probably save several years of research time on these types of medicines after all is said and done. I honestly think that ethics boards should go fly a kite. If someone wants to volunteer their life to the betterment of society and is of sound mind, then let them. It's our bodies. Tired of people constantly feeling like they get to dictate how everyone else should live because they "feel" a certain way.
0/0	These of course represent about 1% of side affects, according to the CDC, so imagine what real data would look like. Also, we are seeing only short term affects, what might the long term affects be? I say, screw these biologics, we have Ivermectin.
0/0	These people are eerily too excited about this. My family and I will pass.
1/1	These people are freaking out over a 1 in 1000000000 chance of getting a bad reaction to a vaccine but completely overlook the harmful effects of their lifestyle
0/0	These people playing God!
0/-1	These ppl should change there name to daily dose of vaccine
0/0/1/1/-1	These scientists who developed the vaccine are speedrunners
1/-1	These side effects are known and are a sign that your immune system is working.
0/0	These two guys are idiots or obviously paid by big pharma or are too scared to say the truth in case they get censored and banned. Anyway there is the answer about the vaccines safety. NOT SAFE VERY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	These two men, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe not one word they tell us. These two men are way to scripted, way to excited and way to happy about the vaccines.
0/0	These vaccinations need to be stopped right now.
0/0	These vaccine companies have ZERO liability for damage caused by their PRODUCTS. Let that sink in.
0/0	These vaccine's usually have bad reactions even when done patiently. This is rushed and I'm not a guinea pig.
0/0	These vaccines are Not Vaccines at all! We are Lied to at Every Opportunity.
0/0	These vaccines are all experimental....10 years is needed to properly test these drugs....until then everyone is guessing and using mistakes to change things...
1/1	These vaccines are awesome.
1/1	These vaccines are based on previous SARS virus work, so strictly speaking they have been in development for 17 years.
1/1	These vaccines are entirely safe and hey are effective, your family doctor will assure you of that .
1/1/1/1	These vaccines are entirely safe and hey are effective, your family doctor will assure you of that . There are sad anti vaxxers posting here some pretending to be medically qualified but pay them no heed,
0/1	These vaccines are experimental & should only be taken after consulting with your personal physician. Promoting the vaccine to the healthy 16+ population is irresponsible, at best! GET A 2ND PROFESSIONAL OPINION!
0/0	These vaccines are going to damage your RNA, turn your body in a GMO and may result in eventual organ failure!!
0/0	These vaccines are going to do so much damage to individuals and cause many deaths people need to do research in to what is really going on here.BIG PICTURE
0/0	These vaccines are in a testing phase, we are the subjects. This was "operation warp speed" -- So they rushed the vaccine years in advance, did no long-term testing as is standard with vaccines. We are test subjects, that's literally what is happening.
1/0	These vaccines are just for business and supremacy, stop playing with people's life!
0/0	These vaccines are not proven to be ‚Äòsafe and effective‚Äô. There is no way of knowing long-term side effects, though having looked into it, I would think these would include some sort of immunodeficiency disorder as well as infertility. Not surprising, since the main orchestrators wish to drastically reduce the world‚Äôs population.
0/0	These vaccines are not safe !!! To develop a safe vaccine, it takes many years .... not a year. Another thing is even Those companies like Pfizer not taking any responsibility for any side effects as they even can‚Äôt say what they are especially long-term side effects !!! In Europe is already many deaths and side effects after that of course it‚Äôs not after the vaccine they reckon !!!!! Stop this propaganda
1/0	These vaccines are not safe for anyone young or old.
0/0	These vaccines are not safe. I will not take one.
0/0/0	These vaccines are nothing but ways to subdue the population. Only god can cure the viruses of the earth put your trust in god not corrupted big governments.
1/1	These vaccines are safe
1/1	These vaccines are very well tolerated from the data we've seen
0/0	These vaccines do not have an excellent track record. They are new so there is no data. Further they are a type of vaccine that has never been used before
0/0	These vaccines have never been tested long enough to determine if they'll cause ADE or not
0/0	These vaccines may be modifying the genetic make up of the virus into new strains , instead of creating an actual immunity
0/0	These vaccines will do far more harm than good.
0/0	These vaccines will sterilize the person who receives it. That means you can't have any children. This is how the New World Order will meet the United Nations 2030 agenda to reduce the population. If this is what you want...then get the so called vaccine.
0/-1	These videos on the various vaccines aren't critical enough. And the conclusions are based on studies in the short term small sample sizes.
1/1	These were my exact side effects after second dose of Moderna! Mine didn‚Äôt really kick in as fast as yours, but took 24 hours of aches and pains to feel normal again. You‚Äôre absolutely right about enduring these effects any day over COVID. Definitely worth it and hopefully people aren‚Äôt scared off by a day of pain to avoid a potentially life altering (or ending) disease.
0/0	They Have NOT CURED The COMMON COLD VIRUS, NOR CURED The AIDS VIRUS, Why Should We Be DECEIVED TO Believe They Can Cure The COVID-19 Virus???
1/1	They already took it, so did healthcare workers.
0/0	They also cause bloods clots, permanent disability and death.
0/0	They always point to the one in a million case to prove the case for the vaccine ( I.e. 30 year olds), how about the cases of people who died shortly after getting the vaccine you never hear about those as a reason not to get it.
1/1	They are RIGHT! Healthcare workers over the WHOLE WORLD should have top priority.
0/0	They are all under trial for 2 years yet so I‚Äôll wait thanks. They have absolutely no clue how the vaccines work with so many conditions and other medications. They still don‚Äôt even have enough data to declare they are 100% safe re human fertility! Covid is no threat to most
1/1	They are all very effective, so timing becomes the way to measure what is best. Sooner = better.
1/-1	They are and they have been for some time. A coronavirus vaccine will be part of the annual ‚Äòflu jab‚Äô from now on.
0/0/0	They are basically seeing who is stupid enough to take it, those are the ones that can be controlled.
1/1	They are clearly trying to skew data to emphasize their points. If the US has rolled out more vaccines than any other country than what does percent vaccinated to population matter?! Israel‚Äôs population is 1/36th our population, of course they‚Äôd have a higher percent vaccinated. Why have more white Americans received the vaccine? Because the first wave was directed towards healthcare workers, teachers, and law enforcement. The majority of people in those career fields are white, which explains why they would have higher vaccination numbers at this point in time. This is propaganda, plain and simple
0/-1	They are concern.only with their profit!!
0/0	They are dying because of the vaccine
0/0	They are effective at messing up your genetics and health permanently.
1/1	They are effective.
0/0	They are forcing people to get this vaccination, whether directly or indirectly by not allowing intl travel without the vaccine is still force. Can you say mark of the beast?!
0/0/0	They are funding their own studies...all bs.
0/0	They are going to enforce vaccines the same way the made masks mandatory, thats why we as the people should LEAVE AMERICA, start our own society with our own laws. They are experimenting on us like we‚Äôre their lab rats.. and all for what in exchange? Continuous grunt work to pay off this unpayable debt the U.S government put us in? All on top of that more debt like college and taxes being created and placed to be payed first before that 50 trillion dollar debt, therefore making this debt damn near impossible to pay off. this is all a political game these psychopaths in power play and have been playing for over 200 years, it‚Äôs time we actually wake up and we do something because peaceful protests don‚Äôt work.
0/0	They are going to have separate states for vaccinated and non-vaccinated. I will be in non-vaccinated state.
1/1	They are incredibly safe, so there's on absolute safety in anything in life.
0/0	They are literally gonna kill off half the population and shrug it off with this corona virus vaccine

0/0/0/0/0	They are not FDA approved!!! Not getting anything that is not FDA APPROVED!!!
0	They are not a vaccines, they are experimental gene therapy.
0/-1	They are not responsible if something goes wrong with this experiment. Hell no. Give it to the elites. Don't hire someone and with technology make it appear as if they're taking it. No lawsuit no monkey suit
0/0	They are not safe and my friends wife is proof. After her second shot. Her kidneys were shutting down. She had a bad reaction to the shot and was in the icu because of it. Be careful people. Main stream media isn't telling the whole story.
0/0	They are not safe for anyone. These are experimental mRNA vaccines that have already killed or maimed large numbers of people around the world. If you take these vaccines, you are serving as a laboratory rat for pharmaceutical companies that are making $$$Billions and face absolutely no liability for adverse reactions, including death.Furthermore, these vaccines are not necessary, since there are old (off-patent and therefore cheap), safe and effective medications like Hydroxychloroquine+zinc+azithromycin or Ivermectin.Do your research before you get these dangerous experimental vaccines, which, among other things, may cause infertility.

0/0	They are safe for no one.
0/0	They are synthetic EXPERIMENTAL INJECTIONS. Wake the hell up people.
0/-1	They are trying blame brith control and not the vaccine. Brith control has always come with a risk of blood clots. But the problems with J&J are different in scoop. It‚Äôs not the brith control. They know this but wait you to look else where.
0/0	They are trying to kill us, don't take the vaccine!
0/0	They are tryna kill us wit the vaccine
0/0	They are using "anti-Vaxxer" as a tool to divide humanity. Those who do not have the ability to think will slander those who have worked it out. Why is the Guardian protecting Big Pharma "serial-Killers"? How much have they been paid to attack those who are not prepared to be slaughtered over something that has not been proven? The Guardian has not provided evidence that sar.s co.vid 2 exists.
0/0	They are volunteering for vaccines for getting off loans... We know where we failed
0/0	They aren't safe yet for anyone. Criminally negligent at best you lot.
0/0/0/0/0/0	They aren't telling you about all the deaths caused by this vacs
0/0	They ate also using nursing home residents for medication and vaccine trials. My mother was one of those elderly people with dementia that did not understand what was going on. The POA allowed it. :(
0/0	They came out with 4 types of vaccines like they dropped a new clothing line or something. Lol
0/0	They can find a cure for covid within a year but can‚Äôt find a cure for cancer(s) .. I think I‚Äôll pass.
0/0	They can go to hell with their vaccine and I will NEVER EVER take it.
0/0	They can go to hell with their wicked vaccines.
0/0/0	They can have mine, I won‚Äôt take that.
0/-1	They can have mine. I am a Senior an don't plan to use one.
0/-1	They can have mine. I don't want it. My body my choice.
0/0	They can have my dose.
0/0	They can have my dose. I don‚Äôt want that crap.
0/0	They can inject you with more experimental vaccines to see what they do to you. Scientists love to experiment on people.
0/0	They can keep that garbage vaccine, I am not taking it at all period!!
0	They can keep that poison
0/0	They can keep their manmade concoctions... I‚Äôd rather stick to my God-given immune system.
0/0	They can keep their vaccine
0/0	They can now see into the future and know the long term effects. Amazing!
0/0	They can only demand it if it's safe and effective AND ITS NOT
0/0	They can program that mRNA vaccine to do all kind of shit in our bodies beside killing the covid virus.
1/1	They can protect us from illness.
0/0/0	They can stick the vaccine up their fucking arse... I AIN'T FUCKING HAVING IT MATE!
0/0	They can stick their experimental vaccines in their own arms.
0/0	They can stick their needle where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine. I am not taking the VACCINE
0/0	They can stick them vaccines up their barrels!!
0/0	They can take that vaccine n put it up their?? I refuse, I will not take it.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	They can take that vaccine n put it up their?? I refuse, I will not take it..
0/0	They can try to tell me that the didn't cut any corners making these vaccines all that they want. I didn't belive them and here we are.
1/1	They can't blame vaccines on their kid's autism. It's a genetic disorder. A vaccine is literally a weakened form of the virus suspended in liquid to create memory cells in your immune system. The sickness in your kid is the body's natural response. If you could please your last two brain cells, and see actual Doctor, and maybe educate yourselves. Because now we got measles coming back, and I guarantee you guys aren't helping AT ALL
0/0	They cannot force you to have anything because that is against your human rights, they can highly advise you to have it or try & black mail you into having it but they cannot force it upon you
0/0	They can‚Äôt make a cure to AIDS or herpes ext. yet they create a COVID vaccine less then a year!! Yea Righhhtt.
0/0	They can‚Äôt possibly know the long term side effects are there hasn‚Äôt been enough time or study on the vaccine or the possible reactions to other meds or diseases .
0/0	They care so much that they are willing to kill us all in order to save our lives! :p
1/1	They caught it before the vaccine took effect. You need the booster shot 3 weeks later before it works. You can‚Äôt catch corona virus from the vaccine. Vaccine only has mRNA, not the virus.
1/1	They complain about wearing masks, their rights are being taken away, however they will not do the right thing to get back to normalcy! Hopefully the majority of us do the right thing and get the vaccine! We have to in order to get back to normalcy!
1/1	They could create ads informing people to get vaccinated.
0/0	They could if they wanted to, they have a license to kill with this vaccine.
1/1	They could inject me with dog piss right now if it would protect me from Covid. I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to be vaccinated very soon and I won‚Äôt care what brand is in the syringe. I just want the #vaccine. I don‚Äôt have any concerns about clots or vaccine brands
0/0	They couldn‚Äôt kill us with the GMO food so now they‚Äôre going to try this !
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	They couldn‚Äôt pay me to take this poison.
1/1	They develop a new flu vaccine yearly. This isn't developing a vaccine from the ground up, we know how to do it now. It's like saying you wouldn't fly on a new jet because it took the Write brothers 6 years to figure out flight.
1/1	They did the president now took it hes ok so did obama
0/1	They don't chase these ppl down to give them food or water. Only vaccines.
1/1	They don't vaccinate to make you sick they vaccinate to keep you from getting sick
0/0	They don't work. Merck (one of the vaccine manufacturers) has said it's better to get the virus and recover from it than to take the vaccine.
0/0	They don‚Äôt know the affect of it down the line. Not for me.
0/0	They don‚Äôt like how populated we are. They want to force vaccines so our unborn children won‚Äôt have functioning reproductive organs.
0/0	They don‚Äôt need vaccines. They need healthy immune systems.
0/0	They don‚Äôt protect you. They kill you. End of discussion.
1/1	They don‚Äôt talk about the huge distribution problem of mRNA vaccine. That vaccine needs -70C freezer for storage. On the other hand, astrazeneca only needs 4C and is way more cheeper to produce.
0/0	They even say on the FDA fact sheet for the Moderna vaccine that they don‚Äôt know the duration of the protection. How can you even evaluate whether it‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt know how long it will be useful for? If you just read the information they are publishing about these vaccines as a rational person, it is hard to understand the justification for taking them.
0/1	They go for this vaccine because they think its safe and because they're made to think that they need it! I know ppl that want it even after i explain what's in it and the side effects! I've been called selfish because i wont have it and I'm putting others at risk!
1/1	They got infected from someone not the vaccine. The first vaccine only introduces the virus to the body and allows the body to fight it off. That‚Äôs when the body attacks the virus. 21 days after, you get the second vaccine and that will decrease the chance of contracting the virus by 95%.
0/0/0	They got the vaccine huh? Man that sucks for them
0/0	They have NO IDEA of the long term side effects of these mRNA vaccines as they freely admit.
0/0	They have been trying for years to get a decent vaccine for flu and the common cold, nothing works so far. Why a vaccine for an illness that can be prevented by a decent level of vitamin D and zinc.
0/0/0/0	They have been working on coronavirus vaccines for years. They have never been successful. Suddenly successful?
0/0/0/0/0	They have blood clots in their brain?! It‚Äôs a NO for me.
0/-1	They have compromised themselves when they hid the truth of this pandemic from us.
0/-1	They have doubts as to whether the vaccines are actually safe, given the rapid pace of development, and whether possible side effects have been adequately studied.
0/0	They have nano bots in them
0/0	They have no idea what the long term effects are. I choose to increase my immune system naturally
0/0	They have not followed the same testing guidelines as a FDA approved vaccine. As a matter a fact animal studies were skipped in many of these ‚Äútrials‚Äù.
0/0	They have not had enough time for trials. Count me out
0/0	They have to catch me first !!
0/0/0/0	They haven't been tested on animals human beings are the Guinea pigs. This is all lies no one trust who anymore.
0/0	They inject you future mutations..let us see where that leads to the ones that took it
0/0	They is some hidden agenda on this demonic virus, why explain the way they make these vaccines, it's about time we run to Jesus and repent our si a brothers and sisters
0/0	They just DONT know how safe and effective it is long term. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs most concerning to me. Long. Term. Effects.
0/-1	They just getting flu shots
0/0	They just had a person died this week from that vaccines. It was just on the news this week
0/0	They just want to pretend good reason to include kids for the injections; which we‚Äôve all predicted they would do once they realized a huge percent of adults didn‚Äôt want the injections and that they would lose billions over it. They‚Äôre trying to stretch these as far as they can.
0/-1	They just want to put chips in you
0/0	They keep saying every person in America ummmmm not me bc I just don‚Äôt know how I feel about it I don‚Äôt even like getting the flu shot
0/-1	They like to tell us the reason for something is one thing when it really exists for a totally different reason. Like they say abortion gives women a choice but it‚Äôs really depopulation
0/0	They love the "Anti Vaxxer" tag. If someone doesn't want to take vaccines based on knowledge they have required then what's the problem? Surely it's about being pro safe, and the fact is this vaccine has not been proven to be safe. I've had many vaccines but I will not be having this one.
0/0	They lying dont take it
0/0	They made it to fast im no goofy i new this would happen take that vaccines turn it side ways and stick it up you candy the rock finish it off for me
0/0	They made this chaos to give them something to save us from
0/-1	They make it seem like everybody wants it. By the looks of the 10k plus comments in every video I've seen nobody wants it. Goverment will save alot of money
0/0	They managed to survive Covid, but not the vaccine. R.I.P.
0/0	They market this stuff in a sneaky way to make you want it. I can‚Äôt be tho only person that can see through this trickery??
0/0	They might as well just line people up and literally pull the trigger. This is flat out murder without the bullets but yet instead in a liquid form.
0/-1	They need to ship out money before they ship out a vaccine
0/0	They need to stop using all of them, until they have been completely & totally approved in accordance to the approved requirements for all previous drugs.
1/0	They need to widely promote and show the results of all tests and studies of the vaccine. Like spend hours on tv and social media showing it. If it‚Äôs positive people may change their minds
0	They never had a vaccine for any other corona virus. Dont seem them succeeding now. Even if their is one, Ill pass. And Ill pass on the flu shot, like I do every year.
0/0	They never isolated the alleged first strain. Why should we believe there is a new strain? Viruses don't exist. The "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise. Wake up!
0/0	They only make the vaccines for money, they don't even work
1/1	They r freaking out for no reason whatsoever. Birth control has 1 in 1000 chance to develop clots whereas the vaccine 1 in 1000000. Yet we use birth control. THE RISKS OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS!
0/0	They really think they‚Äôre businesses are more important than peoples lives??? Boycott all businesses requiring mandatory vax and they will see you has the power
1/-1	They recently announced that they're looking at using the same technology to treat MS with a vaccine. What a time to be alive.
1/1/1	They say that the definition of luck is when preparation meets opportunity. By that definition, we certainly were "lucky". Kudos to generations of scientists! And this video is magnificently written.
0/0	They say the benefits outweigh the risks.....yeah, tell that to the 19 people who survived a whole year of the covid outbreak but died from getting the vaccine
0/0	They say the corona virus will kill you if you are old and have underlying conditions. That you are to stay inside and wear a mask when you do go out. Then they develop a vaccine in record time which basically gives you the corona virus to stimulate anti bodies. In conclusion they are killing you with a vaccine.
0/1	They say there is no science to back that it may cause infertility. What they don‚Äôt tell you is there is no science to back it up that it won‚Äôt cause infertility since they skipped/rush the development and production.
0/1	They seem like they're not really into anything what science say mostly leave in all the rumors from the web on vaccines and their are teens standing up against their own parents that are anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated.
0/0	They should be hesitant. Everyone should be
1/1	They should define a point at which enough people are vaxxed and all restrictions are ending. Bc you are wright, otherwise ppl will stop to take the vacc. What for? If everything stays, they will not comply...
0/0	They should have a cartoon of the daughter of that young mother who died after the vax...putting flowers on her mother's grave.
1/1	They should have as many factories as possible make the vaccine
0/0	They should have been tried long ago. From the illegal curfews to now the killer vaccines. Kenyans are timid to let these crooks get away to murder
1/1	They should not be called anti vaxxers They are pro-disease
1/-1	They should pay people for each vaccination.
0/0	They should take this off the market. I‚Äôm not taking this one nor is my family.
0/1	They started rolling this out at our hospital in January... The 2nd shot made a lot of people sick. I have chosen not to get it.
0	They sure are, but we still don't want it, no matter how much they want us to worry that it's in short supply! If it wasn't crimes against humanity and criminal, it would be laughable just how low they are stooping to try to trick us.
0/0	They testing the vaccine on the sick and elderly, if they die it‚Äôll be considered just another covid death
1/1	They think the Public health experts are exaggerating (even in details). These people want to learn the hard way through experiencing yet another surge.
0/0	They think their only solution is a vaccine and they get paranoid if they don‚Äôt have a vaccine for every virus and infectious desease.
0/0	They told us lead paint , tephlon frying pans, thalidomide, mercury fillings and a million other things were safe too.
1/0	They told us, you can still get it, it just won't be as severe. But people always hear what they want to hear
0/0	They want a CASHLESS SOCIETY and DIGITAL ID's for everyone, vaccine passports will transition to digital id's. I said this months ago and you all cried the "tin foil hat" line. Next they will want to vaccinate your children to get them "in the system" early. That's what it's all been about.
0/0	They want depopulation to start as soon as possible.
0/0	They want to Gene edit the human race. Mark my words
0/0	They want to be richer, they don't care about the people.
0/0	They want to force something that has not been proven to be anymore effective at stopping transmission than wearing a mask and social distancing, which all of a sudden are not "safe" enough now.
0/0	They want to force something that has not been proven to be anymore effective at stopping transmission than wearing a mask and social distancing, which all of a sudden are not "safe" enough now...
0/0	They want to replace our innate immunity with some thing that can be controlled and manipulated
0/0	They want us to change into zombies
0/0	They want you to have the vaccine because it has a tracing cell in it which they want everyone to have.
0/0	They way vaccinated people carry on when you tell em your not getting a shot is crazy af lmao like relax... I‚Äôm convinced that vaccine is making folks a lil cray cray
0/0	They will NEVER get me to take that vaccine
0/0/0	They will be blaming the virus for people dying from the vaccine
0/0	They will be exempt from liability.. do not get that vaccine
1/1	They will distribute the high risk people vaccines first. Get the vaccine if you can.
0/0	They will never admit it was their vaccine. They have millions of doses they want to inject into us. Besides, the underlying reason for this vaccine is not for the bogus COVID, but for population control.
1/-1	They will refuse because it‚Äôs something to refuse and be against.. nothing more
1	They will survive it I had mine no side effects at alk
0/0	They won't tell you how many have died or had bad side effects from the vax will they?
1/1	They work
0/1	They'll have to give it to me kicking and screaming
0/0	They're all pseudoscience pushing eugenics
0/1	They're determined to stick that devil's brew in to us all, may the gods protect us all üëç
0/0	They're even warning people about the side effects, people still think it's safe to take and forcing others to be sheep's with them pfft.
0/0	They're never jabbing that stuff in my arm ... it isn't a cure anyway
0/0	They're not vaccines...according to the CDCs definition...they're NOT approved by the fda...they're synthetic..they're experimental gene therapy...you ppl are Guinea pigs
0/0	They're playing you for fools, folks. Walk away.
0/0	They're still garbage vaccines with ZERO longterm data.
0/0	Theyll shove us full of illegal, "covid positive" immigrants until they get their fear so deep everyone gets their vaccines... if covid is sooooo bad where are the homeless deaths... why are we trucking in 1000s of illegals a day and releasing them after they test positive lol
0/0	Theyre doing it on tv so the sheep will say i saw mr. so and so do it live on tv! They couldnt fake it! Its safe! We wouldnt fake injecting the real poison into our bodies. Shame on all of them. Both sides of the bird. What a let down these self appointed leaders are. Just cuz you enter a ballot doesnt mean it gets counted fairly. Rothschild said give me control over a nations currency and i care not who is in charge. 100% rigged illusion of choice.
0/0	They‚Äòre not coming near me with that vaccine! We should have a choice.
0/0	They‚Äôll probably be reluctant to take a vaccine which has been created in a year when it normally takes decades to make sure they are safe and if you aren‚Äôt worried about the safety of it then that‚Äôs odd
0/0	They‚Äôll probably eventually suggest to vaccinate once a month for everyone to be really safe
1/1	They‚Äôre all 100% effective at keeping you out of the hospital.
0/0	They‚Äôre all psychopaths working for #BillGates the biggest psychopath of them all. Don‚Äôt say vaccine to save lives, say vaccine for profits & control. Speak the truth!
0/0	They‚Äôre already recalling the Johnson and Johnson vaccine but y‚Äôall wanna tell me to get it. Lmao tf y‚Äôall are SHEEEEEEEEEPPPPP
0/0	They‚Äôre just advertising free slow killing lethal injection
0/0	They‚Äôre made in India with dirty water no thanks
0/0	They‚Äôre setting aside 1.2 million vaccine doses for people who are being redosed in...July? Spare us the Horse facePile of poo. Most Ontarians aren‚Äôt this credulous, sucks for you.
1	Things are clicking! 1. A vaccine that works ‚úì 2. A monoclonal antibody EUA ‚úì 3. A coronavirus task force ‚úì 4. Leadership that believes in and is guided by science ‚úì
0/0	Things come apart so easily when they have been held together by lies
1/-1	Things keep ramping up. More than 10% of the population has been given their first shots in Biden's first two weeks. I'm going to Europe in the summer, baby! It's almost over!
0/0/0/0	Think I'm going to pass on the first / second decade of covid 19 vacines.
0/0	Think about it, a company created 10 years ago...has never had anything approved ever is pushing a vaccine for a pandemic. If that doesn‚Äôt set off the fire alarm I don‚Äôt know what else could
1/1/1	Third day after my second vaccine. So far so good!
0/0	This ""vaccine"" is nothing short of a big ugly joke
0/0	This "Dr" has been a huge CV19 shill since the beginning! I watched him at first and believed he is here to help, very soon realized he is a pharma sellout!
1/1/1/1	This Astra Zeneca vaccine have more benefits than its side effects the most discussed is clotting in some patients and 7 deaths related it. The people with certain age groups and existing comorbidities might be candidates of clotting but not always everyone life threatening. Vaccine should be continued to be taken accordingly. It is responsibility of the people to take care of their other health issues too so alongside vaccine strictly followed SOPs will minimize the the danger. Let‚Äôs hope for the better
1/1	This COVID Vaccine works
1/1	This COVID-19 is no joke. Please take maximum possible precautions which include wearing masks, personal hygiene, physical distancing, keeping indoors as much as possible, and taking the available vaccine when possible.
0/0	This RNA technology is new. "Hydrogel technology" means nanotechnology. So if you got the vaccine remember that you are taking part in a experimental and new treatment .
0/-1	This Vaccine matter has been more a Commercial/Political activity than subject matter medical research !
0/0	This Witch is lying look at the swollen tongue Guy that had the vaccine
1/1	This all seems very promising and hopefully we really can be back to normal by Spring.
0/0	This alone makes me never want to get it
1/1	This anti-vaxxer at work told me I would no longer be able to have babies anymore after getting the covid vaccine and I looked her in the eyes and said ‚Äúso it‚Äôs a 2 for 1?‚Äù
0/0/0	This are still early stages for side effects, give it five years
1/-1	This bridge is 99.997% safe, best not use it in case it fails
1/1	This bridge is only 99% safe so we should just swim in the shark infested water
1/1	This cannot be understated - these #CovidVaccines prevent severe disease, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions, reducing #COVID19 to a manageable illness while preserving healthcare capacity and function.
1/-1	This certainly puts vaccine issues into perspective. Thank you for the clarity
0/0	This chemical vaccination TAKES lives as well as 'saving' them. Very long odds, you say, but the axe has to fall somewhere, perhaps it'll be you. Not me though, I want to stay alive and healthy, so somebody else can have my chemicals.
0/0	This citizen of rural area DOES NOT want the experimental drug
1/-1	This comment field makes me sick. I sure hope the real world has a more sober view on science‚Ä¶
1/-1	This comment section is proof that our education systems have failed.
0/0	This commercial has been brought to you by Pharma Inc.
0/0	This company willingly poisoned us. I‚Äôll never take this
0/0	This confirmed my decision I made a while ago...I'm not taking !
1/1	This convinced me to take the vaccine.
1/1	This coronavirus vaccine news is tremendous! An effective and safe vaccine would save thousands of lives and give us a path back to normalcy. Go science!!
0/0	This country is not to be trusted when rolling out anything in such a short time.
0/1	This covid will never end. My arm still hurt from the Pfizer vaccine
0/0/0	This days the government cannot be trusted because if you have fever or flue they will just say you have covid...
1/-1	This definitely makes me feel better about my side effects after getting the vaccine. Cause wow I've been tired.
0/0	This doctor actually said here that he wasn't concerned about elderly dying after vaccination because they die anyways... Wow!
1	This doen't really make sense. What difference does it make if the testing took place during one peak vs another? Even if there are more people infected around, that shouldn't change anything. The vaccine should protect you regardless.
0/0	This dude is a gate keeper ! a mouthpiece for big pharma !
0/-1	This entire covit19 was to FORCE FLU VACCCINATE every human being on the planet as to get HERD IMMUNITY AGAINST A HEALTY LIFE
0/0	This entire pandemic was just to VACCINATE ALL OF HUMANITY for population control
0/0	This guy is a shill, only Jesus can save us NOT a vaccine.
0/-1	This guy is just saying not true\" \"not true\" without explaining why
0/0	This guy should be in jail the vaccine is killing people.
0/-1	This has been rushed. It seems as though its been a race to get the rollout done as quick as possible, as if its a competition. No thank you‚Ä¶
0/0	This has done absolutely nothing to persuade me to get this jab.
0/-1	This has got to be the biggest bamboozle in history.
0/-1	This has not been engineered to stop by vaccine!
0/0/0/0	This helped me decide that I will not be taking the experimental jab!! Thank you. !!
0/0	This hoax vaccine is simply a step towards population control. Wait a couple years and we'll really see the results...smdh...
0/1	This info won't matter much to the idiots out there afraid of a cold virus that kills less than 0.02% of its infectees. Encourage idiots to take the covid shots.
0/0	This is 1000% political bullshit. First they said it was 100% effective, and now that there are more virus variants, we suddenly have vaccine variants that were never announced?
1/1	This is GREAT another another weapon in this heinous pandemic now we don't have to depend on just one vaccine. A third vaccine would be awesome and probably on the way.
1/1	This is SO wrong. You should not give place to anti vaccines people. They do not have ANY scientific support so this is NOT BALANCED.
0/0	This is a RNA editing vaccine. That is an issue. I refuse it.
1/1	This is a clearly expressed and informative video about the process of ensuring that vaccines are safe. Reassuring to learn of the steps being taken. It does not seek to address the tiny number of adverse events that have occurred - and rightly so. That's for another video. Thank you WHO for working so hard - and I appreciate it's cumulative work built up over decades, not just a knee-jerk reaction to this particular pandemic.
0/0	This is a disgrace' promoting something that is not even a vaccine and is not tested and possibly not safe....... aghhhhhh
1/1	This is a good thing.
1/1	This is a historic, colossal achievement from both a medical innovation perspective and a logistics perspective. These massive efforts are supposed to be the sort of thing that central planning excels at, but it is very comforting to see America able to execute as well.
1/-1	This is a huge step for bioprocessing as a whole
0/0	This is a lie. This is the mark of the beast. Wake up people.
0/0	This is a mass experiment that should have been in a laboratory with animals & NOT ON PEOPLE
1/-1	This is a mistake for the history books. It's obviously going to cause more blood clots than it prevents - COVID makes clots a lot more often than one in a million. Where do you get off calling that "caution"?
1/1	This is a mistake. Literally a less than 1 in a million chance of a side effect but your pause will permanently convince several million of those "waiting to see" that they should never be vaccinated. Way more than one in a million of those people will die from covid.
1/-1	This is a multifactorial issue. It's not just one thing, and making it sound like it is does not help with vaccine confidence
0/0	This is a no brainer. AZ and J&J , both have been recalled & suspended due to blood clot complications. But we have a very stubborn govt led by filthy & greedy cartels. They don't care about saving lives. As far as they're concerned ; Money talks bulshit works.
1/1	This is a one in a million chance, and that don't even know if the vaccine caused it. You are twice as likely to be hit by lightning, that have a blood clot from the vaccine. Facts matter people, don't let the Trump hysteria scare you.
0/1	This is a plain and simple lie. 23 people in Norway died after the vaccine. Not from adverse reactions. They vaccinated the very elderly and some of them died. No evidence of death linked to the vaccine. Stop spreading dangerous disinformation.
1/0	This is a proper vaccine. Vaccines take a long time to develop for a lot of reasons, it doesn‚Äôt mean this one was rushed because it was done quickly.
0/0	This is a virus, regardless of the vaccine and the virus will never go away.
0/0	This is absolute lies. Friend of my got vaccines and got pretty sick. I do not believe in immunization. There is definitely side affect
1/1	This is absolutely brilliant. The result of many decades of work. Just at the right time. Science coming to the rescue. This should be made in a movie!
1/1	This is actually a valid question. So a vaccine doesn‚Äôt completely prevent a virus from infecting your body, but it helps your body develop what is called antibodies. And antibodies are created so that if that same virus were to infect you again, your body would have immunity built up against that virus, making you not fall as ill.
1	This is actually really smart. If she turns into a zombie, I‚Äôm pretty sure I can outrun a 90 year old zombie.
0/-1	This is all about compliance how far will you go to comply.
0/0	This is all by design. And you fell for it ! What is in the vaccine? You don't know ! You are sheep
1/1	This is all generally as predicted. Like with the flu jab, they‚Äôll be a new one released each year, except we will want a much higher percentage of the population to get it than the flu jab. If having a needle jabbed in my arm twice a year is the price for no more lockdowns, then I‚Äôm more than willing.
1/1/1	This is amazing! I had always thought they used the same traditional process!
0/-1	This is an EXPERIMENTAL vacine that has not been tested on animals 1st and you can still catch it and pass it on after taking the vacine,so you are the Guinea pigs wow
0/0	This is an advertisement!!!!!!
1/1	This is an amazing moment in history, a huge thank you to the scientists that made this possible! It's unbelievable that a virus that no one knew existed 12 months ago now not only has a vaccine, but a vaccine that is over 90% effective.
1/1	This is an amazing moment in history, a huge thank you to the scientists that made this possible! It's unbelievable that a virus that no one knew existed 12 months ago now not only has a vaccine, but a vaccine that is over 90% effective. And just as a cherry on top this new mRNA technology could produce effective vaccines to other deadly diseases in the near future. It's not an exaggeration to say this might be the biggest scientific achievement since the moon landings.
0/0	This is an experimental, untested gene therapy not a vaccine. Potentially reduces symptoms, has major side effects, doesn't stop you from getting sick, doesn't stop transmission, still have to wear a mask? For a condition with only 0.4% of "positive" cases being serious?!?
1/1	This is an unpopular opinion but make it mandatory.
1/1/1	This is astonishing stuff. There is always some good that comes out of a shitty situation and I think the good that we will get from this pandemic is the advancement of pharmaceutical technologies. This could lead to the cures of so many diseases in the future including cancer!
0/0	This is awful lot like the "educational video" in Jurassic Park explaining how dinosaurs are made...right before they start killing people.
0/0	This is bad! Vaccines r bad
1/1	This is big news. This vaccine, unlike the ones from Moderna and Pfizer we actually have a shot at producing locally. I'd be interested to know if that big order from the government comes with a contract production rider

0/0	This is bull sh*t !!! IT'S NOT A VACCINE.... IT'S POISON !! Give it to the politicians !!
0/0	This is bullshit! The vaccine is there to kill us all
0/0	This is clandestine warfare. Fake a pandemic and frighten people enough so they accept taking a drug of dubious contents. When people start dying from the vaccine the government will say there‚Äôs a new strain of virus and push more drugs on the People. Wake up, folks, for your childrens‚Äô sake

0/-1	This is embarrassing, Germany comes out with the vaccine and oh sorry we did not order enough, by the way, screw parents we need to open schools?
0/0	This is exactly the reason I won't get the vaccine. Were the pharmaceutical companies just hoping to withhold it if president trump was re elected?
0/1	This is exactly why I am not getting this so call vaccine. Wait until months or years to see what it does... don‚Äôt think so!! Wake up people

1/1	This is first time that I will not be scared of getting corona vaccine injection
1/0	This is for all my breastfeeding/pumping mamas out there. Early data support our breastmilk DOES contain IgA & IgG antibodies following #COVID19 vaccination.
0/0	This is for your safety, said the SS Officers as they loaded the prisoners onto the box cars.
1/1	This is good news to the world. Kudos to those brilliant minds.
1/1	This is good news. The point isn't that the vaccine produces an immune response, that was known already, the point is that it also produces an immune response in older people, at least at a sufficiently high rate.
1/1	This is good news. The sooner that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves it, the better.
1/1	This is good to hear. Maybe after this we should preemptively look for other pandemic viruses and figure out vaccines for those before they start.
1/1	This is good, but this one is less effective than Moderna. I hope I don‚Äôt get stuck with the Johnson and Johnson vaccination.
1/-1	This is good.
1/1	This is great but the vaccine is not available for everyone as you know. My father is over 65 with a compromise immune system and he still waiting. In the meantime he still goes to work at one of the DC government agencies as he is required to be there.
1/1	This is great news and Hopefully this will be executed as soon as possible and quickly distributed to all ... so everyone will have some chance of normality back in their lives in the new year . Hopefully this will enable companies, shops, tourism, leisure , hospitality sectors, schools, etc ....and all our economy to get saved and slowly get back to normal. Plus our hospitals have a chance to breathe as they all have worked soo incredibly hard ...... over the past year with this awful Pandemic ...
1/1	This is great news that vaccines will be out soon! Pharmaceutical innovations can be believed. Can‚Äôt wait to get one
1/1/1	This is great news! I‚Äôm a conservative Catholic. I got the vax.
1/1	This is great news. Of the 75,000 people who received the vaccine in a controlled study, NOT ONE PERSON has died of covid and very few have been hospitalized.
1/1	This is great, especially since I'm supposed to be getting my shot. üëç
1/1	This is great, hopefully less cases and death will be reported as more people get vaccinated
1/1	This is great. What's the name of the vaccine? And I'm guessing the human trials went great? That's why it got approved and being used on humans now

1/1	This is interesting. Without a depth of education to understand the details with vaccines in this document but I have a thought as a person who generally trusts vaccine efficacy with my physician. Where I am curious is the correlated possibilities of the current measles vaccine as-is as something which already has been a booster. Could it be children, already vaccinated with measles, are possibly why we already have been seeing children/youth less affected by C19? Having a fair education and using a metaphor, I do understand each vaccine is its own unique ‚Äòkey‚Äô and effective in its individual way. Is the measle virus that similar as Covid it was already defending youth? Or have we seen unvaxed measles children respond similarly as vaxed? That is if say the measles vaccine is ‚ÄúATACAA...‚Äù and the C19 vaccine is ‚ÄúATAGAA...‚Äù could those similarities been close-enough to have been the trigger people‚Äôs immune reactions? I‚Äôm not asking rhetorical questions here to prove/push an agenda; just a curious set of thoughts.
1/1	This is it, the end of the dark times
0/0	This is just a fishing op, btw, see if they can get a rise, resist as best you can, there are plenty of good people still: we are many, they are few!
1/1	This is just brilliant. Now we need the public to step up and have the vaccination, the higher the uptake the lower number of cases and more normality for everyone
1/1	This is just my experience. I am NOT trying to scare anyone or discourage anyone from getting the vaccine. A few side effects are normal but I now feel perfectly fine (1 day after getting the vaccine) üòä you would rather experience a day or two of vaccine side effects than possibly lose your life to COVID or spread it to a loved one.

1/0	This is mere statement of Opinion. Provide actual SCIENTIFIC FACTS that prove, scientifically, thst the vaccines dont work or are "bad". Provide it. Thats right - you cant. Youre not educated in this field of knowledge. Its easier for you to spew opinion over facts because doing medical research takes actual Work and effort. It requires critical thought. Which over 72 million americans dont possess.

1/1	This is not a race between humans, it is a race against the Virus.I sincerely hope all the vaccine listed in here will help us beat the virus.
1/1	This is not a simple cold/flu virus. Even those that recover from it have debilitating residual chronic effects. You're far safer with the vaccine even if it didn't work at all. It is not just to save your life but to preserve your quality of life. One example is that people who have suffered CoViD has lost significant lung functionality. It is like they have been smokers their entire life. If you suffer from that it is like having COPD and oxygen tanks for life. If the vaccine protected you against just that alone it would be worth it. Yet there are other debilitating effects like blood clots whether in limbs, brain, or heart. You may survive without the vaccine, but who wants to be among those suffering from effects needlessly.
0/1	This is not a vaccine It‚Äôs a killing machine

1/1	This is not the time to be a baby about getting the shot. I got my first COVID shot this morning. My arm does not even hurt. I have seen people moan and fuss over a splinter. Get over it. This is new. I got that. Whatever the side effect is, it is small potatoes compared to what the COVID virus will do to you. You bet I rolled up my sleeve for this shot.
0/0	This is one of those examples where the vaccine could be worse than the disease.
0/0	This is parroting, thats what they told you. No ones gotten their hand on the substance so no one knows exactly what it's programmed to do, so you can not be sure. This started with fears of a virus (alleged virus), then restrictions (decimation and total control). They told us, a vaccine would reverse all of this. It's not doing any of that. We know that for sure.
0/0	This is poison
1/1	This is precisely why it‚Äôs important to get vaccinated. The vaccines prevent hospitalization and death.
0/0	This is propaganda for a vaccine that is neither needed, nor safe. I don't like it!
0/0	This is propaganda, several thousand have died, as many thousands have had allergic reaction.
1/1	This is really fantastic news for all you that will be having it. Hope it brings you the security you need to start living your lives again.
0/0	This is repulsive. I will NOT be getting this toxic crap. I'm not an idiot
1/-1	This is ridiculous. To start with, the largest studies dispelling the MMR vaccine-autism "link" are not even American, but Scandinavian, so even if an American organisation fiddle with the data to "cover up" things, there are plenty of other studies that explore the potential link between MMR and autism and find there is none. The only one study that does find a link is the Wakefield study, with was retracted due to being fraudulent. Also, I'd like to gently remind everyone re. graphs that correlation does NOT equal causation. The apparent rise in autism is disputed too. There is a rise in autism DIAGNOSES, but then a lot of things that were previously diagnosed as retardation or childhood psychosis or (in the Asperger end of the autism spectrum) not diagnosed at all, is today diagnosed as autism spectrum disorders. Also, please just cut it and wake up from the Antivaxxer conspiracy. The impacts of not vaccinating children due to the fictive MMR-autism link cause serious harm in society, such as vulnerable people (babies, old, sick) suffering and dying from preventable diseases, and people with immune deficiencies having to avoid others and live in fear because they can no longer trust that they are protected by the general societal herd immunity, as it is slipping under the minimum required proportions for a number of severe, once eradicated diseases. The MMR-autism myth is great material for epic drama, but the drama (like this movie) is responsible for a lot of real life tragedies that can easily be avoided.
1/1	This is ridiculous... tactic to scare people .. no positive evidence that the clots or death were directly attributable to the vaccine. With this fear tactic people will die of Covid by not getting the vaccine.
1/1	This is safest vaccine by miles, same principle as flu vaccine, other vaccines are first it's kind.
1/1	This is shocking ......hopefully the vaccine reduces these numbers
1/1	This is simply not true. It can be defeated with mass vaccination, contact tracing, and effective quarantines and testing. Multiple countries have proven the virus can be eliminated. Laziness is not an excuse.
1/1	This is so annoying. I had mine yesterday and yes aching and got the chills but the alternative is so much worse. Get the jab!
0/0	This is so bad. Moderna is a start up. They changed their name from ModeRNA. They don't have a single FDA approved medication. They have failed drug trials. They have never made a successful vaccine. ALSO! They are trying to invent a new mRNA vaccine that tricks, trains, triggers, your DNA. Never been done before. This is a company Bill Gates pushes. This is the conspiracy theories from Alex Jones coming true
1/1	This is so exciting to watch. Let‚Äôs hope life is on its way back to normal! And hopefully this will lead to no more covid deaths.
1/1	This is so frustrating! All-day long today all I have heard is people declining the vaccine over stuff like this or 'Because my friend's son's wife's best friend posted on Facebook that vaccines are bad' It's ridiculous how unwilling people are to protect themselves and others.
1/0	This is so incredibly irresponsible on a public health level. I‚Äôm sorry 6 women have had adverse side effects but you cannot tell me pausing rollout of millions of safe vaccines to an already hesitant population outweighs the crisis we‚Äôre facing. You‚Äôre doing so much damage.
0/0	This is so misleading. The vaccine is killing people. All lies
0/0	This is so sad to read the comments on so many reports like this one. People look what the mainstream media and our government have done to our faith. I along with so many don't believe anything anymore. Sad days ahead for the world I believe.
1/1/1	This is such a massive milestone to develop a Covid vaccine so quickly. Science is awesome.
1/1	This is such great news; the JJ vaccine is a boon for poorer countries who haven't even received any vaccines yet. Disparities abound and I'm relieved many tens of millions of people should start getting this vaccine 'soon'.
1/1	This is the beginning of the END. Please get your COVID vaccine! How cool that the nurse with the needle is my RA patient

1/1	This is the one I want when it's my turn. Great stuff.
1/1	This is the only way to get rid of COVID
1/1	This is the only way we can hope to get back to any sort of normality at all. Not very keen on all this negative feedback. We are all living with COVID it‚Äôs irrelevant where it started, what mistakes have been made we now all need to pull together and help each other. Then when we are ALL through this is the time all the other issues can be addressed.
1/1	This is the right thinking. The science is there. Being obese or even overweight does put you at risk. Listen to the guidance. If you are eligible do not double think, get vaccinated. The sooner we can get the majority of people vaccinated the better the system can help all those that do need it.
0/0	This is the same energy as "if random news anchor jumps off a bridge, would you do it too?" NO i will NOT. If you wanna be a clown and get the mark of the beast, that's on you. They need stop tryna force us and leave us alone! We don't consentüò†

1/1	This is what pushed me over the edge to get vaccinated NOW- knowing I can pass some protection on to my newborn baby. Otherwise, I probably would have held off a while and waited to see more data on the longevity of the protection, etc.
1/1	This is what we need in the vaccines - a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. If J&J can do it with one shot and at least extreme temperatures holdings this is great
1/1	This is what we need...factual information backed with science. Thank you, Doctor.
1/1	This is where I am a selfish bastard. I don‚Äôt care. When the vaccine is available, I will get it as soon as possible because I believe in the science behind it and believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
0/0	This is why I don‚Äôt trust these medical professional they know better yet even they allow us to be exposed. Glad I‚Äôm not there and if the ones in my hospital do the same I won‚Äôt go to them.
1/0	This is why I hate them: they'll prolong the pandemic by ensuring that the virus is never eradicated and allowed to continually mutate, perhaps causing us all to watch Covid The Sequel at some point in the future. Over half a million dead in a little over a year and these people still don't take it seriously.

1/1/1	This pandemic REALLY sucks on so many levels, but here we go with the third wave. There is hope with vaccines. We need to be super smart over these next few weeks to turbo mass vaccinate and all take necessary precautions. As hard as it is, this is truly our fastest way forwards.
1/1	This pandemic wont end as long as there's still people disseminating misinformation to avoid following public health policies and initiatives that can protect citizens against a deadly, mutating virus
1/1	This press conference convinced me to take a shot
1/1	This protects the whole population. If you're not taking it be ok witt not beeing allowed to access restaurants etc.
1/1	This really puts those numbers into perspective. And it's good to know that despite the difference in the numbers, each vaccine is safe enough to keep me away from the hospital or death.

1	This shows the limits of technology, record breaking vaccine creation, instant worldwide communication, other technologies like machine learning, mRNA, etc etc.. it all comes down to human cooperation and information
1/1	This sounds brilliant, a much better approach compared to growing more of a deadly virus and injecting it in a weakened state into people like we currently do.
1/1	This sounds terrible but for the greater good of society I believe that the risks of the vaccine, however terrible must be set to the side as we deal with the more prevalent issue of a virus that has disrupted the entire global economy and nearly everyone's daily life. It's a risk, but a risk we should be willing to take.
1/0	This sounds very inefficient and similar stories emerging with the Valneva jab. I really hope it become more organised quickly as we are all missing our families across Europe.
1/1	This statistics is not important. Accelerate vaccinations. Vaccinate all school children. Train more nurses to inject vaccine. Complete vaccine trials‚Ä¶
1/1	This technology is pretty cool, got my first dose a few days ago
0/0	This thing is radically different from any other. It modifies DNA, it was rushed through by people that have no liability and have been repeatedly found to knowingly use noxious substances. And they want to force it! The modification potential alone should make everyone run for the hills.

1/1	This vaccine has been tested and found to be acceptably safe and efficacious. If the blood clotting is linked to the vaccine I consider that to be an acceptable risk. The danger of death from COVID-19 is much greater.
0/-1	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it
0/0	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it @ this time
0/0	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it @ this time.
0/0/0/0	This vaccine hasnt been studied by anyone except Pfizer...Must be ok then!!
0/0	This vaccine is NOT SAFE. Don't believe the lies!
1/0	This vaccine is a death sentence. You would have to be a complete moron to get this death Jab! COVAIDS is a hoax. The people are awakening
0/0	This vaccine is a prion bio weapon. I also think prion bio weapons are being developed in other countries are going to use them in the following years. Anyone that knows what misfolded prion proteins are knows the scary terrible neurodegenetaive diseases that the proteins cause.
0/0	This vaccine is a weapon of mass destruction portrayed as a cure for another weapon of mass destruction.
0/0/0	This vaccine is an mRNA which changes your DNA makes you GMO. Don't take this s***
0/0	This vaccine is another garbage
1/1	This vaccine is at least very effective in stopping anybody from getting seriously ill. At the end of the day thats all is required At the end the of the day we are in lockdown only because of NHS pressure . If the vaccine can ease that then its more than enough
0/0	This vaccine is causing a false sense of security.
1/1	This vaccine is going to be game changer to the world even though it isn't as high an efficacy as the mRNA
1/1	This vaccine is needed for the mankind to live
1	This vaccine is not a silver bullet, but it's great news. We will still need to wear masks and practice social distancing for a while.
0/0	This vaccine is not determine as the solution of covid19...
1/1	This vaccine is our solution and our only chance..!
0/0	This vaccine is poison.
0/0	This vaccine is probably where the zombies come from!
0/1	This vaccine is still being TRIALLED, there is no data to state if there are any long term problems, no data to prove its efficacy past a few months, and the biggest problem is that it is a brand new TYPE of vaccine, never been used on humans BEFORE. Understand peoples concerns!
1/1	This vaccine is the same as for the common flu! Just take it folks!
0/0	This vaccine modifies some of your cells using synthetic RNA to make those cells produce a new protein. Long term effects of this are completely unknown, it is a brand new technique. Funnily most people won't eat GM food. So have you understood this and really thought it through.
0/0	This vaccine only took months...*months* to develop, not even a year. That's way too quick. Also, how do we know this isn't going to mess up someone's DNA? There's no transparency.
1/1	This vaccine seems very promising. I hope it works.
0/0	This vaccine should have never been pushed out!
1/1	This vaccine sounds brilliant, a much better approach compared to growing more of a deadly virus and injecting it in a weakened state into people like we currently do.
0/0	This vaccine was rushed, it's going to be unsafe handing out when it's only been about a year
0/0	This vaccine will alter your DNA wake up this is a depopulation event!!!!
0/0	This vaccine will alter your DNA. Don‚Äôt let the government put anything in your body. God gave you something called the immunity system. Give it what it needs such as elderberry and you‚Äôll be set.
0/0	This vaccine will be the end of us
0/0	This vaccine will create a new sub-species that the elite can easily control and harvest organs. The homo domesticated!
0/-1/0	This vaccine will cure the flu..just like the flu vaccine...oh but wait.....
0/0	This vaccine will either be a great triumph in responding to a pandemic, or a complete catastrophe or perhaps not even needed, nonetheless I'm not putting anything in my body until at least 10 years of research into this disease, the vaccine to test for its safety efficacy and is it really neccessary
0/0	This vaccine will kill more than corona
1/1	This vaccine works like birth control.
0/0	This vaccine's efficacy data is all over the place. Do not trust it.
0/0	This vaccine..wouldn't take it at the moment, seems too much like an experiment, could be unknown side effects and I'm not willing to explore those unless I really need to in order to travel for something very important and vaccination is mandatory.
0/0	This vaccinse is useless , ,,VERY DENGEROUS FOR EVERYBODY ,IF THEY WIIL NOT KILL YOU THE SAME DAY ,,,THEY KILL YOU LATER ....
0/0	This vacsine is a trap i ant taken it never. Been sick heard atack spose to help us
0/0	This very Vaccines will reduce half of the world population. Me and my family won't entertain this God forsaken act.
1/1	This video has only convinced me Pfizer is in fact much more effective. Thanks Vox
0/-1	This video is for Capital, not meant to inform people.
0/0	This video said absolutely nothing about the side effects.....what a waste of time.
1/1	This video somehow helps me change my mind. I honestly was scared and doubtfull about the vaccine but now I'm feeling pretty much secure about taking it...üòå
0/0	This video was excellent, it‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôve made the right choice on not getting the vaccine. Thank you for this :)
0/0	This virus is hurting 2% of the U.S. population. The flu also hurts people every year. People with weak immune systems should probably rethink getting the vaccine because of the virus strand. They should probably isolate all together until the epidemic is over if they want to make sure they live. They could also wait until their bodies are in better shape and then think of getting the virus.
1/1	This virus will decimate your immune system without the vaccine. That is the point in the vaccine my friend. It prepares you. Look at the vaccine trials. Every vaccine prevented death in 100% of cases. That‚Äôs no typo! Yes 100%.
1/-1	This warms my heart
1/1	This was easy and simple. Please get your vaccine when you can & if your eligible.
1/1	This was excellent. Shared and hoping the vaccine skeptics I know watch it.
1/1	This was great - thanks for uploading. Would love to see a simplified breakdown of the components and mechanisms of all the vaccines currently (and soon to be) in distribution worldwide. I think once people understand what's going on inside the vaccines, it would help quell any underlying fears they might have.
1/1	This was great, I cannot wait for this pandemic to end and we can go back to normal, def taking whatever is offered to me!
1/1	This was how my mom was, but once they got to her school (she‚Äôs a para) she signed up.
0/0	This was just a conspiracy theory some days ago (Certificate Of Vaccination IDentity) but now we clearly know the whole thing was to force the vaccine in peoples and later chip them to achieve the NWO evil agenda....
1/1	This was so valuable!! Thank you for this.
1/-1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears.
1/-1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears. Thank you Dr Strong
1/1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears. Thank you Dr Strongüëçüèæüíô
0/0/0	This was the only vaccine I was interested in because of no bad news. Now I'm not going to get any of the vaccines. All have been tainted and have had adverse reactions to people. I'd rather take my chances with the COVID.
1/1	This was very convincing. I m waiting for m turn for vaccination
1/-1	This was very helpful, thank you!
1/-1	This was very informative. I was very curious about this vaccine and a lot of my questions are answered. Thank you.
1	This week, I received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
0/0	This whole COVID-19 IS BS why we don't hear about the flu or any other deadly diseases anymore ALL ILLNESS ARE CONSIDERED COVID19 AND PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HOSPITALS they will kill you faster than a trigger happy police Bill Gates said years ago they are looking for a vaccine to control the world population NWO-NEW WORLD ORDER I just believe all this is for a greater plain of corruption handed down by all countries there is no vaccine for stupid
0/0	This whole comment section is filled with pro vax bots. Why is it so many getting mad at siaka for his opinions and on the other side praising the doctor, Nurse, and Teacher?
0/-1	This whole excercise has been handled appallingly (and late) by all governments and the various rushed-through vaccines represent blatant profiteering with no risk to the manufacturers. In addition, there are so many other disturbing and deliberately hidden stats including the huge amount of medical suffering endured by those who haven't been able to access 'normal' treatment.
0/0	This whole rushed process of less than one year development makes me question the legitimacy of the COVID-19 vaccine specifically. Not vaccines in general.
0/0	This whole thing in Russia was planned to implant microchips in their shots to track people. Not for the Virus itself. Russia... what can I say
0/-1	This whole thing is disgusting the vaccine is a scam. If they really wanted to stop this so call SARS 2 virus they would come up with something to stop it from getting into the cell
0/0	This whole thing is disgusting the vaccine is a scam. If they really wanted to stop this so call SARS 2 virus they would come up with something to stop it from getting into the cell, I hear Zinc, HCQ, VIT C and VIT D works very well. But instead this vaccine is a synthetic piece of the Virus protein put in a fat lipid so it can cross the cell membrane and GO INSIDE THE CELL. Makes no Fu(%ing sense. This virus should not be placed into our cellular structure it should be blocked from getting into the cell. The real Pandemic is how stupid people are.
0/-1	This whole thing is shrouded in corruption beyond belief
1/1	This will be burried in the comments, but I just got the vaccine the night before and feel awful. But I know science and my body are doing this on purpose and this video made me feel a lot better üíô
0/0	This will hurt us in the end. The longer it spreads the more chance of variants emerging. Thus u doing all the progress.
1/1	This will save lives, and help the economy
0/0	This would mean you‚Äôve isolated the virus, why don‚Äôt you show evidence of this or, well any virus existing?
1/1	This wouldn't be so bad if I could actually get the vaccine. I'm last in line.
1/0	This, and the DNA vaccines, create a platform that can be adapted to many other viruses in the future. Instead of a whole new vaccine being made, we can just take the sequence that codes for the sars-cov-2 spike protein, and swap it with a sequence that codes an important target of the next virus that threatens us.
0/-1	Thomas jefferson: "If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."
1/1	Those anti-vaxxiners think the rest of us are sheep but they tend to be the real MONKEYS!!..
1/-1	Those are the same 46% who thinks chocolate milks come from the brown cow
1/0	Those arguing that the fully vaccinated must wear masks and socially distance are the true anti-vaxxers, insinuating that vaccines do not work well. Surprising that the media spreads such anti-vaccine propaganda.
1/1	Those at risk from previously eliminated disease (eg Infants, Elderley and those with suppressed immune systems) are at risk of death - and the Anti-Vaxx movement are complicit in this for weakening our species' herd immunity.
0/0	Those in power seem to think we would believe every thing that comes out of there mouths .
1/1	Those not getting a vaccine, those not following public health orders and guidance, those trying to discredit science, those are the folks we have to thank for this never-ending pandemic.
0/0	Those of us who refuse this poison have been vindicated.
1/1	Those of you saying you won‚Äôt take the vaccine because ‚Äúyou do not believe it is safe‚Äù: get over yourself. Your beliefs do not override science and reality. Based on what we are seeing so far, the vaccine is safe. Granted, nothing in life is a 100 percent guaranteed, yet, those refusing to take the vaccine right now not because of reality-based evidence but because of some stupid ‚Äúbelief‚Äù, seriously?
1/1	Those saying they won't take it are the ones complaining we didn't have summer this year and the same will be for next year. Well done.
1/1	Those side effects look fine compared to the risk of my lungs being destroyed
1/1	Those side effects mean it's working. You're getting an immune system response as your immune system adapts to the newly introduced virus. It's worth feeling a bit crap for a day or two rather than having full blown diseases. I always have reactions to the flu jab, still get them every year
1/0	Those that want it WILL get it those that do not can roll over and die.
0/0	Those that will take the vaccine they are already dead stop trusting this shiiit vaccine rely on The lord for This solution any mere man cannot help the world
1/1	Those vaccines had the virus. Most of their danger was it could give you the disease because of this but were usually still better than getting the disease naturally. The first small pox vaccine was deadly but it was way better than a 60% fatality rate of getting small pox naturally. This vaccine and the next one do not contain the virus at all. Looking back on that is like saying I hope this banana doesn't taste like Apple because the last fruit I got did. It's biggest risk it does nothing for you or you have allergic reaction to its ingredients (not to the mRNA) which is something people allergies to vaccines will have to wait till it's studied more.
0/0	Those vaccines have NEVER been classed as safe for humans ..its a lie and the most dangerous experiment on humans ever in the history of Earth. They are not called vaccines by the makers called gene therapy !!!!!!!!!
1/1	Those who are not interested in taking vaccination should be kept in quarantine until the nation hit zero number of cases.
0	Those who get the poison are the experiment group; those who don‚Äôt are the control group. I‚Äôm staying in the control group.
1/1	Those who refuse the vaccine should walk around with a hat with a bell on it.
1/1	Those who refuse vaccination should be charged for medical treatment costs. It‚Äôs not fair to make taxpayers or insurance purchasers subsidize them.
0/0	Those who take the vaccine have to take it over with a boaster then an annual shot. Doesn't this resemble the Flu? Why would this last more years with you taking the vaccine? It makes no sense for this to carry on year after year. Go look up Covid Passport that has been planned since last May 2020. ID2020 is part of the Certificate of Vaccination ID. Have you heard about the Quantum Dot tattoo with Luciferase to track those who have the vaccine? Do you know about Patent 666 introduced in March 2020 which is a BG/Microsoft patent that will hook you up to the cloud with a Crypto Currency based on body activity. This CV passport sounds like the mark of the beast in the Bible.
1/0	Those who want the vaccine should take it.
1/1	Though DT and his cronies are doing a poor job in helping States get the vaccines out there it is happening! Get your vaccine when available!!!!!!! And wear your mask!
1/0	Thousands have died from Covid 19 after being vaccinated. All drugs can be dangerous. They must never be compulsory!!
0/0	Threaten me with prison time, millions in fines, suspend my driver license, etc: I wont even take a covid test. Go right ahead and experiment on the brainwashed, living in fear and the guinea pigs.
0/0/0	Three M.D.s I know very well, with much experience, have told me: "Do NOT get the vaccine."
1/1	Three potential vaccines less than a year after the outbreak. Everyone talking about how we can‚Äôt stay locked down forever should‚Äôve just stfu and do what they were told. Much less people would‚Äôve died and we‚Äôre probably gonna be able to end the lockdown in the next 6 months or so
1/-1	Thrilled to had had the vaccination but the second dose of Pfizer hit me hard. I had no reaction to the first dose.
0/0	Thromobocytopenia is on the list as a side affect.
1/-1	Throw the lot in the bin its poison
1/0	Thus far, The Lancet has approved its safety, and that's very encouraging.
1/1	Thus why African are doing well with fewer deaths so far because since birth they're subjected to vaccinations
0	Thx 4 sharing. It helps. I always wondered all that'.
0/0	Tifanny Dover fainted and died from Pfizer vaccine
1/1	Time for me to say "Fuck you" to my antivaxxer friend. Because I had told him, "As long as the vaccine's really effective, then fuck you and anyone else who refuses it. I won't care if you get it."
1/-1	Time to flex on these anti vaxxers by STAYING ALIVE
1/0	Time to get those tranq guns and vaccinate some fools
0/0	Timeliness of the vaccine
1/0	Tin-foilers: "Lockdowns and mandatory masks infringe on muh rights!" Also tin-foilers: "The vaccine will put an end to all this? Try to jab me and see what happens, buddy!"
1/1	To a person like me with a survival chance of around 0%, 89% immunity does sound pretty good.
1	To all of you antivaxxers, smokers, karens, etc. Keep doing the stuff that you are doing, eventually, those practices will get you killed and your stupidness will not pass on along through the generations! NATURAL SELECTION BABY!
1/1	To anyone and everyone involved in the development of the vaccine...... Thank you.
1/1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection.
1/1/1/1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection. The technology is pretty good at replicating how viruses work, and that process itself isn't associated with any long term effects. There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization. I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
0/0	To be honest.....im not going to take the covid vaccine.....
0/0	To be used as a test subject is crazy.No thank you.Ill wait a couple years down the road to see what it does to people.My masks have done just fine.
1/1	To be vaccinated is very good to every body So every body must try to get it
1/1/1/1/1	To be vaccinated is very good. Every one should get
1/1	To date, pregnant health care workers who received the vaccine are doing well.
0/0	To each his own. If you want you can get it. COVID19 has a 99% survival rate. I am not taking the vaccine for 3 simple reasons. 1. It will not prevent me from contracting COVID19 2. It will not prevent me from spreading COVID19 3. I am young, healthy and have no immunity or comorbidities issues
1/1	To everyone who's afraid of microchip tracking through vaccines, wait till you find out about cellphones and social security numbers.
1/1	To everyone who‚Äôs had their jab! Congrats from us at weird water colors.
0/0	To expect a vaccine developed in less than a year to actually be good is nothing short of stupidity and hubris.
1/1	To finally end this pandemic, we need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. It doesn‚Äôt matter which vaccine, get it if it‚Äôs available.
0/0	To hell with VACCINE. Nobody needs such rubbish.
1/1	To help keep your community healthy, get your #CovidVaccine when they tell you it‚Äôs your turn.
0	To many people have died from this vaccines that the media isn't talking about. I'm staying away from it
1/1	To me it doesn‚Äôt matter how one feels, if the people who are the experts in health services and epidemiology say that it is the recommended antidote to the Covid 19 disease and it is the best outcome for the society in which I live if as many as possible agree to have it, I bow to superior knowledge, authority and qualification.
1/1	To me it‚Äôs go as fast as possible but do it safely do it efficiently and make sure it works well but the day comes out and it‚Äôs safe and take a bowl and everything I will be in the lineup for that vaccine for coronavirus
1/1	To not Vaccinate is not an option.
1/1	To outpace the pandemic, everyone needs a vaccine. Until everyone is safe, no one is safe.
1/1	To protect the people who might die from covid as many as possible needs to take the vaccine.
1/1	To recover from the pandemic, we need a truly coordinated and collective commitment to equitable distribution of vaccines.
1/1	To save lives and stop the pandemic, we must protect the truth about vaccines.
0/0	To save you all 13 mins of your life I will tell you how it works, these companies throw some chemicals together, your insurance pays said manufacturer trillions of dollars for you to be a guinea pig. Nah I'm good
0/0	To show statistical significance for a virus of this type, a vaccine must show efficacy, (save lives) period. However, when the overall death rate is between 0.2 and 0.4 %, there will be little to no benefit. In other words, SARS-COV-2 virus is far too weak right now to show a vaccines effectiveness rate numerically, at population scale.
1/1	To the all the wonderful scientists who worked on these vaccines. I thank you for all of your hard work and dedication. And to all the front line workers, lets pray that this nightmare will be over soon.
1/1	To the anti-vaxxers. A couple of allergic reactions isn‚Äôt equatable to the 1 in 1000 deaths we have already had in the UK.
0/0	To the people choosing to get the vaccine, good luck...
0/0	To the people who thought they were getting their lives back if they got the vaccine. You were listening to democrats. DEMOCRATS LIE .
0/0	To those "believers" of these vaccines and have private medical insurances, try to get in touch with them and ask about compensations caused by the side effects. You'll see how deep the rabbit hole is...
1/1	To those without the vaccine? Darwin is laughing at you.
0/0	To vaccinate the world you need lots of brainwashing to someones and lots of threats or intimidations to others. Can not be done without these methods
1/1	Today Got first dose of COVID Vaccine, It is safe.
1/1	Today I also had a vaccine shot...So far everything seems good..

1/1	Todays civilization exists because of vaccines. No strong immune system will help you against COVID-19, Ebola or Malaria.
0/0/0	Todayshow needs to stop glorifying this vaccine, especially being that it is still in a clinical trial period and will be until 2023. Also, It has not been approved by the FDA, and It‚Äôs illegal to force people to take an experimental vaccine. #NoVaccine
1/1	Today‚Äôs sunrise is for my mum who gets her vaccination at 10.20. Putting your life on lockdown hold when you‚Äôre just shy of 80 is tough. And she smashed it. Full of love & pride for her & all this amazing generation.

0/0	Tonight a friend of mine who took the shot was rushed to the hospital via ambulance with numbness in his tongue and lips with pain streaming down his arm. In North Carolina. He took the shot on Friday. It's Tuesday. And his family doesn't think the vaccine has anything to do with these symptoms. He had COVID. Kept the brain fog. Thank you for all you do to educate folks!
1/1	Tons of people that don't believe in the vaccine. Kinda sad to see how many people don't trust science anymore. Hopefully they at least wear a mask till all of us get the vaccine, or they just deal with getting something they don't believe in.
0/1	Tony Blair says it's 'inevitable in the end' regarding using #CommonPass for travel. The same person that said vaccination is the 'route to our liberty.' Not on our watch, Tony. We're just starting.
1/1	Too bad not all of the adults in America want the vaccine... I got my first Pfizer dose last Tuesday and most of my friends are skeptical and would rather wait a while longer before getting a vaccine that was ‚Äúquickly shit out‚Äù.. The disinformation is real in Louisiana...

1/1	Took my in-laws to get vaccinated yesterday. There was a small anti-vaxx protest by one door, w/ a few people carrying signs about how the vaccines contained mini-chips that were going to be used as tracking devices. Man, wait till those people find out about cell phones.
1/1	Took my second dose of the covid vaccine few days ago and I am fine. I am pro vaccine because yes I work in the ER at a hospital and I care about my family. I want to keep my daughter safe and I was not harmed by either vaccines.

0/0/0	Total nonsense!! The vaccin is already mutating... its a normal flu virus!! Its a plan of WEF!!! The world will be hel!
1/1	Total overreacting, clots are common in healthy people, can occur at anytime with no apparent reason.
1/1	Totally Agree. Every nation must have access to the vaccination and the third world countries need to be assisted to get them administered.
1/1	Totally agree. We discussed it on our village site and most people had some sort of reaction for a day or so e.g. shivers, headache, pain in arm. But all were delighted to receive the vaccine.
0/1	Totally bonkers taking it....oh they have also waivered off any rights of prosecution too.
1/1	Totally get a shot.
1/1	Totally going to get it.
1/0/1	Totally safe, zero side effects, 100% effective. Get in line now sheep!
1/1	Totally worth it so that we can reduce the spread and hopefully get closer to normal this year!
1/0	Tough talk for someone who can have their family wiped out by a rusty nail
1/1	Tq for the explanation doc. We need this much as media constantly scares us about death after taking the vaccines.
0	Translation: "People are starting to wake up. We have this narrow window of opportunity to deliver our lethal injections before the masses wake up. We have to do it while the people are still hypnotized. If necessary, we will increase our terrorizing, so the lethal injection will be offered as the solution to escape our terror".
1/1	Treating vaccines like an issue of personal freedom instead of public health is the problem. By all means, inform parents about vaccines. But don‚Äôt give them the impression they have a choice. Vaccines save lives, and the lack of herd immunity is a public health crisis.
0/0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years.
0/-1	Triggering Article 16 was a big mistake and EU heads should roll. BTW there are 4 mutations of C-19 already so the vaccine(s) being "smuggled" will be a placebo for the next pandemic outbreak - they have an efficacy of 50% on the variants already. So within 5 months a new vaccine will be doing the rounds or not! The Dutch trying to sell pork to the Muslims or are you not confusing the Dutch customs officer confiscating the Brits ham sandwiches? - which caused an outrage and made headlines on 1 Jan 21! Recently migrants were rioting in the UK, and set fire to army barracks housing them as a protest of the C-19 outbreak in their camp - or was this just a spot of bother in your opinion?

1/1	True this is for our protection from Covid19 virus. This is safe and very effective. It will help to prevent COVID 19, reduce its number and ultimately eliminate COVID pandemic.
1/-1	Truly real world conditions! My sister is a fully-vaccinated nursing home health care worker. She was vaccinated in the first week. Her three teens, then her husband all came down with Covid about two weeks ago. The kids recovered, the husband is struggling, my sister is absolutely unscathed.

Take supplements that strengthen your immune system, be active and eat right. Your natural immune system is stronger than any vaccine.

0/0	Truth will prevail. It‚Äôs very hard to fully understand what is going on from the information that we receive. There are holes everywhere. We have to stay aware. Question everything and by all means don‚Äôt get in line to receive the vaccine first!!!!
0/0	Truth! When a company cannot be held liable don't take their product. Quit being so naive!

1/0	Ubiquitous viruses are fought and defeated primarily by the T-Cell lymphocytes within our immune systems, Not from antibodies. The entire narrative that is being heavily perpetuated by the science community is False and they must fully understand this. (This is fundamental immunology, first term, first lesson, Chapter -1 "Steps leading through respiratory virus infection, to immunity").
1/1	Uganda has ordered 18 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine at $7/dose. Adding transportation cost, it will cost $17 to fully vaccinate one person with it, the govt said. The vaccine will be used for people above 50, those with underlying conditions and for essential workers.
1/1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
0/0	Ugh! Scary. The Pfizer vaccine seems more lethal.
1/1	Uh you can still get the flu when you get the flu shot so it‚Äôs the same idea. Vaccines don‚Äôt stop you from catching a virus, they prepare your body for when you get the virus so that you have antibodies, or a defense built up to it so that your chances of surviving are much higher. Vaccines also help us achieve herd immunity. Idk why everyone keeps asking this same question, check the other comments for more detailed answers.
0/0	Uhhhh, dude was caught by Project Veritas whistleblower describing his FEAR of the C1984 injection, telling his liberal fascist underlings to reconsider taking it, as ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know the effects of mRNA‚Äù on someone who wants to stay healthy! Why doesn‚Äôt anyone seem to be aware of this. HE WUSSED OUT LONG AGO, PEEPS!

1/-1	Undermining confidence... welcome to Orwellian truth speak üòÑ
0/-1	Understand that many, if not most, of the people in the comments on these videos who endorse the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù aren‚Äôt just ignorant, foolish, and/or uninformed. They get paid to counter rational thinking by the same people who give the MSM their mindless scripts. It‚Äôs tempting, but don‚Äôt waste your time responding to them; it just makes them more money.
1	Understand the stigma surrounding anti-vaxxers and their views on autism. There has been zero reported links between vaccination and autism but there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths linked to a lack of vaccination.
1/0	Unfortunately I'd say about 25% of Americans will refuse the vaccination.
1/1	Unfortunately it dosnt matter what facts you put in front of them or what you say the anti - covid and anti- covid vaccers they will not change their mind until either them or a close loved one is hit with it and become very ill or die, such a pity pride gets in their way. I Will cross my fingers for all of them & hope and pray they or their families never get infected with this sly & very dangerous virus, as luck is what they will need in bucket loads.
1/1	Unfortunately it seems like they've hit a shortage. My state is rescheduling a lot of appointments because we just aren't getting what was promised in.
1/1	Unfortunately many news outlets have been using deaths in individuals who got the vaccine as click bait headlines. I would say you should read the article to see if the CAUSE OF DEATH of due to the COVID vaccine. Most of the time, the articles talk about someone who died and recently got the COVID vaccine, but that doesn't mean the person died FROM the vaccine and it's side effects. For example, someone could get the vaccine and then die in a car crash 2 mins later. It doesn't mean that the vaccine caused their death.
1/0/0	Unfortunately people will read this headline and think that this exonerates AZ. The choice isn't between Covid and AZ, but between AZ and other vaccines. It's not like I'm gonna purposely inject myself with the virus.
1/-1	Unfortunately there is no vaccine for what appears to be 2019's greatest disease: Stupidity.
1/1	Unfortunately we don't have vaccines and may not until 2023, because all of the developing nations literally can't afford the vaccines.
1/1	Unfortunately, some people haven't enough of confident to take covid vaccine while some of theme are willingly to accept it just for the security. In my opinion, i would allowing myself to accept covid vaccine completely just to be secured from sickness!
0/0	Unknown long term side affects are my reason that I refuse to get any new vaccine.

0/0	Until people understand that the same people who sell the cure, make the disease.. will never know how the system works.
0/0	Until the public has concrete proof what is in the vaccine ,i feel no one should take it. I hear that dead fetus matter is put into these vaccines,why?,and why on earth are heavy metals in there?,this raises great concern !. My impression of a vaccine is small dose of the virus . The rise in allergies and Autism has boomed from something,i will follow all laws ,but not a law that is putting harmfull substances into my body .There are natural organic ways to fight viruses.
0	Until these people show me a study of the long-term effects on women that plan to get pregnant, women that are pregnant, women that took it while pregnant, and their babies. I am not taking it, I'm a germ-a-phobe anyways. I will keep taking precautions.

1	Use logic and use the vaccine!
1/1	Use the vaccine and stay safe!
1/-1	Uuuuh, tell that to the people whose kids are being hospitalized for the mumps.
1/1	VACCINATED! I know that the controversy between getting vaccinated or not is big. However, after being someone who was hit by COVID for almost 20 days with serious symptoms despite my athletic conditions and my healthy lifestyle was not an impediment for the virus to hit me hard, fortunately no hospital was necessary and for that reason It is my decision to get vaccinated. I DO NOT want to go through the same thing again or walk in fear as we all are, thinking that if COVID hits me again it could be worse this time. I am also part of this world where all of us are, in my opinion we must cooperate to stop the spread and be able to return to live freely.

1/1	Vaccination = no covid 19 spread
1/1	Vaccination TO THE MOON
1/1	Vaccination against COVID-19 is not a lifestyle or religious convictions choice. It‚Äôs a matter of public health that crosses the normal sanctity of the skin boundary in the interest of the whole population. Ignorance, stupidity, and mis/disinformation is not acceptable as a basis for rejecting, say, licensing for driving or practicing medicine. You cannot be treated as a conscientious objector when your abstinence places the safety of countless others at grave risk. You WILL be vaccinated or else ... That‚Äôs my take and I‚Äôm sticking to it! If we don‚Äôt resolve this matter now we‚Äôll eventually pay more dearly when the next pandemic, perhaps far more lethal, comes along. And it will.
0/1	Vaccination basically means guaranteed casket when #second and #thirdwave arrive.
1/1/1/1/1	Vaccination campaigns and publicity will likely increase that number, i believe. Importantly, politicians and public figures must be out there promoting vaccination as soon as it's available - antivax morons already have a head start

1/1	Vaccinations are giving children a small (EMPHASIS on small) amount of disease chemicals so their bodies can recognize it and fight it off easily.
1/1	Vaccinations are more to protect our loved ones for those of us who are healthy and likely will be asymptomatic carriers.
0/0	Vaccinations in Israel began 49 days ago. Second doses began 28 days ago. People at high risk were prioritized. Nearly the entire elderly population received a second dose more than two weeks ago. So why are serious cases higher now than early January?
1/1	Vaccinations not only protect your child from deadly diseases, such as polio, tetanus, and diphtheria, but they also keep other children safe by eliminating or greatly decreasing dangerous diseases that used to spread from child to child.
0/0	Vaccinations on this scale are unprecedented and could actually promote mutations and thus variants that re-infect you because your immune response is ineffective even if you have had a vaccine or previous infections
1/1	Vaccine + lockdown success

0/0	Vaccine dispensing sites are worth nothing if people don‚Äôt use them, or don‚Äôt trust them, perhaps because of patterns of unfair treatment in interactions with health care providers and government services.
1/1	Vaccine doesn't PREVENT covid, it reduces the severity of infection and hence the number of deaths. Just like BCG at birth doesn't prevent pulmonary TB but reduces the risk of extra pulmonary TB. Stop questioning things YOU DON'T understand !! #COVID19 #GetVaccinated
0/0	Vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop the spread. Even if everyone got the vaccine the virus can still spread. The virus is likely to stop you from getting very sick if you get covid, but not certainly. Basically, we all are gonna get covid and that‚Äôs the only way out of this

0/1	Vaccine hesitancy is disheartening
1/1	Vaccine inequity will prolong the pandemic. We have to vaccinate as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, to save lives and prevent new variants of the virus from gaining ground. The US must share surplus COVID-19 vaccines now!
1/1	Vaccine is Hope. It gives us hope that there could be an end to this pandemic.

0/0	Vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability! ! ! Think About THAT!
1/-1	Vaccine manufacturers are given protection because extremely rare (less than 1:1,000,000) side effects don‚Äôt outweigh the overall good that vaccines do but would bankrupt any pharmaceutical company that made them through civil suits

1/1	Vaccine more than 50 % efficiency is good ho have. Ekle it has 62 % efficiency and no deadly side effects
0/1/0	Vaccine not necessary as less expensive alternatives showing excellent results, such as used on President Trump, are available. Also, I do not as low anything I Inected into my 80 year old, healthy body without personally researching contents. And nobody is talking about huge nu.bers of unreported death from the vaccines. In one Spanish village alone, previous to the vaccine had 10 deaths and when the vaccine was given, 79 people died from it specifically. I trust nothing rolled out this fast with no idea how long it is effective and long term effects.
0/0	Vaccine of death is a no from I.
0/0	Vaccine partners working together to fleece, drug and reduce the world population under the guise of health and safety.
1/1	Vaccine passports are a good idea. Among other things, it will single out the still large contingent of people who refuse vaccines, who will be foreclosed from doing a lot of things their peers can do. That should help break the resistance down.
1/1	Vaccine preliminary results by the summer! This could be phenomenal news.
1/1	Vaccine risk: Divide 6 adverse reactions by 6.8 million vaccines given: <0.00001 Covid risk: Divide 533, 857 confirmed deaths in U.S. by 28.35 million confirmed covid cases (March 30, 2020 to March 30, 2021) 0< 0.02
1/1	Vaccine safer than getting virus.
1/1	Vaccine should be available for all age groups. Vaccine wastage is a reality as many people are not aware enough to take the vaccine. Youth should be allowed too and 50-60 lakh/day vaccine must be administrated.
1/1	Vaccine side effects are minor and quite normal. Definitely, the benefits outweigh the side effects. ‚úî There is no reason not to take the vaccines. üíï

0/0	Vaccines are a CRIME, and we have TO STOP IT, NOW.
0/0	Vaccines are a fucking joke and the virus just isn't going to go away on its own will.
1/1	Vaccines are a gamechanger, but only if they are available to everyone, everywhere. Our chances of coming out of the pandemic depend on how quickly and fairly #CovidVaccines are available to all people, in all countries, starting with the most vulnerable. #Vaccines4All.
1/1	Vaccines are a public health thing, not a government control thing. People urging you to get vaccines are doctors and medical professionals, not politicians.
1/1	Vaccines are a tool, not a panacea. Missing from our approach to managing covid-19 are not just drugs but tests that are accurate, fast, simple to take, cheap, & plentiful. The fed‚Äôl govt needs to make the development/production of such tests a priority.
1/1	Vaccines are about 95% effective and this number shows a much higher effectiveness rate. I think it‚Äôs about 1% that have contracted the virus after being fully vaccinated. This is really good.
1	Vaccines are almost too successful, I remember as a boy listening to my grandma talk about the world she grew up in before vaccines. She was always so grateful that vaccines were invented so that we didn't have to experience that

1/1	Vaccines are cool, but I HATE NEEDLES, but I would get the vaccine
0/0	Vaccines are dangerous and will not prevent you from getting a flu or Covid. . If Vaccinations were safe and effective than why wouldn‚Äôt the manufacturers stand by their product and take full financial responsibility backing their product instead of Govt playing a part of relieving the manufacturers of any financial responsibility.

0/0	Vaccines are in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code
1/1	Vaccines are incredibly safe and have saved millions of lives over the years. Vaccines are one of the best scientific advances of our time. Taking a vaccine is like giving our cells a college course for finding and dismembering viruses. It‚Äôs truly genius.
1/1	Vaccines are just updates to your body.
0/0	Vaccines are like a poison funded by the government
1/1	Vaccines are like a training course for the immune system. They prepare the body to fight disease without exposing it to disease symptoms. When foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses enter the body, immune cells called lymphocytes respond by producing antibodies, which are protein molecules. These antibodies fight the invader known as an antigen and protect against further infection.
1/1	Vaccines are like bullet-resistant vest. It is not really bullet proof, but if I am a soldier I'd prefer wearing one.
1/1	Vaccines are meant to attack the host, so your body's immune system learns to defend itself against the actual virus. This is why antivaxxers are a thing because they believe that big pharm and governments are trying to kill them, but fact is they're too uneducated
1/0	Vaccines are not a 100% guarantee that you won‚Äôt get COVID. They greatly reduce your chance of getting COVID, or of spreading COVID. And if a vaccinated person gets COVID they probably won‚Äôt become severely sick or die. They also may be less effective against the new variants.
0/1	Vaccines are not coming to hurt you; grow a brain.
0/0	Vaccines are not mandatory. Encourage immune system defense with sunshine, fresh air (no mask), exercise, fresh fruits & veggies, supplemented Vitamin C/D/Zinc and proper rest.
0/0	Vaccines are not much useful or effective on God "s pandemic (Covid 19).
0	Vaccines are not safe.
0/0	Vaccines are not the way out of lockdown but a Zero Covid Strategy...
0/0	Vaccines are obviously dangerous. Every person who got vaccinated - died. Governments have to bury secretly half a billion people. Don't trust the government. Check your sources. I got all my information from facebook groups and whatsapp messages. I trust it way more than government and doctors. Be smart like me. I didn't finish high school, but I know more than all doctors and scientists in the world who say that we should get vaccinated.

1/1	Vaccines are the most important public health measure and most effective strategy to protect population.

1/1	Vaccines being authorized for children cannot come soon enough.
1/1	Vaccines can also protect people who can't receive them
1/1	Vaccines can be controversial for many reasons, and this video talking about how they actually work brings up an idea that is not talked about as often. Because of how vaccines work, people sometimes view them as counterintuitive. Because vaccines work by injecting a person with a small amount of the disease, or diseases, they are being protected against, people question how it works. When people are injected with the vaccine, it is common to experience side effects such as coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever. These symptoms, which are most commonly associated with becoming sick, sometimes make people feel like the vaccine is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. They go in trying to protect their kid from getting sick, so they often wonder why their kid starts to show signs of developing a cold or flu. These symptoms can easily be explained by what they are doing. They are working to trap things like bacteria and get rid of them from the body. After that, adaptive immunity kicks in and programs the body to get rid of these types of bacteria if they are introduced to the body in the future. Though the process and symptoms may seem harmful to parents, they are actually helping the child. When children are vaccinated against diseases, they have the opportunity to live a healthier life.

1/1	Vaccines do cause severe side-effects, the thing is, THAT IS VERY VERY RARE, so it is worth taking the risk. Imagine you have to undergo a medical procedure to remove a tumor from your body, YES THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED, but people usually take the risk! The thing with vaccines is, the risk is extremely low.
0/0/0/0	Vaccines do have side effects though. Moreover imunity against virus doesn't last more than 2 years
1/1	Vaccines do not even cause autism, though. The first time experience of getting them is disrupts routine and is an unpleasant sensory experience which makes previously-unnoticed autism obvious, but they do not trigger a massive rewiring of the brain, antivaxxers.

1/1	Vaccines don't harm, ignorance does.
1/1	Vaccines don't save people, vaccinations do. Let's all do our part to educate others!
1/1/1	Vaccines don't save people, vaccinations do. Let's all do our part to educate others! Here's a great video explaining mRNA vaccine technology. It is patently untrue when someone claims that the vaccine can infect you. People get jittery when they hear mRNA, but bear in mind, mRNA is just a derivative of DNA. Every living thing fundamentally relies on mRNA to exist. If the idea of receiving a novel vaccine makes you nervous, I reccomended you don't look up how little we know about COVID-19 infection long-term. We do know that other viral infections can cause lymphomas, sterility, cardiotoxicity, and many other problems long-term.
1/1	Vaccines don't take years to study Vaccines take years, normally, because they are incredibly time consuming to make and even more difficult to reach an acceptable efficacy. When you add in the stringent red tape of the FDA, this process takes a long time. These processes were given a freeway to approval for Covid. And with BILLIONS dumped into research and development by the government for these vaccines, it's perfectly reasonable why they were produced as quickly as they were. Pharma companies don't dump billions into vaccine research. Which is another reason why it normally takes years to make. There is a massive misconception of "not enough time to study, we don't know the long term effects". This statement is proof in itself that you literally don't know what you are talking about. For one, take the mRNA Moderna vaccine. The mRNA is the only active ingredient. Do you know what else makes up the rest of it? Salt, sugar, and lipids. All of which have been in your body thousands of times. The mRNA was proven completely safe as your body naturally breaks it down almost immediately. The number one severe side effect of vaccines is allergic reaction. This happens usually within 15-30 minutes. Most other side affects appear within a few days. After two weeks the chances of side effects are essentially zero. There is no "long term" side effects. That's an anti vaxxers stance and it's completely made up. In summary, vaccines take years to make not because they are worried about the long term side effects. But simply because of money, manpower, and red tape. All of which got a massive boost for Covid.

1/1	Vaccines work. The problem is, about 40% of America are anti-vaxxer Q-idiots and probably won't get vaccinated. This is also why America brought back polio, whooping cough and measles. Thank the fanatical, idiot anti-vaxxer mommies.

1/1	We got the Oxford vaccine. It works. It really works.
1/1	We got the flu shot and will get the Covid vaccine when available.
1/1	We got to stick to the rules so we can be with our family at Christmas
1/1	We had the Vaccine as soon as we could. The advantage of being old!!
0/0	We hate the covid vaccine
0/-1	We have a birth right to freedom to roam, speech, thought, decision making and choice and much much more and we DON'T need their corporate fake structures and rules and FAKE legalese to tie us up
0/0	We have a friend that had a stroke right after injection!
1/1	We have a vacation booked for eight weeks after the second shot. We'll still mask up, but I feel we'll be alright by then.
0/0	We have been told that drug trials take 10 years (to insure their safety). Yet now, in a matter of months an Arsenal of vaccines are being released for use. Even the simplest of minds can see that something doesn‚Äôt add up... No option here other than raising red flags & suspicions...!
0/0	We have never made a vaccine for any human strains of SARS successfully.
1/1	We have one of the very best and most effective vaccination programmes of any advanced nation. That seems to grate on some people for some bizarre reason.
1/1	We have our appointments for Thursday, looking forward to it!!
0/0	We have our own dna to protect
1/-1	We have the right to choose whether or not to vaccinate, and vaccination is not a carnival like the current Olympics.
1/1	We hope this is the beggining of the end
1/1	We hope to see children get vaccinated.
1	We just need a global government to make everyone vaccinate
1/1	We just need more vaccinators. More local sites
0/0	We just spent 12 months hibernating to avoid getting Covid now you are going to line us all up and inject us with it , if the amount of time and money was spent to find a cure a way to kill the virus injecting everyone with a small dose of Covid in the whim and hope that people develop an immunity to it is just RIDICULOUS there are ways to kill the virus and I have been Silenced too long Wake up to yourself before you inject everyone and end up with 5 million DEAD and 10 million infected and the other 10 million only protected for 2 months when the Virus Evolves Again!!!. Seek and destroy is the only way to go where would we all be today if this was our goal ???? I'll tell iu where we would be WORLD Leaders find the CURE fuck the Vaccine off you are asking for trouble with it .
1/1	We just want to live our lives without worrying of getting infected
0/0	We keep reading stories and hearing news about people dying two days after taking the vaccine. That does not make Me feel to comfortable especially seeing one drug company gave up on the idea and actually said that human immunology is the best way as has been taking place for thousands of years. I would like to donate my dose to anyone who wants it.
1/1	We knew all along the vaccine was safe. People fall ill all the time, that‚Äôs normal, but you you can‚Äôt blame it on Easter eggs, aspirin, toothpaste etc.
0/0	We know NOTHING about long-term side effects!
1/1	We like the shot! üíâüíâ
1/1	We live in a time where even going to the hospital is risky. And people still dont want to take the vaccine ?
1/1	We live in a town called Arandas Jalisco Mexico, and we are dying from covid_19 every day there are new patients ,,, authorities, please deploy the vaccine in Mexico .. God bless you.
1/1	We live in a world where people trust random people on the internet rather than specialists. Its stupid. Im taking my shots, gl iditots.
1/0	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments
0/0/0/0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments.
0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments. No vaccine for me
1/1	We love You Potus FANTASTIC shot in the arm, and so convenient not far to go, we must be the pinnacle example of a nation for vaccines, POTUS shire greatness with your speech today was brilliant, amazing. Our nation is blessed
1/1/0	We mandate education standards for the well-being of children, and mandate standards for what counts as illegal abuse or neglect. By the same reasoning, i think we can mandate vaccines.
1/1	We may get our lives back sooner!
1/1	We must continue to spread awareness of the benefits of getting vaccinated as well as make the vaccine more accessible to black and brown communities. #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #JohnsonandJohnson
1/1	We must do everything possible to reduce the circulation of #COVID19 and delay mutations that may reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines.
1/0	We must first accelerate vaccination dramatically, curb superspreaders, enforce masks etc. We should have been doing this for months. Lockdowns come when these measures fail.
1/1/1/1	We must help our government or support them to bring the best vaccine so we can get rid of all this
0/0	We must not get the jab no matter what! Hang in there friends!
1/-1	We must recognize that in spite of these reports of potential negative side effects, evidence shows the benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine still strongly outweigh the risks.
1/1	We must stop this Virus as soon is possible ! For Better and stronger America ! Wear a mask social distance and get a vaccine !
1/1	We need 65 to 70% of us to get the vaccine otherwise it could go on forever just like polio or diphtheria would have. Stop being so paranoid people. You are the problem if you dont get the shot. Stop being babies and stop the stupidity.
1/1	We need AstraZeneca+Oxford university vaccine!!
0/0	We need a "vaccination" /protection against Corporate Fraud, Treason and Lies, not against the scamdemic virus.
1/1	We need a coronavirus vaccine
1/-1	We need a vaccine against anti vaccine claims going viral. Oh wait...
1/1	We need a vaccine that can protect people from stupidity. Now. I would buy that for a dollar.
1/1	We need a vaccine to protect the elderly.
1/1	We need a vaccine.
1/1	We need all the vaccines they can make to slow down and stop people from getting sick or dying .
1/0	We need as many ppl as we can get vaccinated because viruses evolve and if more ppl go out with incomplete vaccinations and interact with ppl from different areas carrying different strains. This problem will last longer than it should. Unnecessary deaths will continue beyond the Trump foolishness
0/0	We need germs and bacteria, we are only hurting ourselves with all these antibacterial cleaners, the healthiest people live on farm's
1/1	We need lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines in every community across the country. That means we need comprehensive aid to all states, cities and counties to administer the vaccine quickly and efficiently.
0/0	We need money to survive not your vaccines
1/1	We need rescue. The world needs to be rescued from the hardships of this virus.
0/0/0	We need the Republican politicians to vaccinate the Democrat politicians and the Democrat politicians to vaccinate the Republican politicians, on camera, with an independant public forum verifying that they use real vaccines to see how well they trust these vaccines.
1/1	We need the vaccine already to end this madness.
1/1	We need the vaccine in Antigua. I am ready for it.
1/1	We need the vaccine to save people and lives.
1/1	We need this vaccine!!!
1	We need to achieve the coverage needed to realise herd immunity in every community.
0/0	We need to ban all vaccines. Period! Not one vaccine has been through the Gold Star Standard of testing and not one vaccine has done a double blind test. The MMR Vaccine has created over 77 million autistic kids globally, 80% black boys. The WHO just admitted to the MMR and Autism connection
1/1	We need to eliminate this virus. Therefore PLEASE!!! Take it!
1/1	We need to fund vaccines for all!
1/1	We need to get our high school athletes vaccinated. It's the younger crowd that's falling ill now.
1/1	We need to get the vaccine if we want to save our lives‚Ä¶
1/1	We need to keep Responsible for Social Dectencing and Fallow Covid Guidelines I think it won't be over from another 6 months that's my Personal opinion about it that is all to say
1/1	We need to protect eachother, the best way to do it is by taking the vaccine!
1/1	We need to stay united and care for eachother by taking the vaccine.
1/1	We need to take the vaccine! The children can‚Äôt go to school if not vacinatted
0/0	We need to trust GOD not some suspect injection
1/1/1/1	We need vaccinations against stupidity.
1/1/1	We never treated this virus seriously. It's not flu. It's not cold. You want to live with the virus? Then get yearly jabs of covid vaccine every winter as well as flu jabs.
1/1	We now have FIVE, yes FIVE, generations of our family vaccinated! It was a lot of work and persistence scheduling them all but we got it done.
1/-1	We now have a permanent, substantially dumb, underclass of people. 40 years of underfunding public education starting with Reagan and this is where we are.
1/1/1/1/1	We really need the vaccine as soon as possible it is so slow
1/1	We received our Pfizer vaccine yesterday. A heartfelt gratitude to everyone who works at Pfizer and BioNtech - you are literally saving the world. I know so many of you worked so hard and continue to work tirelessly. My gratitude is immeasurable. Thank you!
1/1	We should also be grateful for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine which jump-started the vaccination programme.
0/0	We should be worried as the vaccine was rushed
1/1	We should grateful to all scientist
0/0	We should never let the possibility of death get in the way of receiving an experimental vaccine.
1/1	We should not just keep waiting for several more years while this pandemic wreaks havoc on us we need vaccine .
1/1	We should open source our vaccines, that would help a lot.
0/0	We should start with Journalists that say it is safe.
0/0	We simply don't know about long term effects. There hasn't been enough time
1/1	We stand on the shoulders of giants. Research from previous MERS and SARS have given us research for almost 10 years
0/0	We still don't know what the long term effects are. It may be safe for a couple days but most meds are. I can take penicillin for a few days but after that no. Statin drugs are tolerated for a few days but after that the effects are horrible. You don't know the full effects until later.
0/0	We still have no long term studies of the vaccine, how can this be approved without that information?
1/1	We sure love complaining about everything in the UK, but we have done so well with this vaccine rollout. I'm rather proud.
1/1	We take Vaccines and medicines so we dont die at 50 like they did 200 years ago. Its not rocket science
1/-1	We thank you for the support and encouragement
0/0	We the people dont want to be turned into a gmo organism
0/0	We want and need secure vaccines, proved sufficiently before inoculating the people...I prefer to die for COVID, that for a NON SECURE VACCINE!!!!!
0/0	We want medicine, remedy and cure for this . Not vaccines. We are not laboratory rats !!!
1/1	We were ill after ours but will still definitely be having the second dose, we need to do everything we can to get this COVID under control.
0/0	We were warned years ago, more pandemics coming, we were given cure, do not trust vaccines!
1/1	We will beat the pandemic!
0/0	We will definitely say no to the vaccine.
0/0/0	We will die one day for sure. Hell no to this poison
0/0	We will not get vaccinated and sign our own death warrants.
1/1	We will only get this global corona pandemic under control if we enable vaccination for all people worldwide. Health must not be made dependent on whether a person is the supply or a drug can afford financially
1/1	We will see this in US, once we have more than 50% of population vaccinated.
1/1	We will wave Corona goodbye with these vaccines!
0/0	We witnessed how Johnson & Johnson treated people who got cancer from using their powder. NO THANKS üò°
0/0/0	We won't know what the long term effects are for at least a year or longer from this being widely distributed. It's perfectly sensible to not rush to take a newly developed vaccine - and to reserve it for those who have a priority need for it.
0/0	We won‚Äôt be having a covid vaccine... maybe in 10 years time when we know the long term effects of it!
0/-1	We won‚Äôt know who‚Äôs died with the vaccine but we will know who‚Äôs died without the vaccine.
0/0	We won‚Äôt take the vaccine because it won‚Äôt have had adequate testing and is already causing some people some pretty horrific ailments.
1/1	We'll explained! I hope that enough people have faith in our scientific institutions to take the vaccine so we can fight back the virus. The worst case here is that not enough people take it to develop community immunity. This video certainly helps, but for each credible video like this there are 100 videos propagating fear because it's easier to make a video where you make up the content yourself.
1/1	We'll get our lives back this year, I assure you, this nightmare will end soon!
1/1	We'll see. as I'm at the high risk persons list, I got the 1st dose last month and will have the 2nd dose in 2 weeks. I'll let you know.
1/1	We're all in this together, folks. Every person on the planet is equally affected. This virus does not discriminate. Please, fellow people around the world, get vaccinated as soon as you have a chance.
1/1	We're getting our second dose in early April. All signs point to extremely reduced chances of transmission once vaccinated. We will continue to wear masks where required in public, but we will start actually doing things again and seeing our families.
0/0	We're human beings and as such we have ancient human rights; the council of Europe decrees that vaccines must NOT be mandatory and the non-vaccinated NOT discriminated against. I'm sick to death of being rode roughshod over
1/1	We're in a life threatening pandemic. We have no defense. So, for most people, they should absolutely get it.
0/0	We're not being told how many people are dying or being injured by these experimental gene therapies. I just read that this week a guy got his 2nd dose of one of the vaccines and went blind two days later.
0/0	We're seeing serious "allergic reactions" to these vaccines already that require hospitalization. The establishment also tells us these RNA vaccines can't rewrite our DNA...but now apparently they can through reverse transcriptases
0/0	We're told the science is settled. We're told vaccines are "safe and effective". We're told that vaccines do not cause autism. We're told to believe otherwise is to be a conspiracy theorist. Here is what we're NOT told about vaccines and autism:
0/-1/0	We've been fucked by pharmaceutical companies time and time again falsifying their results and rushing testing. Profit based development of medical sciences has destroyed the public's trust in it, capitalism has only itself to blame.
1/1	We've got a new way to distiguish between people that payed attention in school or not, anti-vaxxers or not... Please just take the shot people...
1/1/1/1	We've had to take vaccines from childhood for polio, diphtheria, etc to adulthood for many types of influenza. So why not now? Looks like we have no other choice. I was very scared about taking the vaccine because I am a senior and the most allergic person in the world but I didn't have a problem. I'm still around.
0/0	We've only just started vaccinating and people are dying already from the jabs , what the heck is going on , why isn't the MSM reporting this
1/1	We've passed 700,000 total vaccine doses administered in WA. These vaccines are an incredible scientific achievement, but we must get them into arms. That's why we're rapidly expanding our distribution program.We only have a small amount of vaccine, but we'll use every dose.
1/1	We've seen the best and the worst of what humanity has to offer this year. The developers of these vaccines deserve recognition.
0/0	Weakened viruses in vaccines do make people sick, if they have weak immunity.
1/1	Wear a mask, get the vaccine. What's so hard to understand?
1/1	Wear a mask, social distance, stay home, wash your hands and get the covid 19 vaccination. Let's defeat this disease.
1/1	Wear a mask, stay alive, get vaccine. It's pretty simple, but some people just can't be smart.
1/1	Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed.
0/0/0	Weigh the risks & rewards of treating C19 as ‚Äú1% fatality rate‚Äù disease vs risks and rewards (or lack thereof) of the vaccine. Also attach the manmade unproven tax on the vaccine where people don‚Äôt want to feel like lab rats + underreporting of vaccine deaths.
0/0	Weird how nobody's making videos for innocent children about how AWESOME their IMMUNE SYSTEM are... and how to make them even STRONGER !!!!
1/1	Weird, I took my first covid shot of Moderna two weeks ago. I had mild side effects, Fatigue, chills and head aches, one day after the vaccine and felt invincible after that. But I have been feeling like crap before taking the vaccine since April , mostly dizziness, fatigue, and asthma. Maybe I had covid at some point and never noticed. I never had a fever.
1/1	Welcome to 2021, where people believe there‚Äôs a microchip in vaccine
0/0	Welcome to all your new auto -immune disorders
0/0	Welcome to all your new auto -immune disorders!
1	Welcome to the USA, where logic and facts are debatable.
1/-1	Well I am in the target group of Covid19 so I will leave a vapour trail, possibly a ‚ÄúSonic Boom‚Äù may be evident all the may to the vaccination point.
1/-1	Well I am sure many will be running to get theirs after seeing this
1/1	Well I and millions of others have been happy to take that risk. The AZ vaccine is based upon a more conventional approach to developing a vaccine, using repurposed' research data (based upon a Chimpanzee Adenovirus) which started several years ago, in developing a vaccine to combat Ebola. So the AZ vaccine has not been derived from any novel approach from a standing start. So I have a lot of confidence in AZ and how they have developed this vaccine. Its a very similar approach to how many other vaccines are developed and which we all have when we go on holiday to different parts of the world without any concerns. All medication carries a risk, even simple paracetomol, because all of us react to medication in different ways. But to be honest having a Covid vaccination is the only way out of this crisis whatever you think and the more people who have the vaccinations, the less opportunity the virus will have to mutate in to something much much worse. So I would encourage everyone to have the vaccination. The risk of getting Covid and being hospitalised and possibly dying, far outweigh the risk that the vaccines may trigger a negative reaction to it by our bodies.
1	Well I can report that I‚Äôve had the AstraZeneca vaccine this morning and it was painless and very well organised. No sign of any side effects yet (after 4 hours) nor have I turned into a WiFi hotspot. Rolling on the floor laughing #getthejab
1/1	Well I don't want to jinx it but it's been 12 hours since I had my second covid vaccine and I feel fine? This time after the first one I was bundled up in bed shivering.
1/1	Well I feel alittle better about getting it now.
1/1	Well I got the first dose of Pfizer and go back for second dose on the 28th. I had no side effects, just a little soreness where the injection went
1/1	Well I guess we‚Äôll just enjoy covid forever then...our country is full of anti-vaxxers and you‚Äôre not helping! I have a very small chance of being killed by a bus running me down every time I step outside, still go outside though, cause the benefits outweigh the risks...
1/1	Well I had the J&J shot and had symptoms from it at night and felt sick the next day but then after a week i was fine
1/1	Well I just caught Covid last week so I guess I have no choice but to wait for the vaccine now
1/1	Well I just got my 2nd COVID vaccine shot so so far so good. Hope you get this whole thing straightened out man.
1/1	Well I just lost another friend to the virus and she was only 48. I can't afford to get the virus as I am older with health issues. Getting the vaccine for me is the best choice. The virus could kill me. I don't care what the issues may be years down the road . I will be old then..
1/1	Well I wasn‚Äôt going to tweet about it because it‚Äôs nothing millions of people haven‚Äôt done ... but I am too excited - I got my first vaccine shot today!!!!
0/0/0	Well I wont b takin vaccine coz i dont trust it
1/1	Well I'm getting my vax, and I was basically a hermit before Covid so I really couldn't care less if the world goes back to normal. Whether we reach herd immunity and go back to normal is entirely up to them. It's not gonna happen until enough ppl get vaxxed though. They don't seem to understand that.
1/1	Well I'm getting vaccinated and you will too if you want participate in society
0/0	Well I‚Äôm not going to trust you to inject me.
1/1	Well I‚Äôm ridiculously excited to be told I can have my first injection tomorrow evening. Wild horses wouldn‚Äôt stop me!!!
1/1	Well I‚Äôve had a lot of abuse on Twitter talking about vaccines but I am going to continue. You‚Äôre more likely to develop a blood clot from the oral contraceptive pill. The risk of you dying of COVID far outweighs that of getting a clot. RT if you‚Äôre having the vaccine.
1/1	Well at least our parents and grandparents were brave enough to take vaccines elimnating small pox and polio. We cannot even wear a mask so sad.
0/0	Well count me out. Thanks my guy lol.
1/1	Well despite the snow and wonderful driving conditions, I managed to get my Covid vaccine this morning!
1/1	Well done Novavax! Now let‚Äôs get this rolling out and help kick this pandemic squarely in its genomic nuts!
1/1	Well done all Countries. This is really hard for us all. Remember, none of us have total freedom until the majority of the World is vaccinated. Let's all help each other best we can?
1	Well done educational video to understand the purpose of vaccination so folks get anyone they're offered...............it needs to have more than 6 million views
1/1	Well done our government for getting a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt cost the earth too. Astra Zeneca are not making huge sums of money out of it, unlike other companies.
1/1	Well done to all the scientists for all their hard work. Onward and upwards into 2021
1/1	Well done to our fantastic scientists and all those involved, we need to move faster on executing this now
1/1	Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
1/1	Well done!! I hope I get the chance to take this vaccine soon
1/-1	Well done, definitely the right thing to do
1/1	Well either way I'm getting my first shot in two weeks so wish me luck.
0/0	Well for me personally I've never had a flu vaccine and I've never gotten the flu coincidence I think not
1/1/1	Well i didnt get any problems and have 0 side effects mind boggling huh
1/1	Well i have a 11 month daughter my wife took i don't ever get sick but im taking it for her safety
1/1	Well if people r too stupid to vacinate , feel sorry for them and their families.
1/-1	Well if you would rather take your chance with Covid than the vaccine that's up to you . I suppose its a case of weighing up the longterm unknown risks associated with taking the vaccine against the know risks of dying from Covid based on your age. I would rather have the vaccine as I have less chance of dying .
1/1	Well im not leaving my house till i get my vaccine. I was actually lookin forward to the vaccine so i didnt die from just being near someone. Looks like im going to be stuck in for another year -_-
0/0	Well it is not FDA approved. It is still experimental. You have seen people getting severe side effects from it.
1/1	Well it would be nice to think that, specially when I am unable to make myself comfortable due to covid 19 illness - been ill for 8 days and this really blows
0/-1	Well mainstream media ain't to be trusted that's for starters
0/0	Well my mom started losing her hair so it must be a good thing right?
0/0	Well ok if u want you take it, risk becoming an SCP
1/-1	Well presented - thank you!
1/0	Well respected journal the lancet published phase 1 and phase 2 trial results and say it produces sufficient antibodies in all patients. Phase 3 trials with 40 thousand people have begun.
1/1	Well said and agree that on above all and priority basis the health workers and older people should get vaccination. Definitely, there is logic and prioritization is fundamental to get control over and overcome the obstacles of covid 19.
1/1/1/1	Well said! I‚Äôm a school nurse and got the COVID 19 vaccine 11 days ago with no reservations. I‚Äôm working hard to keep my students and staff safe.
1/1	Well said. "Lifesaving vaccines shouldn't be auctioned off to the highest bidder. In a global pandemic like COVID, corporations must put people over profits." Universal Covid-19 vaccines for all.
0/0	Well thank the heavenly FATHER who created us all to think of making us an immunity system to where u dont need a vaccine which is the virus and these demons are getting paid to infect u all even in the
1	Well that's good but who knows how long it will be until it's rolled out to the public
1/1	Well that's really encouraging and enlightening. I may take vaccine.
0/-1	Well the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent people from getting covid or spreading it. plus if you care to notice ... the more people get vaccinated with these experimental vaccines. the higher the variant cases get ! Welcome to year #2 of 2 weeks to flatten the curve. all for a virus they are telling you will be like any other annoying childhood illness
0/0	Well they can shove it up that dark place as far as I am concerned, when asked about the over 65s as to the effectiveness of their so called wonder vaccine they answered in a typical vagueness well suited to a cheap skate politician... They did not have data on it in regards to the over 65s was their answer, in other words the jury was out on it but its safe to take it... a bit of a contradiction would be an understatement.
0/0	Well they just about got all the older people vaccinated so now they're saying its attacking kids so they can push to get them vaccinated..something isnt right with these vaccines..
1/1	Well this is convenient timing to have this recommended, I'm actually sitting in the waiting area after getting my first dose!
0/0	Well this vaccine will only help the body to tolerate the 5 g frequencyz more better...
0/0	Well yeah because it‚Äôs gene therapy and NOT a vaccine at all.
1/-1	Well, "socialist" government research funding laid the groundwork for the vaccine, before it was worth creating a startup to develop a product. And arguably, the distribution is failing because of a lack of "socialist"-style government planning, not because of red tape.
1/1	Well, I actually don't want to get this virus. It's pretty bad, and neither do I want to pass it on to anyone (even you). So I'll be getting a jab. Don't be so selfish.
0/0	Well, I can't be the only person scared shitless by these scientists giving it their best "reckon".
1/0	Well, I will take the vaccine if the pharmaceutical companies can be sued for disability or death caused by said vaccine
1/1	Well, I'm 67 years old and have multiple preexisting health conditions and I've been trying to get an appointment for the vaccine for three weeks and can't get an appointment through those sites and myturn.com
1/1	Well, I'm 67 years old and have multiple preexisting health conditions and I've been trying to get an appointment for the vaccine for three weeks and can't get an appointment through those sites and myturn.com and I haven't gotten anywhere. I've tried the phone number to although I don't have to because I am tech savvy. It's not us, it's L.A. County that doesn't have their shit together.
1/1	Well, I‚Äôm feeling absolutely fabulous today, more than 24hours after getting my initial #COVID19Vaccine dose. Make sure you have yours when it‚Äôs your turn, especially high risk communities
1/1	Well, at least more vaccines for us intelligent people!
0/0	Well, do what you want. Personally, me, never would I trust these people.
0/0	Well, for me these were not mild side effects, fever and chills and swearing? No, thanks, I won‚Äôt have it! Probably I had it already last February!
1/1/1	Well, have fun taking your chances everyone, I'm getting it. Really not a hard decision. You seem to be afraid of what you don't understand, but to me this really isn't scary at all. This is technology, and I'm taking advantage of it.
0/0	Well, here we are at that point in time where we have to fight for the right to NOT be injected with poison.
1/1	Well, if you don't get vaccinated.. Be prepared for that virus to target you. When we are all unavailable to it, it will seek a new host... Aka none vaxers.
0/0	Well, it is your choice but don‚Äôt tell me to do it!
1/1	Well, maybe this would make some people be mentally able to drink Corona beer again.
1/1/1	Well, thank you, good to know cause this is the vaccine that many of us will be probably receiving here in Spain. It's a relief. Let's just hope the South African variant won't become dominant and other more virulent variants won't appear
1/1	Well, this vaccine is being made with world class technology, with the cooperation of many first world countries all sharing information and making a vaccine. If they release it to the public, it‚Äôs safe.
0/0	Well, vaccine was 100% effective in killing a doctor from Brazil last year. Look at the history of vaccine. The 1st polio vaccine that went out to the kids in quartine died from the 1st batch of vaccines. The news is so biased not a single episode has been based. I want ingredients for vaccine and pros and cons.
1/1	Well.. at least most of the anti-vaxxers will die from their own choices.
1/1	Well...every vaccination make a few reactions,so its better have in my body any defens to fight againts virus...
0/0	Welp - still not getting vaccinated
1/1	Welp the people who don‚Äôt want it will get covid and die sucks for them for being absolutely insane I just feel bad for them at this point
0/0	Went to lunch with a small group of relatives (8) when the subject of Covid vaccination came up and only one among us has gotten the vaccine. The other seven of us agreed we were not getting it under any circumstances.
1/1	Western world; got the institutions with some of the smartest people on the planet with some of the most advance tech. Also western world; vaccine caused autism.
0/0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re better off watching the Simpson√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, as their predictions are spot on !
0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
1/1	We‚Äôll be busy building antibodies! Be part of the solution and get your vaccine too!
1/1/1	We‚Äôre definitely picking up speed now.
1/1	We‚Äôre just building resistance, it‚Äôs all good!
1/1	We‚Äôre just thankful that we in our 90s and 60s got our 2 shots of Moderna last February and we‚Äôre alive and well and look forward to gathering with our fully vaccinated family and friends in the next few months without masks
0/1	We‚Äôre only as safe as our communities with the lowest vaccination rates.
0/0	We‚Äôre seeing fully vaccinated individuals getting Covid, plus you still have to wear a mask. So, what‚Äôs the point a false sense of protection.
1/-1	We‚Äôve all heard you can‚Äôt get the flu from the flu shot, but why does it sometimes give you ‚Äúflu like symptoms?‚Äù The answer is in your immune response!
1/1	We‚Äôve become a nation of whiners and babies. Side effects, really? How about thank you to researchers who have worked tirelessly on this?
0/0	We‚Äôve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
0/1	What !!!!! But they've bypassed the very one that they cannot /should not bypass (but HAVE) according to the Nuremberg Code. I just cannot believe this video. These people are actually publicly, happily, blatantly ignoring the Nuremberg Code. Previous trials for other covidviruses....all the animals died after a time.
0/0	What I do know is that I will not take it. Ivermectin is the answer not this Vac.
0/0	What I don't understand is how the vaccine immunity supposedly lasts buy natural immunity does not. ..that doesn't make sense to me
1/1	What I find pretty odd is that people seem to worry a lot about possible long-term effects of a vaccine while worrying little about those of COVID-19.
1/1	What I learn. Anti vaxxers are more deadlier than virus.
1	What I liked about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is the no tears after I shampoo my hair.,
0/0	What T F are you talking how can you guarantee it won't go to nucleaus.. only in ribosome.. how can you vouch for such theory.. it's just a theory.. .. you guys have no idea what can or cannot happen when you jab with mRNA vaccines... it's all being rushed.. and you guys will kill lot of people soon, Molecular cell biology is not that great.. nobody is so sure... there are zillions of things in it.. you cannot understand .. it's not like newton's laws.. this is damn complex... do not come and preach half ass science here..
0/-1	What a LIAR
0/0	What a bozo... The executives of moderna are nonchalant about perpetrating the largest case of fraud the world has ever known.
0/0	What a crock! All this for an illness with an untreated survival rate of 99.9%, more so if treated early.
0/0	What a disgusting piece of propaganda trying to use peer pressure to push an untested medical experiment!
1/1/1	What a fantastic job all of the people who have had a part in creating this vaccine. Thank you for your efforts.
0/-1	What a glorious testament to human ingenuity!
0/0	What a joke, J&J vaccines is paused and yet AZ vaccines merely changed the name and packaging intending to sell more, both vaccines have the same blood clotting issues! The intentions behind it is sadly obvious!
0/0	What a load of crap this all is, especially this channel itself, I don't trust vaccines
0/0	What a load of propaganda - "she's playing her part". That just demonises those who don't as 'not playing their' part' in keeping society safe. What game is the UN playing here. Let's not forget that it was the UN's cover up for China that contributed to the virus teaching pandemic proportions. The V sign I'm holding up is the British one, which means... This vaccine is too rushed. The UN can't say what is going to happen in the long run. More studies need to be done, but for the sake of business and profit, they are going ahead.
1/1	What a relief. My mother received her first dose on Saturday. She is 70, with COPD, and she has hunkered down for this entire pandemic. To think that, once the vaccine does its job, she can survive this virus as if it were a cold? Well, it is simply a huge relief.
1/1	What a trooper. A flu shot is really essential this year with the Covid pandemic. I will definitely be getting the Covid vaccine when that is available. Thank you for sharing
1/1	What a wonderful sentiment and recommendation from one of the world‚Äôs experts who really knows and appreciates the miracle that these vaccines represent. I can only imagine how good the compliance would be if vaccinations were available for the Spanish Flu a century ago; a lot like the polio vaccine in the 1950s.
1/1	What a wonderful thing to do. Made me cry. 90 years young and wanting the vaccine . Awesome.
0/0	What about Billy gates nano chips injection king
0/-1	What about Tiffany Doven? Is she alive since she took it? Anybody knows if she is ok?
0/0	What about all the people around the world a lot in the US dieing shortly after having the vaccine, sweeping that under the rug are we?
0/-1	What about all the people dying from vaccine Doc? All of you will be held liable.
0/0	What about all the people that are having major reactions, with some dieing from these vaccines?
0/-1	What about all the scientist that were banned off YouTube for having the wrong "scientific" opinion on the "pandemic". Is YouTube a great arbiter of scientific fact?
0/0	What about animal studies where the animals with Mrna vaccine got a cytokine storm. And the animals got very sick or die.
0/0	What about people who already have autoimmune disorders? Does that increase the risk of the mRNA "vaccine" causing adverse reactions? Without proper data, I'm going to avoid the "vaccine" on that risk alone.
0/0	What about risks of long term side effects?
0/0	What about the 'DYING' 'side effect' is that normal too then?
1/0	What about the 130,000 people that died
0/1	What about the Russian vaccine? I can't seem to find scientific papers about it (just political-biased news) and it's the only one that's coming soon to my country. Plus there are news talking about renal and circulatory problems that happened to people in the test phases that they kept in secret until now. That's not that alarming but it is pretty unconfortable to decide about getting a vaccine with that kind of doubts.
0/0/0/0	What about the ingredients? Never hear about them. No thank you!
0/0/0	What about the man that died from it right after getting it today in the media idk if it happened today or yeaterday n he wasnt old that I know of
0/0	What about the nano technology particles in the vaccination and the long term safety implications of nano particles in the human body and for what reason .
0/0	What about the stories of babies who have a life of suffering after a vaccine? What about toddlers who cease speaking and develop autism after a vaccine? Did you know that 1 in 30 children in California are autist? And that 10 years ago it was 1 in every 1000? Did you know that the same symptoms of mercury poisoning are the same as autism?
0/0	What about those cases in Norway where 23 people died after getting the jab?
1/0	What age group is eligible now in almost March 2021?
1/1	What annoys me the most is that Melissa is anti-vax because her daughter can't get vaccinated so her daughter actually relies on herd immunity to not get seriously sick. Yes there are certain cases where vaccines are bad for a specific person but in my opinion I believe that this is all the more reason to be pro-vax because then you rely on herd-immunity to survive.
1	What anti-vaxers don‚Äôt get is that the chances of dying from Covid are MUCH higher than dying from the vaccine
1/1	What anti-vaxxing is bad I never knew this It's not like vaccines are a theoretical suit of power armour or anything Lmao But seriously I don't understand why people don't vaccinate It's like going to a casino but not collecting any rewards you make It's just Stupid
0/0	What are the long term effects? What about what it does to pregnant women and their babies? Oh wait, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen yet.
0/0	What are the long term side effect? We do not know yet. We don't know what would happen in a year or 2. Or 10, 20 years. They don't even know if it will stop you from getting the virus.
0/0	What are the true ingredients of covid vaccine? Me & my family won't be taking it!
0/0	What are they doing with the DNA? The AstraZeneca people came out with 1st without testing.im not taking any of the crap!!!!
0/0	What are we rats used for tests and having no control over our selves. Choose your poison. None fore me please!
0/1	What are you all afraid of? It is not us who ask questions that are afraid. We don't non comply because we are scared...it's quite the opposite really. Much harder to watch the masses become storm troopers than it is to wear a mask
1/1	What are you going to do if people start dropping dead from the virus? Take the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0	What concerns me is that safety tests can only test for known problems, unknown problems are only revealed by time.
0/0	What did i say? This has been over, i proved atleast 1 death from vaccine, we can conclude its not 100 % safe or necessary ..
1/1	What do anti-vaxxers and Russian roulette players have in common? They risk their lives.
0/-1	What do you have to say about astra Zenica‚Äôs vaccines being stopped in a few countries due to blood clotting issues. All who had this issue were healthy with no immune issues and no other health concerns so is this something to be concerned about?
1/1	What do you want us to do? Stay locked up indoors? Any person will take their chance to rid society of this pandemic by taking the vaccine. It‚Äôs killing the people not just medically but socially, mentally, physically, financially and emotionally.
1/1	What ever happened to "If it save one life"
0/1	What ever happened to herd immunity through letting your immune system do it‚Äôs job
0/-1	What exactly is the vaccine supposed to be for? If it really works, then why do people still need to take such precautions?
0/0	What good is a vaccine that is supposed to especially help the frail and vulnerable if it kills them.
0/0	What happened to .....My body, my choice! I guess they conveniently forgot that line now that the narrative doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
0/1/-1	What happened to flu season, no more ,it's gone.
0/-1	What happened to the immune system God gave us to fight off viruses? My hope is the covid will settle down during the spring just like the cold/flu season do.
1/1/1/1	What happened to trusting the scientific community and your doctors?
0/0	What happens if u take the vaccine and something bad happens....u can't sue them.
0/0	What happens when you take a perfectly healthy body with a great immune system and inject it with things like formaldehyde, polysorbate 80, human DNA, pig, dog and monkey DNA and live viruses? The answer is not ‚Äúit makes the body healthier and stronger‚Äù.
0/-1	What has science ever done for us? TV Off.
0/-1	What if it contains micro scopic metal particles. Making you a better 5g antennae
0/0	What if the vaccine they're rushing to make is the thing that causes the REAL pandemic?
0/1	What if you find out 5-10 years later if it does major organ damage? You cant sue them. Govt has provided vaccine companies with liability protection. So you are screwed!
0/0	What if you have an underlying autoimmune condition? I'm concerned about vaccines triggering a flareup.
1/1	What is a vaccine ? Vaccine is : death virus ( basicly ) Why we need it ? There is no medicine yet effected to this virus ; our only wappon is our anticors ! And when we got vaccineted , our body learns the new virus and starts making anticors... so we got ummin What if we dont get vaccinated ? Then we will meet the original virus ! And our body will start producing anticors also , but this will take time and will be after the virus gets all over the body.. Can we still survive ? Yes of course ! %99 ! But if u get vaccinated , your body will learn the virus and yor chance will be : %99.99 What about side effects ? There will be side effects , like all the other vacvines ! And now my question : what about the side effects of the real virus ? After they stay in yor body for weeks , after they conqouer yor livers , vines , throat ! Have u ever though about the side_effects of the covid 19 ? Anyway.. the choise is yors.
0/0	What is going on in the world, is truly bizarre! To the extent that in just the past few short months, all virology and immunology textbooks ever printed in existence, are being re-written as we speak, the premise to all empirical scientific methodology, logic and reason.
0/0	What is going on right now, is known in epidemiology as the pathogen endemic equilibrium phase, (viral stasis) and is perfectly normal. Virulence weakening and dilution is what always happens when mutations and naturally acquired herd immunity is occurring throughout the populations. Invariably mutation causes infection rate increase and lethality rate decrease. Vaccination at this stage, is essentially pointless.
0/0	What is potentially dangerous: rushing the approval process, then rolling it out admitting you are not sure how effective it will be, and admitting you need to measure the results on UK population before affirming fully its effectiveness. Covid vax scepticism is healthy.
0/1	What is scaring me is in a google search any alternative views about the vaccine are being filtered out. Maybe we need to remember the HIV Aids crisis. That has never gone away, people just manage to live with it. There is no cure
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	What is scaring me is in a google search any alternative views about the vaccine are being filtered out. Maybe we need to remember the HIV Aids crisis. That has never gone away, people just manage to live with it. There is no cure.
0/0	What is sense taking vaccine if it does not guaranty anything. A local male got paralyzed after taking vaccine.
0/0	What is stopping me from getting the shot at this point is when I research how many people have DIED from the vaccine the information is not there. I‚Äôll read something and the next day it will be gone. I‚Äôm actually scared of the vaccine more than covid.
1/1	What is taking so long? How can you sit on the sideline because 1 person died from a theory while thousands are dying everyday while you‚Äôre analyzing out an abundance of caution. Move it!
0/0	What is the benefit of the vaccine when people are still getting infected even after taking it. UNICEF, does this vaccine guarantee a safeguard against the virus? If not, stop fooling innocent people.
1/1	What is the concern here? Why are some hesitant to take the vaccine? As long as the pharmaceuticals only use covid specific mRNA strands, we should be ok.
0/-1	What is the need to be vaccinated if the vaccines
0/0	What is the need to be vaccinated if the vaccines 1. Doesn't give you immunity 2. Doesn't eliminate the virus 3. Doesn't stop you from spreading it
0/0	What is the vaccine for? I know people who got the vaccine and still got COVID
1/1	What is there to see with their own eyes? News reporting that there aren't in fact thousands of people dying because of the vaccine? Amazing!
1/1	What is up with all the people refusing the vaccine?? Just get the jab people!!!
0/1	What is your age? My mother is 58 and took the vaccine 4 days ago, she‚Äôs experiencing soreness and a lot of fatigue. Immediately after the vaccine she reported dizziness. I‚Äôve definitely noticed the decline in her energy and loss of focus since then
0/0	What it say's to me is the younger people are being forced into taking the deadly vaccine . That is a choice of the individual .
0/0	What kind of business entity applies for and gets zero liability or accountability for the effects of its products, and then proceeds to distribute it worldwide? A CORRUPT one, that's what kind!!!
1/1	What matters after the single dose is not the number of cases, but the number of severe infections. If one dose prevents 100% of hospitalizations and deaths from covid that is more than adequate.
0/0	What people don't understand is that Western Medicine is built for profits not cures. Just imagine if every disease and illness known to man is cured. How will these pharmaceutical, CDC and FDA make their money??? So remember this when you go to a doctor or deal with insurance companies or medication all of this are made for profits only. No one ever in the history of medicine talks about boosting the immune system the frontline to fighting off bacteria and viruses. These drugs that put out in the markets are designed purposely to have side effects to keep you depending on Western Medicine.
1/1	What people don‚Äôt seem to get is that if you are low risk and not personally worried about Covid, when given the choice, you are more likely to choose a better vaccine. Pfizer/Moderna are both higher effectiveness and come with no bad press. Can anyone actually say if they had a choice between AZ and one of the above they are choosing AZ? It offers no advantages. I am pro-vaccine. People also need to understand that wanting to get the best vaccine is not that crazy a concept.
0/0	What people learn from history, is that people never learn from history. I'm not taking any mRNA created from eugenicists
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
0/0	What should scare you even more is it‚Äôs changing your RNA; your bodies blueprint and the changes are permanent and irreversible. Gates wants to depopulate by 3 billion. He plans on doing this with vaccines.
1/1	What so many anti vaxers choose to ignore is that most of them are enjoying healthy lives because of the childhood vaccination programmes.
0/0	What the f***!!! Big pharma should test their mRNA vaccines with these two pathetic weirdos. They are creepy as hell. Now I'm really really scared.
0/0/0	What the hell is going on bowing down on earthly things.No one on earth will escape death.everyone will go through the same process so believe the creator of humans and not vaccines.
0/-1	What the professionals are not saying is that when you've already had the covid you do not need the vaccine as you already have the ANTIBODIES. And is Been proven through studies the ANTIBODIES stay with us for life. Also, even on the CDC website, which keeps on changing of course because Dr Faucci keeps on changing his "opinion", it says people with preexisting condition and compromised immune system, as well as pregnant women should not take the vaccine. I've had the ANTIBODIES for over a year already, through which my doctor found out i had the virus even after a tested negative twice, and although I go through lingering symptoms, I'm fine. As well as many of my large family. I would if anything, recomend to take the ANTIBODIES test instead of taking the vaccine.
1/1	What these people don‚Äôt understand is yes, your child may have had a bad reaction to a vaccine so in cases like those, of course they shouldn‚Äôt be getting vaccinated, but that‚Äôs why people who don‚Äôt have reactions should be vaccinated, so that the people who aren‚Äôt able to, like your child, are protected
0/0	What universe is 40,000 participants a good number ?- especially when most Conditions take 1 yr to show itself ! A 2 month window is a joke and anyone who can't see that nor bring it up is a joke.
0/-1	What virus???
1/1	What we also need is less Americans to refuse the vaccine!!!
1/-1	What we need to know is when the public can get there's and can we go on line to sign up
0/0	What will the covid vaccine do to my body? That‚Äôs a simple question, not a damn thing
1/1	What wonderful news... I am getting ready for Vaccine # 2 next week. I pray it protects us Maderma ones as this.. I could cry from this Fantastic news. Lord thank you for now the United States and the entire world to be vaccinated will be a miracle... . We are going to be on our way to being Covid- free. Remember to continue in using the masks.. But Pray to the CREATOR to Protect you and your loved ones every day and night...
1/-1	What would be convincingly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù though? 40,000 subjects and 0 deaths? 1,000,000 subjects and 2-3 deaths? Absolute safety is really hard to prove. The risk in the meantime is your chance of getting Covid before you get vaccinated multiplied by your chance of getting long term side effects or dying from Covid, and then multiply those same risks for whoever you might spread it to. There is some risk in waiting for longer term data. I would get it if offered (and FDA cleared) as my wife and I are both high occupational exposure, but she‚Äôs pregnant and we have a toddler too so they won‚Äôt be getting it anytime soon.
1/1	What would be really cool is if these vaccines reached around the whole world to the point many of these viruses would go extinct.
0/0	What would be the purpose of a vaccine for something with a natural survival rate of nearly 100%?
0/0/0/0	What you NEED to know is that NOBODY knows the long term effects.
1/1	What you are doing is truly dangerous. If this virus is not controlled utilizing real medical science & research the situation we are in could last for years. It was tested thoroughly. It is being rolled out in phases. Allow it to work. This is bigger than your show & ratings.
0/0	What you really need to know is that a very high percentage of medical staff won't take these deadly vaccines.
1/1	What's amazing is that vaccines have been so good at protecting us that some people forgot how great they are. They just think, oh it's just a flu when it's literally malaria, one of the world's greatest killers.
0/0	What's dangerous is those who don't even consider anything outside the info. they are given by Govt and the vaccine companies. Vaccines companies are in this to make a huge profit and help the Gov. agenda. That's it. This is why Gates moved away from computer software.
0/0/0/0	What's not to trust about a for profit, already paid for, rushed vaccine? I'll hold off and let others be the real world testers thank you.
0	What's the technology used in the vaccine? And why? What for? My Body belongs to God and His Holy Spirit lives in me, Jesus Blood Protects me from plagues. So, No thanks! Only Trust God, and not man.
0/-1/0	What's the use of 90% efficacy when you can't get your manhood up six months later?
0/0	What? The population is just genuine pigs for all kinds of experiments - no accountability.
1/0	What? You seem to not only not understand how the phases of the vaccine trials work, but also that speed and haste are different things. No steps are being missed.
0/0	Whatever happened to the natural immune, the best defence system against viruses?
1/1	Whatever it was it wasn't the vaccine.
1/1	Whatever, as long as the vaccine keeps my chances of a serious illness at 0% I‚Äôll get it every year like I do the flu shot
0/0	What‚Äôs in the vaccine? Like the specific chemicals or whatever that make up the COVID 19 vaccine.
0/0	What‚Äôs next? Your local dealer making a vaccine, don‚Äôt know how we can trust these people. He said a ‚Äòdecent‚Äô vaccine üíâ decent isn‚Äôt good enough
0/0	What‚Äôs nuts is injecting everyone over a illness which is less dangerous than riding a bike ... your going to inject 30million people under 40 for a illness which in this second wave has claimed the lives of only 20 people under 40 ...
0/0	What‚Äôs the password for the 5G hotspot microchip they implanted in you?
0/0	What‚Äôs the point of a vaccine when you still have to wear a face muzzle and be socially distant!
0/0	Whe all be transformed in mutants, like Wolverine!
1/0	When Anti-Vaxxers refuse they vaccine they must also be made to sign a waiver that neither them or any of their family will receive treatment by the NHS when they catch COVID-19, and they are locked in quarantine until they die/recover. Simples!
1/1/1	When I call high risk patients with COVID, I am so relieved when I hear they had a prior vaccine. If it is one dose or two, Pfizer or moderna, time and time again, their symptoms seem milder. In some cases, it likely saved their life. Get vaccinated when you have the chance.
0/0	When I can see documented studies outlining long term effects, I‚Äôll consider it. Until then, I will pass.
1/1	When I get my second vaccination it will be on my grindr profile and I'm very OK with that.
1/1	When I get the vaccine I hope I would get the War Hammer titan.
0/0	When I got the flu shot I was in the hospital for 2 weeks never again as far as covid shot I‚Äôm not sure I will
1/1	When I had my COVID-19 jab I had a slight sore arm for two days and that was it,Surely that‚Äôs got to be better than risking getting COVID-19
0/0	When I think of the things that make me trust scientific work, speed isn't on the list.
0/0	When I was young, one of my friends woke up paralyzed from the waist down one morning after receiving a vaccine. I think vaccines are great, but there's no way in hell anybody will force me to take one that I don't want. I think I'll let the rest of the world get the Covid vaccine, then there will be reputable data to base my decision to either get it or not on.

1/0	When I'm suppose too? I will decide when and where I'll take anything!
1/1	When a population takes vaccines, it leads to a herd immunity effect.
1/1	When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries
1/1	When a scientist tells me that the research says it would be helpful to my comfort and wellbeing to take a vaccine, I'm going to take it. And I would urge my constituents and all others who may have any confidence in my opinion to please follow the scientists and get vaccinated.
0/0/0	When a vaccine is safe and effective you don‚Äôt need to promote it no?
1/1	When and where can I get it?

0/0	When are the rest of these poisons going to be "paused"?
0/0	When big phama makes you sign at least 4 liability release forms before you even get the vaccine, well this should tell you something. Also one of my concerns is people think that when they get both vaccinations they can let there guard down and that is a mistake

0/0	When falsehood becomes institutionalized, truth is seen as rebellion. I will not get the vaccine.
1/1	When filling out the registration forms for the drive thru vaccination sites, is it necessary to fill out the reason for the appointment? I really want to get this done as fast as possible.
0/0	When has there ever been a time in history when the people who shut down freedom of speech and enforce untested v@x ci nes been the good guys ?
0	When it 'normally' takes between 10 to 15 years to develop such a vaccine and one miraculously comes out in a few months . . . . no wonder I'm sceptical! AND, to add further suspicion, the leading provider insists on the buyers signing a liability disclaimer . . . . what am I supposed to think?
1/1	When it becomes available to the non essential public I will be the first in line.. protecting my own. And my elders.. sleves rolled up read to go.
1/1	When it comes to vaccines it‚Äôs important to not allow perfect to be the enemy of good. All indications are that we now have several very good vaccines that can save many lives. While none of them are 100% effective against a mutating virus they are still very powerful weapons that should eventually allow us to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Thank God and the scientists for that.
1/1	When it's offered I'm going to take the vaccine.

1/1	When people trust cigarettes more then they trust a COVID vaccines üòÇ
0/0	When pharmaceutical reporters are praising something, then I guess that qualifies as an advertisement.
1/1	When presented with an opportunity for a vaccine, don‚Äôt wink at it, grab the opportunity. It could be the difference between life and death.
0/0	When someone says "just because it's safe" in regards to an experimental vaccine should give us pause. Remember DDT was "safe"!
1/1	When someone suddenyl become knowledgable about how vaccine can be developed just by google searching stuff. And then dismiss all valid scientific evidences.. Yea you have the right for your opinion but science is not based on Opinions but on facts and evidences and discrediting years of research and such is soooo bafflinf at best.
0/1	When someone who was PCR "positive" for Covid dies in a motorcycle accident: they say "+1 covid 19 death". When someone dies just after getting the Covid "vaccine" they say "he would have died anyway, just a coincidence, not the vaccine".
0/0	When the CURE is WORSE than the DISEASE then you NEVER TAKE the damn CURE!
0/0	When the government says safe and effective so many times I know I should run for the hill

1/1	When this is all over the UK people will be thanking the goverment for their Covid rollout program which got the country back on its feet long before anyone else.

I come from a time when polio was still a scourge and none of my friends, or I, had the chance of a ' jab ': some were left with marked deformation, I was lucky with just a thinner left leg and shoulder higher than the other. Unfortunately my being canted to the right was a major factor in my spinal problems as I grew older, resulting in major surgery in my 30s.

0/0	Whichever way they spin it, the simple facts are the corona vaccine doesn't really work but there's too much money riding on it, they have to push it.
1/0	While I appreciate that the vaccines were fast tracked. It seems based on the millions worldwide who have been vaccinated over the past 6 months, and the statistically small number of issues people have experienced, there is enough "evidence" about their safety and efficacy. I'd rather get vax'd and reduce my possibility of death and long term health risks, than go unvax'd and risk death and chance of taking others with me on the way out. Vaccines are a less potent version of a virus that enables your immune system to more successfully fight it off. If you have an issue with the safety of vaccines, then you should also have an issue with not wearing a mask. Getting vax'd seems a lot safer than living in the unmasked South. You're getting exposed either way. Same experiment, just different controlled level of risk.
1/1	While I'm happy and fortunate to be part of the first 8% nationally to get the #COVID19Vaccine , let's hope the next 62% needed for #HerdImmunity do not need to wait many months! #VaccinesWork

0/1	While the vaccine was developed in record time it is important to know that it has passed all the necessary requirements for emergency use authorization than any other medicine or vaccine requires.
0/0	While your information wasn't useful at all !.you're upbeat and positive personalities make me more scared than ever before !. It comes off very stepford wivesy !. And the fact that you're expected to take this for lack of better words experimental vaccine.and no one knows what the side effects are going to be I mean no one knows what the side effects are going to be. And the government makes it where you cannot hold them liable for damages !. No I don't buy a car without a warranty !you're not going to put a experimental vaccine inside of my body and tell me well it may work it may not work and who knows what it's going to do !. When your kidneys are shut down, your heart is firmly damaged, and your kidney cease to function because of this experimental vaccine. And you and your family have no recourse financially.Because the government decided that there will be no liability to this vaccine yeah I don't think that's fair !. I'm not going to be pfizers guinea pig !.stay safe people and take the vaccine I think all of you should take the vaccine !.
1/-1	Whilst I agree that it is much better to have the vaccine than risk Covid, the statistics James uses are not correct though. He says that one in every thousand people that get the virus in the U.K. die of it. If that were true and given that yesterday we heard that there were 70k deaths it would mean 70m people have already had the virus in the U.K.. if that was true we would not need a vaccine?
1/1	Whilst I agree that there needs to be more transparency between the government and the public to curtail scepticism in its many forms, I think that if people believe the vaccine is harmful and don‚Äôt want it, leave them be. Have them sign an agreement that they refused the vaccine and if they contract Covid, they have to cover their own treatment.

I'm living proof! I've done everything normal, been everywhere i wanted to go, including packed bars, have never worn a mask, and I haven't even had a cold in well over a year!!!! Am I lucky, F no!

I wonder if they are trying to save us or justify their decision.

0/0	Why the mad rush to vaccinate people with a highly experimental and untested vaccine that won‚Äôt stop you getting it or spreading it!? For a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate?!!
0/0	Why the name COVID-19? There is no D in corona-virus. Operation COVID-19 stands for certification of vaccination ID plus the year it was implemented. Look it up.#COVID19 #vaccines #ArtificialIntelligence
0/0	Why the propaganda for a dangerous experimental vaccine that is not even a medically defined vaccine? They are really promoting this for one reason only! Wake up! Keep yourself and your immune system healthy and people will be just fine till we reach herd immunity!
0/0	Why vaccinate already infected/recovered = faster way to get R&D vaccine cost back? No animal trials for these vaccines. Why not distribute Vitamin D and Ivermectin like India???? Follow the money.
0/0	Why vaccinate when no one is sick. It should be freedom of choice, stop taking away our civil rights
0/0	Why vaccine for everyone?
0/0/0/0/0/0	Why vaccine manufacturers have zero liability if their vaccines are safe?
1/-1	Why when anything to do with Covid is selling out left and right ,that‚Äôs the economic boost people üñïüèΩüñïüèΩ
0/1	Why would I get a vaccine that poses no threat to me and people like me?
1/0	Why would I get a vaccine that: 1. Has had no studies done on the long term effects 2. Treats a virus that I'm not concerned about contracting 3. Does nothing to prevent the transmission of the virus to others?
0	Why would I need a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.98% survival rate?
1/0	Why would I take a vaccine that was rushed to the public with hardly any testing and now they are saying it‚Äôs only good for 6 months. I‚Äôll take my chances on a 99% survival rate if I get it!!!
0/0	Why would I take a vaccine when 2 times now I have tested positive. Ridiculous.
0/0	Why would I take a warped speed experimental gene therapy for a cold virus with a 99.98% recovery rate?
0/0	Why would I vaccine against the cold? 2 million dead this past year... how many died from the flu or the cold the years before covid world wide? I got covid and got over it no issue I was kinda sick for a week. Now I‚Äôm immune to it or at least will handle it much better.
0/0	Why would I want to inject what I don‚Äôt want in my body?
0/0/0	Why would a person under 30 take a vaccine that is not verified. Why would any one receive a vaccine when pushed by the deep state controlled CDC and the WHO. I say no to the false pandemic and an experimental vaccine
0/0	Why would a vaccine be considered necessary for an illness with a survival rate of 99.97% if you actually catch it?... If rate of cancer deaths was reduced to 0.03% it would be considered a miracle.
0/0	Why would any healthy under 30 year old want to take this??
0/0	Why would anybody get a vaccine from these corporations, when the first step taken with the vaccinations was corrupt politicians signed legislation preventing lawsuits against said corporations when their vaccines caused illness or death?
0/0	Why would anyone consider getting a "vaccine" that alters your DNA?
0/0	Why would anyone inject a vaccine employing a brand-new platform with ZERO long-term safety data, for a disease that has basically no chance of killing them?
0/0	Why would anyone take a vaccine that not even the owners of the company that made them won't
0/0	Why would anyone take a vaccine when you can? sue the vaccine corporations for damages it? like driving a car without insurance but much worse ?
0/0	Why would anyone under 50 even bother getting vaccinated. It's unnecessary.
0/0/0/0	Why would anyone wanna get this vaccine when the case fatality rate for those under 70 is .01% and the vaccine process which take 7+ years to develop safety was done in 10 months?
0	Why would anyone want injected with a defective chimpanzee adenovirus that AstraZeneca made called chadox1-s?
0/0	Why would anyone want this in their body?... Has everyone gone nuts?... Yeah why not!... Lets all play Russian Roulette with those lovely side effects we never had before!... Yeah... Great... lots have died now...
0/0	Why would someone get a vaccine if 10 percent gets the virus.
0/0/0/0	Why would someone get a vaccine if 10 percent gets the virus. Hummm
0/0	Why would someone need a vaccine if he recovered from the virus
0/0	Why would someone want to play Russian roulette with their health?
0/0	Why would the vaccine protect against different strains and not natural immunity? Come on dude. Don't just eat up everything the government says, ask some basic common sense questions.
1/1	Why would they even need to kill people with vaccines like that when there are nukes? It'd be a lot quicker.
0/0	Why would this be longer lasting than the immunity acquired by people who have already recovered from Covid-19
0/0	Why would we listen to anything WHO has to say. They have compromised themselves when they hid the truth of this pandemic from us.
0/0	Why would we need a vaccine when there are medications that work?!
0/0	Why would you need the mRNA vaccine to help your immune system when all you have to do is take your vitamins and eat a good Balance diet
0/0	Why would you take a medicine (vaccine) not YET approved by the FDA?
0/0	Why would you take a untested vaccine for a virus that's 99.9% survivable and only inflicts the elderly with pre-existing health issues?
0/0	Why would you want a vaccine for a virus that‚Äôs never been isolated? A virus so deadly it‚Äôs cured the flu
0/0	Why would you want to give essential workers an experimental "vaccine"? It hasn't even been shown to prevent contagion.
0/0	Why would young healthy people need a vaccine
0/0	Why you are giving this microchip for people....You are shameless
1/1	Why? Is it bcs of blood clots? It's a very rare thing. 4.6 cases out of 1 million shots.
1/1	Widespread vaccination for the coronavirus means that the virus will not infect as many people. This will limit spread through communities.
1/1	Wife getting the Covid vaccine. A huge relief. Phew.
1/1	Will I do it? Probably yes, although I'll definitely leave the first batches for those who actually need it.
1/1	Will I do the vaccination? Probably yes
1/1	Will I take the COVID Vaccine? Yes. Do I trust it will work? Yes. Do I think that once I have the vaccine, I am immune to COVID-19? No. I would still take reasonable precautions till this whole thing blows over, but I will feel a lot better about things. Vaccines do not create immunity‚Ä¶they enhance your resistance to the disease.
0/0/0	Will NEVER get the vaccine
1/1	Will definitely do when available to me but health care workers and others need it way more than us right now
1/1	Will get a vaccine because getting a case of COVID-19 would require hospitalization.

0/-1	Will happily go to the wire on this one...if you intent to try and force this on me expect force in return...
0/0	Will not be taking a vacation for the Chinese virus
0/0	Will not comply! Informed Consent would involve both long-term data on the experimental technology and no duress what so ever to make health care choices for myself including taking a "vaccine" ie: Untested mRNA genetic modification technology. Any attempt to prevent people from traveling is patently repulsive to all free people.
0/0	Will not get the vaccine
0/0	Will not take due to the vaccine distribution.
1/1	Will probably give the vaccine to my kids
1/1	Will recommend it to family and friends.
0/0	Will the mainstream media be giving as much airtime and an updated tally for everyone who has been harmed, disabled or died by having the vaccine, in the exact way that they have reported on the daily amount of people testing positive or dying with the virus?
0/0	Will this vaccine program really make any difference when a estimated 40% say they will not taking it?And now reports of suspension of injection's for any one with a allergic reaction response history.Obviously drug company protecting it back from litigation if adverse effects become a issue?
0/-1	Will u take responsibility of the side effects caused to others?
0/-1	Will we have to carry a vaccination certificate for when the Gestapo ask to see our papers?
0/0	Will we young people bear children in future? We will have to wait and see
1/0	Will you have to have booster shots ? , course you bloody will. Lots of money in vaccines .
0/0	Wish I could convince my Grandmother to not get the second shot. I'm terrified for her, she doesn't understand that shes risking her life more by getting the shit.. I mean shot.. than she was by NOT getting it. At 83, and healthier than most people I know that are half her age, she just wont listen to the bad reports from the damn vaccine!
1/1	Wish I could get a vaccine!
1/1	Wish I could get it here in Mexico.
1	Wish I could show this to my dad so he‚Äôll let me get vaccinated (I‚Äôm an essential worker) but it would only lead to an argument or me getting kicked out
1/1	Wish they would hurry up in the Netherlands. So far only ~2/18 million have been vaccinated.
1/1	Wishful thinking, but I‚Äôm going to choose to trust if Biden and Fauci said it‚Äôs happening, it‚Äôs happening. That being said, I‚Äôm fully prepared to be disappointed.
0/0	Wishing I never got Moderna. Hands have hurt every since.
1/1	With COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do. But until the vaccine is widely available, socially distancing and wearing masks will actually save even more lives, and alleviate the pressure on healthcare workers.
1/1	With Moderna switching to more doses in a vial, I presume they can increase shipments also? Or has that already been implemented?
1/1	With Yellow Stain gone and a vaccine in the pipeline ... 2021 is looking better already
1/1/1	With a mask, and a vaccine. Yup, those are great for you!
1/-1	With all due respect, what about the older people in nursing homes and first responders?
0/0	With current recovery rates and Ivermectin available. why bother ?Just looking at the various stats makes it clear we do not need to immunize the entire population. Save the money to improve and build our medical facilities.
1/1	With each shot that goes into someone's arm, we get closer to the end of this pandemic.
1/1	With my job description I wouldn't have a choice. Either way I would absolutely get vaccinated.
1/1	With so many not vaccinating and spreading eradicated viruses, I want more vaccines as fast as possible, especially mmr.
1/0	With stuff like this im okay with them saying, tough your getting it.
0/0	With the restrictions and vaccines we do our best to generate a stronger virus. The weak virus froms will disappear from the restrictions and vaccines, so the strong mutants can get ground.
1/1	With the super spreading variants here, it seems to me it's pretty simple - get the vaccine or get covid.
1/0	With the vaccine only reducing your risk of serious symptoms but not actually stopping you getting or spreading the virus nullifies the actual reason for a passport. If the vaccine actually stops you from getting the virus it would be a no brainer. I‚Äôm not against the vaccine at all. But i am against anything that‚Äôs completely inutile!!!!
1/1	Within 9 months we have five vaccines with excellent trial evidence & others to come
1/1	Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
1/1	Without Astrazeneca, Britain wouldn't be in the happy place it is today, with cases falling and deaths falling too (there were only 23 deaths yesterday, out of a UK population of 67 million).
0/0	Without having studies to prove this is effective, it is reckless to do this.
1/1	Without the vaccine, we can't go and watch the sports event live!
1/1	Without vaccination verification it's extremely unlikely that any International travel will be permitted in future It's doubtful this will impact heavily on many of the anti-vax people...because they know the earth is flat
1/1	Without vaccines we would still have polio, smallpox etc. I will have the jab as soon as it is offered.
1/1	Without vaccines, schools will not be able to fully re-open.
1/1	Without widespread vaccination, we will not be able to end this pandemic

1/-1	Women on BC are at a much higher rate to get blood clots than either the AZ or J&J vaccines are causing, and nobody is doing anything about it. What is this bullshit?
0/0/0/0/0	Won't be getting that vaccine for sure. Until years after where its guaranteed safe and has 0 side affects long term.
0	Won't be injecting poison into me.
0/0	Won't be taking any vaccine poison that messes with your DNA.
0/0	Won't have any side effects for me because I will never take it. My body my choice. If it's ok to say that to kill an unborn human being them what could be the problem.
0/0	Won't take it unless it's forced on me.
0/0/-1	Wonder how much Pfizer payed that ginger lad to hype it up
1/0	Wonder if the full dose caused an immune response against the viral vector
1/1	Wonder why people don't catch smallpox and polio nowadays. Oh, they have been vaccinated, including the anti-vaxxers!

1/1	Woohoo! Covid Vaccine booked for Wednesday!! Wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd still be classed as vulnerable after being discharged but very happy to be invited
1/1	Woohoo! I got my first Covid vaccine today! (We had to double mask while there.)
1/1	Woohoo! They're following the science. A 0.0006% chance of a clot *from* the jab is a MUCH smaller risk of a blood clot from catching covid, using birth control, or several other commonly prescribed substances.
0/-1	Woops, they died. ‚ÄúThis is how science works.‚Äù
1/1	Woot! Getting my first shot tomorrow! So excited to be apart of the stats.

0/1	Worst effects.... Does That include Death??
0/-1	Worst one out there, don't trust Russia.
1/0	Worth mentioning--the pope has told Catholics that it's a moral imperative to get the vaccine.
1/1	Would DEF get the vaccine - husband and I are both anesthesiologists and in patients airways all day everyday and we have an 8 month old at home. Would do anything to keep him from getting sick.
0/1	Would I call pro vaxxers paranoid ? Most definitely that ls a title that could fit many of them. They get so paranoid with any desease lol.
1/1	Would I love to have seen a 10 year study on the vaccine? Sure. That's not a thing we have the luxury of right now. First dose down
0/0/0	Would a person with more than 2 brain cells to rub together get this vaccine?
1/0	Would another way of looking at these deaths be this: the same people who are fatally vulnerable to Covid-19 are also fatally vulnerable to the vaccine for the same reasons? If this is a correct statement, then doesn‚Äôt this cast doubt on the benefit of this vaccine?
0/1	Would be great but there is very little evidence they work.

0/0	Would someone please explain why Trump is spending OUR MONEY on a poison vaccine, when there is already a cheap, plentiful, and tested treatment/cure for Covid?
0/0	Would you fly in an untested experimental aeroplane, If the answers no then ask yourself why would you allow an experimental untested biological pathogen that for the first time in human history that actually goes in to your DNA and alters it . How much do you trust the government's and multi trillion pound corporation's that in the past gave us: Thalidomide, Asbestos in baby powder, HIV contaminated bloods to haemophilic children, None of these assaults on humanity saw and prison sentences, they are about to do it again as the world's governments have cancelled legal recourse and public prosecutions resulting from adverse reactions. Keep your holiday, Keep your fancy restaurants, Keep your needs and follys, Keep your Autoimmune diseases, Keep your horrors of science, I'll keep my DNA and know that fear did not drive me to give up that which is truly MINE.
0/0	Wouldn't take it if my life depended on it. Because it doesn't

0/-1	Yeah I feel better. NOT! Its all adding up. I have suffered an anaphalactic reaction. Do not want to have another one
1/1	Yeah I want it. So hurry it up already. Let‚Äôs stop wasting good vaccine on the GOP pandemic deniers and give it to frontline workers/elderly and then me
1/1	Yeah I was so skeptical at first! I am glad I researched more about the vaccines. I'll take the first available! üòÅ
1/1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant.
0/0	Yeah I'd rather not become a guinea pig, but thanks anyway.
0/-1	Yeah I'll be rushing right down to Hannaford's to get a vaccine developed in less than a year with unknown long term effects to protect myself from a disease with a higher survivability rate than the flu.
0	Yeah I'll get the vaccine in the next life R IP
0/0	Yeah I'm not taking that garbage I'll take my 99.997% survival rate
1/1	Yeah I‚Äôm good getting vaccinated and not being dead
0/0/0/0	Yeah because everyone is so excited for vaccines. It wasn't good enough that we drink and eat posion now they want us to inject it in to us
1/-1	Yeah because people listen. My moms anti vax but I got all my vaccines because my doctor said ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to get some vaccines you should her XYZ‚Äù and she just said ‚Äúyes ok‚Äù.
0/0	Yeah fuck that. Not shooting up some mystery vaccine
0/0	Yeah give it to old people first, in a few years time they‚Äôll be dead which they‚Äôll simply put down to old age not this over exaggerated virus
0/0	Yeah good luck making me take it
0/0	Yeah im 32 and in great health, no vaccine for me, i simply dont need it. If i were forced to tho, based on my research id take the jandj one
0/1	Yeah it works preety well In truthful Europeans countries...not in nigeria where the scammers in government are in charge of funds and pallative. Shame.
0/-1	Yeah it‚Äôs dangerous for us to think outside public opinion... that means we‚Äôre probably doing something right üëçüëçüëç
0/0	Yeah let's talk about the shortening of the protein multiplication process and not go too deep on how the trial phase was rushed.
0/0/0/0	Yeah no thanks. I'll take my chances with the virus.
0/0	Yeah right Good luck with pushing that Johnson and Johnson Vaccine
0/0	Yeah right!! 143 deaths in UK shortly after vaccinating and government brush it under carpet as irrelevant due to underlying health issues. They‚Äôre the people we‚Äôre supposed to inoculating...how many deaths from these vaccines are acceptable??
0/0	Yeah they kill people don‚Äôt act like no one is dying from taking the vaccine B.G. The man who says we need to depopulate now all of the sudden wants to save the world with the vaccine, let that sink in
1/0/1/1/1/1	Yeah we are living in times that for the first time people are more afraid of a vaccine than the actual virus
1/0	Yeah yeah I know, low risk, take it anyway. We need kill shots in arms and sheep herd immunity.
0/0	Yeah you guys are gonna have to chase me down with a tranquilizer to get that shit injected in me. I'm straight on have fetal cells injected in my body.
0/-1	Yeah! right! I don‚Äôt believe a word of it and will never have it. The reason for my decision are to long to go into to here
0/0	Yeah, I am not taking that vaccine.
1/1	Yeah, I recon we‚Äôve got about 35-40% that are going to idiotically decline the jab...because ‚ÄúmUh FrEeDoMs!!1‚Äù
1/0	Yeah, I will take the shot too when im almost 80
1/1	Yeah, I'm drinking copious amounts of tea this morning too. Hey ho. We'll get through this sure enough. And spring has nearly sprung, then summer and by then we should all have had our vaccines.....
0/0	Yeah, I‚Äôm going to inject genetic material into my body because these two guys said it was OK
0	Yeah, I‚Äôm not taking a vaccine for this either.
1/-1	Yeah, my husband was just a little tired after his, so there's really no telling, I guess? But it seems almost over now, so yay!
0/0	Yeah, no I'm not sticking a rushed vaccine in me when masks can do most of the work (at least if the people I've read that from are true lol).
0/0	Yeah, no one is allergic to poison, its poison.
0/1	Yeah, no one wants a fake vaccine for a fake pandemic. Who could have imagined that?
0/0	Yeah, sure. We all really need to go through all this for a virus that only kills 0.3% of us anyway. Get lost.
0/0/-1	Yeah, that "rare immune reaction" is getting to be pretty common
0/0	Yeah, they sure aren't miracles, lol. As a survivor of two adverse events, I sure won't be taking this one.
0/0	Yeah, you can skip me in line
0/0	Yeah,id rather be in a gunfight than take a vaccination
1/1	Yeah. Everybody should take vaccine
1/0	Yeah. I'll wait until it's reasonably available and hopefully any side effects that may have been missed during the rushed approval have been found out.
0/0	Yeah. I‚Äôm at the point of not trusting any thing and any body ‚Äî‚Äî here in 2021.
0/-1	Yeah. The sheeple have lined up to receive the injection and now the consequences and repercussions are discovered...... SMH
0/0	Yeah... I think I will wait at least until there are a few more guinea pigs vaccinated first..
1/1	Yeahhh vaccination should be provided cuz this is only solution to control this pandemic
1/1	Yeahhh vaccination should be provided cuz this is only solution to control this pandemic.Healthcare should be vaccinated too
0/0	Yep for a virus that is 99.9% curable. SMH at how much stupidity is out there! Vaccine is more dangerous than the virus! My body my choice! I choose not!
1/1	Yep had my astra yesterday feeling good today
0/0	Yep of course you don't need the oldies you want to eliminate them as they are no longer productive!!! Murderers!!!!
0/1	Yep! Like I said my sons all up to date on his vaccinations I‚Äôm definitely a ‚Äúprovaxx‚Äù parent and don‚Äôt agree with the antivaxx movement. But it‚Äôs just not possible for a vaccine that has had less than a year of trials to be able to identify any long term side effects.
1/1	Yep, I'm probably not in the risk group (hashimoto's) but I will get it as soon as it's made available to me.
1	Yep, medical and vulnerable groups first, but after that, I'd be happy to be next.
1/0	Yep, took it for 12 years, back to back, side effects left-right and centre. Men are very lucky...not compulsory ok , but let‚Äôs be honest we have all felt pressured to take it from partners and society at some point. It does however have therapeutic properties for certain conditions and also lowers the risk of a certain type of cancer (whilst it increases the risk of a different one). It‚Äôs deemed safe , it‚Äôs broadly prescribed to women as young as 13. And this vaccine is even safer in that respect. Open your pill‚Äôs side effects leaflet- yeah, ‚Äúsudden death‚Äù is listed.
1/1	Yep. Lost my grandfather a few days ago to covid. I hope people can get this vaccine soon so no one has to deal with this any longer.
0/0	Yeppers..that's why I'm waiting. Never been positive for Covid.
1/1	Yes . Take the shots because the government says it good for you. Take the shots. The government knows exactly what you want and need. Do what they say and get used to to government control.
0/0	Yes ... We know how it will work ... Vaccines at least annually ... Different strains ... New vaccines! ... The pharmaceutical companies must keep making billions ... The media and governments pushing these "miracles" ... While the stories of those injured get covered up
1/1	Yes I am convinced that the vaccine is safe. We're talking about 95% efficacy or 90% efficacy way more than the typical 30 or 50 you get from the typical flu vaccination.
1/1	Yes I got my vaccine so did my husband and soon our 18 year old daughter so we can see and hug our grandchildren again soon
1/1	Yes I will have the vaccine when it is offered to me and I am well aware there is a risk. My sister-in-law, a healthcare professional had the vaccine 10 days ago and had a slight anaphylactic episode immediately after. She was OK after about half an hour.
1/1	Yes I will take it because I care about other people than just myself
1/1	Yes I will take the vaccine because I'm a teacher and I want to get back in my classroom with my students asap.
1/1	Yes I'm absolutely 100% sure that both vaccines that have been discovered are safe. And I am absolutely 100% sure that Donald Trump is not safe and that if his lips are moving he is most likely lying. 100%.
1/1	Yes I'm taking the vaccine. I'm tired of masks.
0/0	Yes and I eat pink pancakes. No vaccine is safe. A vaccine in under a year is a joke. You can do little research to find out how useless flu vaccines are. For all of you getting the vax.. to a man made virus with a 99.8% survival rate ask your doctor about the vaccines ingredients, if you want fetus cells, Mercury and lead in your body then you deserve to have the vaccine.
1/1	Yes autism cases are rising, and we do not know yet what actually causes autism, but to say its vaccines is crazy. Studies have been done looking at millions of children and no correlation between vaccines and autism can be made. One possible cause for the increase of autism cases is our better understanding of the illness and we recently changed many of the global questionnaires for autism diagnosis around the time of the increase as well. I don't think anyone should force things to people, but for those who cannot get vaccinated, the vaccinated population is their only defence. I've had all my vaccines and I get a yearly flu vaccine.
1/1	Yes because I have put way worse things in my body! Lol. Bring on the vaccinations!
1/1	Yes because I'm not selfish. Just because it might not kill me doesn't mean I won't get someone sick and have it kill them.
1/1	Yes because getting Covid19 is not option me
1/1	Yes because it's important I do for those who cannot because of their health. I have a responsibility to keep up the heard imunity
1/1	Yes but covishield is effective post second dose. Side effects are common but vaccine should work for long term
0/1	Yes but refusing the vaccine is career limiting, as only NHS staff who have been vaccinated can work in front line, patient facing roles.
1/-1	Yes by taking the vaccine
1/1	Yes dr you are perfectly right all the front line workers should be vaccinated first they have and still are risking own lives to save others
0/-1	Yes half of the uk are smart
1/1	Yes i am, wanna get back outside enjoy nature, without governnentao restructions. Here in europe it causes Young deaths
1/1	Yes it is looking promising. It‚Äôs also technology and the type of vaccine that makes a difference as to why it‚Äôs happening faster.
1/1	Yes it will be fine. These things are not released without proper testing. Anti-vaxxers will disagree of course and you will see lots of silly comments on Facebook etc.. In the end you need make the decision you are comfortable with but for me, I am very happy to be vaccinated as soon as I can and I all those dear to me do too
1/-1	Yes missed my covid-19 shotüò´.....maybe NEXT weeküëç
0/0	Yes my elderly neighbour on one side of me was rushed to hospital last night with breathing problems 6 hours after receiving the vaccine and my other neighbours hand swelled up huge after he recieved his.
1/1	Yes of course I will, as soon as I can. I do not enjoy worrying constantly about being exposed to a dangerous disease. I want to be able to see my very elderly mother safely, to touch her. I cannot endanger her, so I must keep my distance. The vaccine is safe, a hell of a lot safer than viral infection. There is a new, highly transmissible variant reading rapidly around the world. The faster we can get vaccinated, the fewer of us will die, it is that simple.
1/1	Yes please take vaccine
1/1	Yes please vaccinate the stupidest ones firstly.. cheers mate
1/-1	Yes plss take
0/0	Yes pump that poison in those corrupt puppets
0/0/0/0/0	Yes thank you I'm an antivaxer, I have the right to choose
0/1/1	Yes the vaccine itself can in some cases cause a similar allergic reaction that the virus can. It‚Äôs extremely rare but obviously a potential side effect. Think of it as the non fatal form of covid - if you got covid, you‚Äôd have this reaction PLUS the other effects.
1/1	Yes! 90% of the drive thru vaccine stations are well done and efficient. It's incredible to me that we can tackle the biggest public health problem of our generation and the fix is free, fast, and drive thru.
1/0	Yes! Absolutely.There is nothing more dangerous than this vaccine than any others, or else they would not make it available.I thought at first that I would want to wait a while and see before taking it, but at this point, I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to wait. I‚Äôm 32, I am not an essential worker, and don‚Äôt have any health risks. I have several friends who work in healthcare and have already received the vaccine, and they are all happy and healthy. Soon everyone I know who is a teacher or social worker will get it too. It will be months before I am eligible to get one.
0/-1	Yes! I am more concerned about My child more than I am concerned with the population! Damn right!!!
1/1	Yes! I have taken the vaccine finally!!!
1/1	Yes! I want to protect myself.
1/1	Yes! I will get a vaccine as soon as I am allowed to
1/1	Yes!!!!!
1/1	Yes, I agree everyone should take the vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I believe that vaccines work
1/1	Yes, I finally received my first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine 2 weeks ago and I am hoping there will be enough supply to give me the second shot.
1/1	Yes, I had a combination of shoulder soreness, headache, fatigue, and malaise (i.e. general body achiness) that lasted ~48 hrs with the first dose, and ~60 hrs with the second one. I got both doses on Fridays, and luckily I had already had both following weekends scheduled to be off. I felt ready for work again the next Monday both times. I think my experience is typical, but some people get no reaction, while others get a low-grade fever or take an extra day to feel better. Overall, it was so totally worth it to be significantly protected against infection!
0/0	Yes, I have done extensive research, and I will NOT risk my life on getting this vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I plan to get the vaccine. People who are more at-risk should be able to get it before me, but getting vaccinated is something that will help stop the spread of the disease, and I'll be able to go see my little nephew
1/1	Yes, I probably would. I'd like to do some more traveling in the future.
1/1	Yes, I will get the vaccine once it is developed.
1/1	Yes, I will get the vaccine once it is developed. I will go one step further. I will get the vaccine even in the experimental stages.
1/1	Yes, I will surely take the Covid 19 vaccine. This will help me in getting protection against the dreaded virus.
1/1	Yes, I will surely take the Covid 19 vaccine. This will help me in getting protection against the dreaded virus. The present vaccine developed by Covid 19 has undergone a three level clinical trial and has been certified by both the international as well as Indian health agencies. There has not been any life threatening situations reported so far by the candidates who have taken the vaccine. So in my opinion it is safe to take the vaccine and we should surely take both doses of the vaccine, as the first dose will produce
1/1	Yes, I will take the vaccine. I thought I would try to slip past in some queue if possible. So that I can take my second dose soon.
1/1	Yes, I will. I'd rather be a guinea pig for any possible long-term effects for the vaccine than for long-term effects of Covid. That said, it'll be a while before I am eligible (30s, no co-morbidities).
1/1	Yes, I would accept the vaccination invitation. Advice is not to have any other vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I would get a COVID vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I would like to take vaccination
1/1	Yes, absolutely. If people don't get it this virus won't go away. If I don't get it I'm no better than the people I consider the problem
1/1	Yes, absolutely. That's the only way we'll stop the pandemic.
1/1	Yes, and I regard anti-vaxxers as criminals who should lose custody of their children.
1/1/1	Yes, as long as it's Pfizer or Moderna.
1/1	Yes, because I am an at-risk person and working in a high-risk job.
1/1	Yes, because the anti-vaxxer rhetoric is ridiculous and fucking retarded.
1/1	Yes, because the risks of a vaccination complication are small.
1/1	Yes, because the risks of a vaccination complication are small. Typically, the problem is an allergic reaction - anaphylaxis. The rate of anaphylaxis for these vaccines are 11.1 in a million. [1] In most cases of anaphylaxis, no treatment was required, just careful watching.
1/1	Yes, but as a healthy young person I'll probably be the last of the line.
1/1	Yes, definitely if a vaccine for Covid-19 comes out I'll get it, because we all know, we can't live our whole lives locked down
1/1	Yes, especially since I haven‚Äôt been in the UK since January and would like to visit my parents in 2021. But like some others said: I live alone, am a healthy amateur athlete in my 20s, do home office and don‚Äôt eat out at all, so I am really in no rush. Seeing my family a month or two later after a year without contact won‚Äôt be the end of the world.
1/1	Yes, i wanna protect those around me.
1/1	Yes, it is amazing that we have a vaccine and we can thank President Trump for Operation Warp Speed
1/1	Yes, it would be nice if we could get vaccinated. We are in category 1b, why are other groups being taken ahead of us? These vaccines and appointments are impossible to get.
1/1	Yes, parents should most definitely have their children vaccinated. Frankly there is a lot of complete bollocks out there about the alleged risks of vaccines - in reality vaccination is extremely safe, and much much much safer than running the risk of the infection the vaccine is intended to prevent.
1/1	Yes, polio was wiped out. Congratulations on bringing another idiot into the world.
1/1	Yes, research to date indicates the vaccines for COVID-19 have a very good safety profile.
0/-1	Yes, the WHO needs to stop spreading all its 'alternative facts'.
1/0/1	Yes, the key is getting mass-vaccination done in the developing countries. This isn't happening and its galling to see European (and other) politicians knocking and stockpiling AZ, when they could so easily be sent to those who really need them.
0/0	Yes, the truth is vaccines = bad. Although it's good to make lots of money by lies.
1/1	Yes, the vaccine hurts my arm. But it is worth it!
0/0	Yes, there is little demand. Even ~30% of nurses say they are hesitant to get the vaccine disregarding any limited supply.
1/1	Yes, this is truly a matter of life and death.
1/1	Yes, very much yes. there is the issue that if I do not take the vaccine, I can never visit my mother again, ever, since she has all the risk factors for COVID.
1/1	Yes, we are going back to normal, let the vaccine come in!
1/1	Yes, we are just one serious outbreak from disaster. The government should be getting as many vaccine variants in to this country so we can have the chance to at least pick and choose the vaccine we are prepared to risk having.
0/0	Yes, when you invest billions of dollars into vaccine development it becomes extremely difficult to allow a potentially better cheaper already existing option like Ivermectin on to the playing field.
1/1	Yes. Absolutely. My parents are high risk and elderly...I‚Äôd really hate to inadvertently kill them
1/1	Yes. Because I don't want to die of Covid19, or have my lungs or other organs damaged by it.My risk of death if I enter hospital because of Covid19 is around 1 in 60.
0/0/0	Yes. Brilliant. So glad to see so many people are standing up for themselves. You are not selfish for refusing a medical procedure which has zero benefit to you and may even have irreversible harmful effects.
1/-1	Yes. But I won‚Äôt be first in line. I want front line workers and high risk people to get it first. This also lets me see if there are any major initial side effects.
1	Yes. Definitely. The trials of the big ones look solid. I'm keen.
1/1	Yes. For the safety of those around me. I believe in science and the scientific community.
1/1	Yes. I will get the vaccine the second it‚Äôs available to me.
1/1	Yes. I will get the vaccine the second it‚Äôs available to me. I keep hearing everyone to tell me to ‚Äúdo my research‚Äù and I have a bit but I‚Äôm not arrogant enough to think that I can do research better then those who have dedicated their entire lives to it.
1/1	Yes. If you care about the people around you you‚Äôll get the vaccine. The developers have all guaranteed all safety measures will be followed and none will be avoided just to get it out quickly.
1/1	Yes. In fact it has been 48 hours since I received my first injection of the Pfizer vaccine.I have parents, and friends who are at risk. I may be able to brush COVID-19 off, but they can‚Äôt. >80% vaccination is required for herd immunity, and I want to protect them because I care for them.
1/1	Yes. My experience getting vaccinated was unreal. The efficiency was impressive.
1/1	Yes. My mother is being vaccinated tomorrow. I and ecstatic about it.
0/0	Yes. One side forcing the other side to do something against their will. That's what the Left does‚Ä¶
1	Yes. Properly tested on those valiant volunteers, and 95% effective, I‚Äôll get the vaccine as soon as it‚Äôs available. I certainly can‚Äôt depend on a huge portion of Americans to wear masks and socially distance; so a safe, viable vaccine is my only hope of getting back to a normal society. It worked for polio and small pox, and we had no reservations taking those vaccines‚Äîand wiping out those diseases. Of course, the loud anti-vaxers will come up with all kinds of b.s. concerning this new vaccine, and they can elect not to take advantage of it. But that Neanderthalish attitude will move me up in line. So, I‚Äôm good!
1/1	Yes. The miniscule possible dangers from vaccination are far outweighed by the dangers of contagious diseases.
1/1	Yes. Though I want to make sure people who aren't able to stay at home get it first which I believe is the plan in my state
1/-1	Yes. Type I diabetic.
1/-1	Yes. Why? Because I'd rather do something to protect my health and the health of others than bitch about conspiracies or "mah RIGHTS." Yes there's risks. Yes it's new. Yes the rollout has been a cluster fuck. But doing nothing won't improve anything for any of us. Fight me, I don't care.
1/1/1/1	Yes. Will take. It is the right thing to do. Same as with every other vaccine.
1/1	Yes... first day I can. Want life to get back to normal and feel it my duty to help protect the vulnerable
1/1	Yes.My parents and my extended family will be vaccinated before I am as they all work as nurses at the biggest hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Once my entire family is vaccinated, I‚Äôll finally be able to sleep better at night.
1/1	Yesss congrats, man! I get Pfizer 2 next week and can‚Äôt wait!
1/1	Yesterday I buried my father. Today I go home a different woman than the one whose father got a positive covid test in January 2nd. Thanks again to everyone who wears their masks, who has gotten or plans to get the vaccine, and who are keeping each other safe.
1/1	Yesterday I got a second dose of Sputnik, side effects are the same as the effects explained in the video.
1/1	Yesterday I got to hug someone in my family after more than a year. We both sobbed for a moment. Vaccines are awesome.
1/1	Yesterday I had my second Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	Yesterday United States vaccinated 2million in a single day. We are in a good position let‚Äôs increase the speed of vaccination drive
1/-1	Yesterday a guy in my neighborhood said I was pretty brave for getting my vaccine. He also says that covid is so weak people don't even know they have it so why get vaccinated?
0/0	Yet another political decision putting the people's best interests in jeopardy.
0/0	Yet many got sick and recovered without a vaccine. NATURAL anti bodies already protecting their system and you want to weaken their immunity again ?
0/0	Yet more dodgy experiments, Act of desperation
0/0	Yet somehow the deaths have gotten worse this month
1/-1	Yet the anti-vaxxers won‚Äôt be able to let this sink in but would happily believe the fake news off dodgy conspiracy theory pages
0/0	Yet they still want you to take that poison. These people are truly evil and have no soul.
0/0	Yet we should believe the BBC and there reports. Like when they interview 100 people but only show the 4 people that stand there and say how they carnt wait to have the vaccine.
0/0	Yet, nobody knows of anybody that knows anyone that has outright died of covid that wasn't already dying with multiple comorbidities! The same people bringing us these "miracle vaccines" have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population.
0/0	Yet, nobody knows of anybody that knows anyone that has outright died of covid that wasn't already dying with multiple comorbidities! The same people bringing us these "miracle vaccines" have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population. 2+2= ?
0/0	Yhea she looks healthy, really, John Hopkins. Aka Bill Gates cash, need I say more, wake up America
1/1	Yo I was on birth control pills for 20 years which came with a higher risk of blood clots than the J&J vaccine does. Why are y'all scaring everybody?
0/0	You ALL Will Be Brought Before the Most Holy Throne of GOD.......PUSHING this LIE!! \n NOT A VACCINE...VAXSCHEME!!\nGENE MANIPULATIONS/THERAPY!!,
1/1	You CANNOT GET CORONAVIRUS FROM THIS VACCINE. IT IS NOT A LIVE VACCINE. most likely they had covid already without knowing it when they got vaccinated. Please do some medical research.
0/0	You Forgot to mention that this mRNA uses human cells to reproduce itself, that could lead to DNA mutation and you have no study to proove otherwise
0/0	You actually believe those numbers??? Isnt it interesting that there was NO flu this year?! Because they counted the flu cases as the Wu flu! Take the blinders off people! And masks do absolutely nothing!
1	You actually don‚Äôt get the dead form of the virus. Your body receives something that tells it to learn what to do when/if you get the virus. It‚Äôs a whole new way of vaccines! It‚Äôs going to pave the way for cancer treatments in the future. It‚Äôs cool, scary, but super cool üòé
1/1	You all realize that if 75% of ppl take the vaccine we can go back to normal‚Ä¶ half of you all don't wanna take it because it takes you all don't wanna go to school
1/1	You answered the most important of my outstanding questions and I feel even more comfortable going to get the vaccine now. I'm so grateful to have come across this video today üôèüèΩ Useful. Concise. Educational. Yes, this video was all that!
1/1	You anti vaxxers are crazy! Take the vaccine!
0	You are 100% correct. All this for a virus with a greater than 95% recovery rate. What on earth had happened to common sense and perspective?
1/1	You are SAF....... IF YOU TAKE THIS!
0/0	You are a good brainless slave. The system loves people like you who are compliant, easy to control and don't think too much. Good luck with that vaccine that supposedly protects against a flu virus with over 99.5% survival rate.
1/1	You are correct, COVID #Vaccine is much better than the Symptoms of COVID infection, additionally it helps your body to build the natural #active immunity (#memory cells) that help your body from any upcoming #COVID19 infection
0/0	You are crazy and a fool. I care not if the creator of the vaccine is Muslim or Jewish or Christian. It is against all these 3 religions according to their Holy books. Just because a Muslim created the vaccine means not it is allowed for muslims to take it. Please seek help.
0/0	You are definitely not counting me in.
0/0/0	You are in the human trial right now you dunce cap. The australian health minister blurted this out on LIVE TV. An experiment in other words. No one knows what this will do in 6 months, 2 years, or when they next catch the common cold. I am so disgusted at the people who got this shot I feel no sympathy. I just hope they do not spread the poison to others somehow.
0/0	You are injecting coronavirus into my body
0/0	You are killing people, and we will not forget this.
1/1	You are making a great job! We believe in you! Coronavirus gives an opportunity for development - that's one strong positive aspect of this pandemic. I'm watching all of those scientists in awe, keeping my fingers crossed. That's why I believe in science
1/1	You are making the right decision. I‚Äôve had both of mine and despite the concerns it does give you comfort knowing that you should never need hospitalisation even if you catch covid. 43 million had vaccine 327 bad reaction, I‚Äôd say odds very much in your favour
0/-1	You are not allowed to hold the drug companies accountable. Nuff said
1/1	You are not forced to, but you are greatly encouraged to because your not only harming yourself but others.
0/0	You are not immune after the vax! THERE IS NO CURE FOR THE COVID!
1/1	You are right, it happened with the original sars vaccine. Scientists are now very aware of how and why this happens and are able to avoid it.
0/0	You are safer not taking their experimental poison.
0/0	You are soo intelligent, don't go for any vaccine.
0/0	You are submitting to be a lab rat
1/1	You are the troll, not Tony. Not vaccinating your children is the choice that kills. Raising your child in an environment with other unvaccinated children also kills. The amount of vaccinations we get could be a debate worth having, but nobody ever raises that point unless they attempt to use it to undermine vaccination entirely, effectively forcing sane people to dismiss them as lunatics, that prefer dead children over live ones. And please do remember that pulling numbers out of your arse serves the same purpose: telling people to dismiss your claims. Today we get vaccinated for 10 diseases in Denmark. We can go through the list if you want to. I definitely want to see your list! Until I see it I will assume that you are a deceitful person, perhaps a fraud and a liar - something 99% of people believe you are, and this is their reason for not contending with your arguments as they don't enjoy debating enough to debate people with such characteristics.

0/0	You aren‚Äôt going to vaccinate me thanks üëçüèª
1/1	You aren‚Äôt willing to get vaccinated then stay away from those of us who are. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù haven‚Äôt even offered it to the general public but it totally makes sense to kill your doctors and your front line workers üòÇüòÇ y‚Äôall ridiculous. When there are residents and board directors rushing to get vaccinated but we should take advice from YouTube comments and social media while not listening to people who have PhD‚Äôs in genetics & diseases. Don‚Äôt forget that the earth is flat & the moon is made out of cheese üòÇüòÇüòÇ

0/0	You can all take it but don‚Äôt make me or my Family that‚Äôs all I ask And good luck with a vaccine I hope it works out the best for you since there‚Äôs not much to know about it but I guess we‚Äôll find out in time more and more people that take it hope nothing bad happens to you all and end up being worse than the virus itself

0/0	You can either trust all the data collected is accurate and safe or you can use your critical thinking skills to wonder why you can't sue the companies for any side effects. If the margin of safety is so high, why negate the risk of lawsuits?
0/0	You can even put a picture of Jesus in it... I‚Äôm still not taking it

0/-1	You don't rush a vaccine to market.

1/1	You gotta work on the people that decline the vaccine or are skeptical. Do more commercials, something.
1/1	You guys are doing such a great job informing us about the vaccine! Thank you! <3
1/1	You guys are mad tripping. It‚Äôs literally 1 person on 1 mil ppl this happened with. You guys should read the side effects of ADHD medication or the pill for women. Way more dangerous than the vaccin. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt seem to care about that???
0/0	You guys do understand that being against the covid vaccine is not the same as being anti vaccines right?
0/0	You guys need to look deeper because these jabs are NOT good!

0/0	You guys shouldn‚Äôt take the vaccine. It‚Äôs a hoax right? There‚Äôs no virus right? So yea, ... don‚Äôt take it.
0/0	You guys skipped the step where the consumer researches everything and gains their own knowledge on what they'll be consuming instead of talking to a "medical professional." Look up the ingredients and what they do and consider whether you really need to take unnecessary drugs if you're a healthy individual with a strong immune system and you haven't gotten the virus yet.
1/1	You guys talk like we live in a perfect world governed by angels and all this pandemic is just a mistake caused by nature but now we have the vaccine and the vaccine is so good and just take it so we can all go back to our beautiful lives.
1/0	You had me until you said ‚Äúno risk‚Äù of getting what is being vaccinated against. This is inaccurate and misleading. We need unbiased truth. Thank you.
0/0	You hate yourself and freedom of choice.
0/0	You have NO excuse for not researching these vaccines. How can you allow yourselves to put this stuff in people knowing there has been absolutely no time to be sure of what this will do to people? You are making guarantees to a population that is becoming more aware. You will have to answer to GOD.
1/1	You have a better chance of having your Twitter handle stolen than getting a blood clot from the vaccine ;)
1/1	You have a choice: you can save your life and others...or you can take the same life away from yourself and others.

0/0	You know how they work? By not taking them
0/0	You know how you know the vaccine is bullshit? They have to push propaganda in your face 24/7 to try to get you to take it.
0/0	You know how you're not supposed to buy the first iteration of an iphone or a playstation, or download the 1.0 version of a software and just wait it out till they fix the kinks with the update? Yeah...
1/1	You know it's faster because by now our modern technologies and Experts really help when it comes to this. Back then it was longer because we don't have high tech stuff. But anyways experts will try their best to help others, I believe that
1/0	You know it‚Äôs the end of the world when they force you to take the vaccine
0/1	You know something? If you don't take the 'vaccine', if you maintain a healthy immune system, take responsibility for your health and fitness, and all the rest of it...... One day you're going to wake up dead. Gets us all in the end.
1/1	You know that even if this death was related to the vaccine, FAR more people have died from COVID than the vaccine?? Like, its not even comparable. And therefore much better for your health and the health of others to get vaccinated
0/0	You know that it could take years to see if it's safe?
0/0	You know that it could take years to see if the vaccine is safe?

0/0/0/0	You know where you can stick your vaccine, don't you. It won't be in MY arm!
1/1	You lord Jesus, gave humans the knowledge to develop vaccines to save people's lives. Science isn't anti religion, so it makes no sense that people who are religious are so anti science..
0/0	You made a huge mistake. You just altered you dna.if it dont effect you it will effect your children...if you will be able to have any.
0/0	You may also get cancer or die in a year or two of a violent reaction to something that used to be harmless to you (some scientists have suggested this). Who knows? Also, we will NOT be free to do whatever we want regarding the vaccine, as you will soon see.
1/1	You may have missed a lot of good news about another vaccine today ‚úì No CVST or thrombotic events, > 64.5 million doses ‚úì 95% protection vs severe infections in extended 6 mo f/u of 900 cases in main trial ‚úì Progress for vaccine vs B.1. 351, and kids https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-clinical-and-supply-updates-covid-19-vaccine
1/1	You may not die from covid but someone else could therefore you need to take the vaccin, to protect others!
0/0	You mean sticking a vile of the coronavirus directly into your bloodstream isn't helping.... Shocker üò®
1/0	You mean to say vaccines work?! But what about Bill Gates and tracking you?! I was sure they had a strong argument he was up to something!
0/0/0	You mean, who will take the vaccine. No thx, I‚Äôll take a pass on that one.
1/1	You might as well buy your coffin off of Amazon. Just get your vaccines, will ya?
1/1	You might die without the vaccine shot, but it‚Äôs your call
1/1	You might have serious long term side effects. But you might have serious long term side effects from all of them. It is impossible to know this as none of the vaccines have been around long term. Perhaps Pfizer and Moderna will cause deadly cancer in all recipients in 10 years time, and it wont happen to anyone with other vaccines. Extremely unlikely but who knows? Nobody. What we do know is COVID-19 is deadly and kills or seriously debilitates people, even younger people at times. And as we have already seen cases of COVID "longhaulers," there are likely many awful long-term issues with COVID that we will find out about in the future as well. I think it is wise to side with the vaccines, as from what we know, unvaccinated people who contract the virus tend to be the ones dying.
0/0	You might see claims that the COVID-19 vaccine can make someone infertile or impotent, harm a developing fetus in the womb, make the immune system attack the placenta, or hurt a baby who is breastfeeding from a recently vaccinated mother.
1/1	You most likely were already vaccinated as a baby but if you are dumb enough to not vaccinate a child and you want to return to times where 1 out of 3 kids die before reaching the teenage years then there is something wrong with the way you are thinking. Please look up all the studies proving vaccinations are safe and you will realize all these anti vaxxers are complete and total morons without one ounce of common sense
0/0/0	You must be a brainless sheep to take a vaccine for a flu virus with over 99.5% survival rate
0/0	You must be so proud of your vaccine procurement... disgusting
0/0	You must state things as they really are. This is NOT a vaccine, it is an experimental drug, untested, unproven over time.It does not meet the medical definition of a 'vaccine'.
1	You need to help Brazil! COVID is ravaging the country, you need to get vaccines to them!
1/1	You need to inject and youre ready to effect and wait the results if its injected vacc√≠ne is effect√≠v√© to you. Pray faith and believe. God blessed us.

0/0	You people have no idea what goes on. Covid does not have any affects on the brain. The false info the media pushes is just insane. The SARS virus has been around for years and years. Shove the vaccine. Poison
0/0	You people realize these vaccines are not even FDA approved yet, and you want to force people to take them anyway? No long term studies, many people are having some awful side affects, and you can‚Äôt wait to give these to children babies and others who are low risk, because you don‚Äôt want to lower your chances of hospitalization by working on your own preventable diseases.
0/0	You prepare yourselves to change the DNA you the sons of devil we don't like such kind of vaccination in our pipeline
0/0	You raced making flu shots more than 70 yrs ago, and you made. But what happened since then? Did flu disappear? Oh yes, it did. It got a new name: Covid19.
1/1	You really can't fix stupid. They're just going to hurt themselves and sadly people with weakened immune systems. If they could be tried for murder, I'd wager they'd get it pretty quick.
0/0	You really have blind faith in a system that you don‚Äôt even understand how it works. You have some seriously misconstrued ideas. And you are not nearly as safe as you think you are.
0/-1	You really love this idea... it's getting hit about every day now‚Ä¶ Soon we'll all be showing our papers to the nice men with the guns.
1/1	You refuse vaccine, when you get Covid, you do not have any care in a hospital as you have put many other people at risk.
0/0	You remember D.A.R.E in school and they taught us about peer pressure and drugs. I was peer pressured to get the vaccine more In the last two weeks than I was for any illegal drugs in my entire life.
0/0	You see all the Photo's of Biden & Others high up getting their Covid Shot I don't buy it for a minute it's all for a photo shoot fake I'm sure it's a B-12 Shot or other. They think if you see them getting their shot you will run out and get yours How Stupid do they think most are? They are hoping all the Sheep will line up for the Slaughter in droves.
1	You shold thank the pharma companies they will save us with these vaccines
1/1	You should be allowed to print someones tweet about how vaccines are bad and race them to the doctor and steal their vaccine when the time comes. If they come back with a printout of you saying sketchy stuff in 2011 it blocks it though
1/1	You should be glad for vaccines. Imagine smallpox came back?
0/0	You should drink a glass of water rather than taking this vaccine.
0/0	You should have never Injected the chinese Plauge into your veins.... whenever you hear the word CHINESE with a product, The very second thought is FAKE PRODUCT.....
1/1	You should still get the COVID-19 vaccine even if you‚Äôve had a previous infection. The vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response.
0/-1	You shouldn't dismiss those people that are wary of a new vaccine as nut jobs. The swine flu vaccine had a 1/70 000 odds of giving people narcolepsy, something that was not known until long after. 1 year of testing is not enough time to accurately gauge these long-term risks. Narcolepsy is life-altering, you can't live a normal life after. If the Covid vaccine has the same odds, I for sure won't take it. I think many people here in Sweden will not since the narcolepsy issues became so news worthy here. If I were in a risk group, then probably but as a young person, it is not so obvious.
0/0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious?
1/1	You the man I got both shots no side effects but this keeps me assured. Thank you so much!
0	You think the big pharma make vaccine out of kindness? No it is to make money! Wake up!
0/0	You trusted Johnson + Johnson baby powder/ They knew it had asbestos. You gonna trust this?
1/1	You turn up and what is in stock is what you are getting. I got the Pfizer vaccine and had zero side effects. Love it!
0/-1	You two youngsters have certainly drank the kool-aid. Do you do ANY research yourself or do you just believe what you are told? Never mind, i know the answer to that question. Sure hope no one listens to you, but unfortunately, i know some will.
0/-1	You wanna see ‚ÄúMind Control‚Äù? Tell your parents you are not vaccinating your child... And SEE...
1/1	You want a normal life again? Then take the vaccine!
0/-1	You want to know the cure? Stop watching the media.
0/0	You want to know why it's rollout has been so bad? It's hard to get the nasty stuff they put in the vaccine, that's why. They have to wait for the chinese to send it over.
1/1	You were very brave once again. It looks like maybe a vaccine for covid will be required every year because it keeps mutating. Probably a small price to pay as long as it keeps everyone safe. Thank you for your valuable information and for putting yourself out there everyday. Stay safe until your vaccine kicks in. Impressive drumming by the way.

0/0	You would have to be an idiot to let them inject you with something they rushed together.
0/0	You would have to be mad if you're young fit and healthy to get the vaccine. Ill take my chances with a runny nose and a light cough.
0/0/0/0	You'd have to be a damn fool to get that fast-tracked vaccine.
0/0	You'd have to be nuts to get that shot, absolutely loco. Whenever authorities are pushing something, that's a red flag there's a hidden agenda, especially when it's global which merely serves as the legit angle for the false flag operation.
1/0	You're a doctor, you have to give the good example
1/1	You're always this patriotic. So now be it again and take the vaccine asap
0/0	You're an absolute fool if you take any of these vaccines.
0/0	You're basically rolling a dice with your health at stake.
0/0	You're concerned about getting #COVID but you're not at all concerned about being injected with it? That makes sense.
0/0	You're cute too. Funny how you think the pharma. industry doesn't make money off of forcibly required vaccines for old childhood illnesses 99.9% of kids got at school and didn't die, or go deaf, called the measles ect. People will be just as freaked out about chicken pox in ten years. I used to work for the CDC, I know the politics that comes out of there, and none of these shots are necessary. Basically, you are defending the idea of forcing a parent to play russian roulette with a vaccine, that I'm sorry to inform you, does cause autism, and other nasty things, so that your kid won't get something akin to the damn chicken pox. The CDC has been busted lying already, and the people who have come out against them, I am confident, one day, will be vindicated. You are the one that has bought into the scare tactics. If you think there aren't also plans to make money treating the effects of these vaccines, think again. Children also develop life long immunity when they are allowed to get these illnesses, and they are not going to die. You will not have life long immunity with a vaccine, no matter what they tell you. Go ahead and get yourself tested. See if you are still immune to all the crap they 'vaccinated' you for as a child. I will bet money that you aren't immune. They will tell you 'some adults' need a second or third shot... because the truth is we all do, and the truth is, the majority of people will never know they are not immune. Also, good luck finding the group of unvaccinated Orthodox Jews and Amish people that came down with the measles, in the last few years just so CDC could have a few American cases. They don't exist, and these are people who would otherwise have no idea the government is blaming them for disease outbreaks. I believe the Nazis did the same thing.
0/0	You're not alone Jack.There are millions of us not taking this farce.Sit tight and hang in to your intuition.It is your greatest protection.
1/1	You're not someone whoever got infected with covid19 virus or its life threatening complications. Antivaxxers are the dumbest people you will ever meet.
0/0	You're not supposed to take it while pregnant or breastfeeding. What an overwhelmingly huge bummer, I guess I have no choice but to wait the next 15 years before I take it. Maybe we'll actually have data on long-term side effects by then...
0/0	You're not vaccinating populations, you're vaccinating individuals. Individuals with free will don't want to take a vaccine that can kill them.
1/1	You're phase 1 because your work helps more than just yourself. Keeping you healthy increases your ability to treat the rest of us that can't get the vaccine yet.
0/0/0/0/0	You're presenting theories as facts. mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you.
1/1	YouTube could do a hell of a lot more to combat misinformation spread by anti-vax conspiratorial videos.
0/0	Youd be a DAMN FOOL to take this vaccine
1	Young and healthy people can get very sick, too
0/0	Young healthy people have died. AFTER "vaccination"
0/0	Young healthy people have died. AFTER "vaccination".
0/0	Young people are the real target of this poison.
0/0	Young women have virtually zero chance of dying from covid if they are healthy! Why are they taking it?
0/0/0	Young women who plan to have children someday shouldn‚Äôt take this vaccine yet. It hasn‚Äôt been tested long enough.
1/1	Younger people need to come out of their overconfidence of stronger immune system and get vaccinated to save themselves as well as stop spreading the virus to the more vulnerable people.
0/1	Your "advice" is .... "dont listen to any negative things about it, everyone has to have it" ... cool that seems like an unbiased, responsible response
1/0	Your Covid19 vaccine is excellent. In a family of 5 where one of the member got both doses and was exposed to the virus 25 days after getting the 2nd dose. All the family tested positive except for the vaccinated member.
0/0	Your Not Vaccinating Me! I AM NOT Taking Any Covid-19 Vaccines! There Is No Covid-19 Pandemic This Is a Plandemic! Your vaccinations are In line with depopulation
1/1	Your boy just got his second vaccine shot. I‚Äôm two weeks away from going to a Yankees game and being totally confused about what is safe to do or not to do as a fully Covid vaccinated human.
1/-1	Your chances of getting blood clots in general is 2 per 1,000. So less than 1 out of 1,000,000 potential from the J&J vaccine and there is a pause? So much for science, math and common sense. Someone must have a stake in Pfizer big time.Trump is right.Pure politics
1/1	Your decision about whether or not to get vaccinated is not just about yourself ... This is a 'love your neighbor' moment. https://t.co/koWOkF6BaS
0/0	Your doctor recommend you get a second shot? Common sense would tell you definitely NOT
1/-1	Your family and coworkers need you
0/0	Your father is now a genetically modified organism. You can be very proud.
1/1	Your gal is joining the workforce as a HCSW - Vaccinator in the fight against COVID-19
1/1	Your healthy immune system is not going to protect you from covid19 because it has never come across that particular pathogen before and it is therefore not primed to eliminate it.
1/1	Your idiotic anti-vax crap is ignorant and insane.
0/-1	Your immune system can now protect you from Covid
0/0	Your immune system is the best way to protect yourself!!!
0/0	Your immune system works BEST

0/0	Your natural antibodies are more important than an artificial substance.
0/0	Your natural immune system is stronger than any vaccine
0/0	Your not going to tell me that out of 6 million shots one person a had a fatality and there're pulling the drug. There is more here they are not telling us.
0/0	Your priority should be concentrated on providing sufficient food and healthy water for poor countries before marketing the vaccines.
0/0	Your propaganda is disgusting. We don't get healthy by filling our bodies with toxins. Likewise, we don't get sick from an absence of pharmaceuticals.
0/-1	Your right their both a pair of sanctimonious hypocrites But maybe they both realise that the whole thing is a load of mass hysteria and like almost 100% of people in the country they have nothing to be worried about so were just getting on with their lives
1/0	Your safer getting the flu vaccine because it gives a small immune boost and it‚Äôs been around longer sorry not sorry . Covid vaccine can wait
1	Your strong immune system also needs to be "tuned" to recognize the virus. Otherwise it takes too long to respond to the new threat.
0/0	You‚Äôll never force me to get anything I don‚Äôt deem safe into my body. Just like the flu shot which contains a small amount of mercury which can‚Äôt be taken out of your body ever. No thanks give the Jab to someone else who wants it!
0/0	You‚Äôre gonna trust a vaccine that was made in a year or less even though it takes years of research that‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt find the cure of other diseases huh. bill gates helping with the vaccine even tho he‚Äôs been very open about population control. Interesting.
0/0	You‚Äôre immune system is still more effective than the covid vaccine

0/0	Yup let‚Äôs just genetically modify our cells and just hope it goes well
1/1	Yup, having those flu like symptoms right now. If this is how my body reacts to the shot, I can't imagine how terrifying and painful contracting actual covid would be. So glad I'll be all protected by moving day.

1/1	along with the infection rates, the anti vaxx sentiment has also spiked. i blame general distrust in the governments and the lack of education around this new type of vaccine, especially in the older generations who might not have access to educational resources / not speak english
0/0	already had covid wasnt even bad no thanks.
0/0	also you fear mongering shills always talk about the long term effect of COVID. of which none are proven so far. but completely ignore the potential long term effects of an experimental vaccine. For example. the very likely effect on fertility. as this is mostly likely being used for population control.

0/0	but the thing is, mRNA vaccine modifies our body in the DNA level, and this is kind of vaccine that the scientist never used before, so we don't really know the side effects in the future

1/1	congrats!! I can't wait til I can receive mine. It makes sense that younger people would experience more symptoms since their immune system is better, so theirs is on high alert, the older you get it just seems like it takes more to aggravate it... perhaps the immune system is just like someone who has seen a lot of hardship in their lives, they don't react as angrily to an incident.

0/0	first of all... the numbers have already been proven boosted... the flu randomly disappeared... along with all the deaths from heart disease lung disease etc... what happened ?! Did masks help people with bad hearts ?? Nah I don‚Äôt think so... what was the number or people that died strictly from covid ?? Not many... most had underlying issues and a lot were already on the way out... no I‚Äôm not insensitive either... I‚Äôm a realest and that‚Äôs just how life is... so now tell me why... if I‚Äôm healthy with no underlying conditions am I going to line up for a vaccination filled with shit u have no idea of short term or long term problems for a virus that IF I contract it I have a 99%+ chance to survive ??
0/0	flu vaccine took over a decade to bring to public, ask the experts if they will have the jab first and we can take it from there, that's not fake new on vaccines, I've had flu jab today. If the world has naturally produced a virus that has stopped the world (flu never stopped the world) how can a vaccine be found in the blink of eye ... nothing makes sense except we get the news we want to hear
0/0	flu vaccine, 100 years, still 40% effective and people die after getting it sometimes because it weakens their immune system. Vaccines are moronic if u take it EVERY YEAR.
0/0	flu vaccines don't work. this won't work as well.
1/1	for a year now I have had this sign hanging from my balcony. And a year later we do have hope in the vaccines! Covid is not over yet, but we are getting closer.
1/1	for all those that donet want to get the vaccines, bring them to us that we want..!! Haha more for us then!..
1	for me the only reason i got the vaccine is becuase i work directly with paients. Even i never got sick and never have the flu or anything. But i want to protect my mom and others elderly from it. I always mask up and stay 6 ft. but i still go out
0/0	for proof that vaccination is both useless and dangerous, read the folloiwng medical evidene from the most eminent physicians on europe.
1/0	for those who chose not to take it, that's fine, natural selection at this point. But I know y'all were also the ones complaining about no vaccine

0/0/0	gates is evil hes not even a doctor, has been sued billions by the indian and african respective goverments for his horrendous vaccines that caused polio and birth defects in over 600.000 indian children, and thr fatalities of 10 thousand African children under the age of 2 for a malaria jab. This may be censored info but it is accessible to anybody who has the ability to turn on there computer and use a non propaganda flitered search engine (duckduckgo. com for one) if you still either use google or only tune into bbc/sky news then not only are you ignorant, but you info from one source despite philosophers for generations that have preached about looking apon any given problem from different outlooks will grant you a better outlook - only citing one source becos it's "official" when every government in existence has been corrupt at 1 point or another, is not only ignorant, but shows u have an uneasy trust in strangerd. The better question to ask would be how do you undoubtedly trust a goverment that would keep open mcdonalds and shut gyms during a time when people will be at therr laziest and most mentally unstable? When there is a virus that will affect you the more unhealthy you are. Idc bout 0.0001 perfectly mortality rate ill take my chances as im sure 90% of the population would ‚úå

0/0	getting vaccinated when you're a healthy adult is retarded. there is no such thing as "long covid", that's simply depression and anxiety from being one of The Afflicted
1/1	gettting a thrombosis from this vaccine is less likely than you choking and dying on your own spit while reading this comment. AstraZeneca was paused for similar reasons and is resumed because the risk is so low. Same thing will happen with J&J.

0/1	hat‚Äôs fair enough, but then if there is a vacine that a lot of countries are ruling out completely and Ireland has at present ruled it out for about 90% of its people, what makes it safe for around 10%. Or do that 10% matter, they have nothing to give anymore. https://t.co/W6TcQ8Tjxx

1/1/1	he COVID-19 vaccine will protect you and others from the virus and help us end this pandemic.
1/1	he vaccine' survival rate is much higher than 99% -> so if you get the vaccine you have a 100% survivral rate to the Covid19 since you won't develop the severe forms of the disease.

TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING AFTER TAKING IT SO I DO NOT CARE HOW FAST THEY MADE IT
0/0	i am sure the government kool-aid crowd will justify this death.... but it is a wakeup call for what they DONT know about this rushed vaccine. Maybe the cure is worse than the disease in some cases!
0/0/0/0	i am very skeptical of it. i‚Äôm sorry i won‚Äôt get the vaccine. thats just my opinion

0/0	i had a severe vaccine injury with pandremix which was rushed out for swine flu, took me a year to recover. So am extremely worried about another vaccine
1/1	i had it a week ago no side effects
1/1	i had my doubts too, and i just saw the vaccine as less of a threat than being sick over and over and having to not work. i've read the research, it's promising.
1/1	i had the oxford astra zenaca vaccine on March 20th.i feel ok after it.why are they saying it causes blood clots.i got to have a second dose on june.And am over 60
1	i had the vaccine on Tuesday. Im fine

0/0/-1	i just watched a video that said people can turn into a reptile after taking the vaccine
1/1/1/1	i know a woman who is 95 and had both MODERNA vaccines already ,she is doing fine afterwards
1/1	i know moderna costs more, but it seems like, moderna is the better one for older populations
1/1	i know several vaccinated persons, including myself. between moderna and pfizer the only side effect in any of the cases i've seen is a sore arm lasting no longer than 2 days. all this population control conspiracy crap makes no sense. if the shots are that deadly, why would all the richest and most important people get it first? why would every government in the whole world agree to cripple their economies unless there was a good reason? how would the reduced productivity and increased unemployment of lock down be good for rich people or governments? do you honestly think if the who started telling you how to eat and exercise instead of wearing a mask and washing you hands that you'd listen?

0/0	i'll trust the government with my health when they stop selling cigarettes.
1/1	i'm 100% pro vaccination (as any sane person should be), but this is a tiny bit scary. It's possible that i might be one of those rare cases who gets blood clots from it - deep vein thrombosis runs in my family - my mum nearly died from a blood clot in her 20s, that started in her legs, but doctors managed to fix it before it got to her heart. I'll still get the shot, since it's the whole world's safety at risk, not just my own, and even with a hereditary condition the risk is still tiny, but i am a lil nervous. It's reassuring to see in the article that doctors are urging people to stay for 15 minutes after the shot

Luckily, it looks like they've collected enough data to be able to identify at-risk people, and take appropriate precautions. Overall, seems like taking it is still way less risky than not taking it!

1/1	if ur an anti-vax,then i feel sorry for u and your children,btw i'm waiting the vaccines in home,is the best that we can do know.
1/1	if ur the only who gets the vaccine, then the pandemic is not going to end soon, people are still going to die. That's why, everyone or least 50% of the world probably needs to take it to curb and possibly end the pandemic.
1/1	if vaccines didn‚Äôt work, then why has the polio and measle rate decrease.

1/0	imagine thinking the vaccine is bad
0/0	immune system will take care of it.
0/-1	impossible to imagine that the people still willfully in a comatose state after a year of this insanity... will ever wake
0/0	in 5 years it will also be known to be very dangerous as well
1	in conclusion: dont be and ativax-er karen
1/1	in my country vaccination is mandatory and free, it has nothing to do with earning money.
0/0	in my country. we are doing much better,. no need of the vaccine
0/0	in other words they don't want anyone reported their side effects.. just go ahead and believe it is normal ,, hope your family are ready for you to go..
0/0	in other words, they have no clue of what the side effects will be..
1/1	in short, YES GET VACCINATED, PLEASE
1/1	in the past vaccines have gave people certain reactions and even death in some cases . This is good news that these vaccines are going without a hitch .
1/1	inactivated vaccines are good options.
1/1	individuals protecting themselves protects the herd in the long run, when enough are protected the virus has no where to go.
0/0	injury and deaths are off the scale with these experimental pointless injections and that is only in the short term
1/1	insane that people would rather have the entire virus genome inside of them than a fragment of it from the vaccine
0/0	interesting experiment for Mrna..... Edits the genetics. Next step genetic diseases.
0/0	is there any liability for the vaccine makers if something goes wrong? If not, who benefits from selling us this vaccine and why?
0/0	is this even a vaccine ? MRNA ???? a vaccine has to be tested for atleast 5 to 10 yeasr before it can be administered to the masses to see the long term side effects. people are getting terminally sick and even dying from this mrna test. we humans are the Guinea pigs and we cant even take action or sue these vaccine makers for damages. yet still we are taking this experimental shittt..... we are surely brainwashed and we aren't thinking for ourselves. wake up people . we have hydroxy-chloroquin + zinc and even ivermectine which are cures yet still a vaccine agenda is being pushed. my god help us....
0/0	isn't it interesting how pro-vaccine people will take credit for millions of lives being saved by vaccines... but they will never take any responsibility for even one single death caused by vaccine?
0/0	it doesn‚Äôt give you immunity stop calling it a vaccine
1/1	it helps to get back to normal life
1/1	it is better than dying
1/1	it is better to take this vaccine
1/1	it is embarrassing how these anti-vaxxers put in danger their own child and the weakest, most in-need children who are not healthy enough to be vaccinated (herd-immunity) just for one fucking paper showing a CORRELATION, not a causation. i.e. pure speculation.
0/0	it is funny we live in a free world but we are forced to take a western medicine even if we are not sick or we don't need
1/1	it is great to finally have the vaccines ready for the people
1/1	it is safe for diabetic people. My mother diabetic and she got her first shot about 4 weeks ago. She didn't had any side effects.
1/1	it is the greatest invention of all time
1/1	it is the only way to prevent coronavirus from entering your body
1/1	it is theONLY solution and we can only hope it works..
1/1	it is. the search for a covid-19 vaccine is one of the most well-researched and most well-funded, cooperative scientific endeavours of the modern era. even though we've been so divided this year, somehow humanity still found it in us to work together to find a cure for this awful disease that has killed hundreds of thousands in the us alone
0/0	it poison . end of story.
0/0	it takes at most 10 days to recover from the vaccine?? You kidding me? Without vaccines it takes 10 days to recover.
1/1	it was my turn today to get inoculated against covid. got my first shot today. thank you
0/0	it will be interesting to see what the effects on these Guinea pigs will be!
0/0	it won't help us to not get it again, it will mean we will still have to wear the masks, and how come pep[;e ar gettomg bad things from it, and how come they have not had trials for it only a couple of hundred people and then it was people, not rats or guinea pigs and how come if this doesn't help us stop wearing the mask and it doesn't help us from not getting it again, how come they won't let us us Harliqoquin or other medicines that have been around for a long time that cure it if you catch it early? You people are just asking for trouble, you have to do your homework and check different things to make sure. I won't take it until I am sure what ever they have it has been tested. Also I believe we never had to do all this nonsense in the first place it just fit in perfectly for a pandemic that didn't need to be. They wanted people to listen to them and for us to be under their control so they could do what they are doing, ruining our wonderful country. The whole thing was just made up to keep us under control.
1/1	it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine
1/1	it's been 3 weeks getting second dose tomorrow. Please...do your part!!
0/1/1	it's criminal that this vaccine is not being widely rolled out in europe, but saying that the AZ vaccine has already saved millions of lives is a little bit hyperbolic..
0/0	it's designed to change our DNA unlike the common (safe) vaccines, they introduce a piece of the dead virus to help out body detect the virus
1/1	it's interesting how the educated ones are the people who support the vaccine
1/1	it's just the mRNA of the virus and that is an established practice already so it can be assumed to be decently safe
1/1	it's not like they have just started working on the vaccine from step 1, it has been studided before
0/0	it's safe and fully tested...right? oh hell NO! the covid vaccines are EXPERIMENTAL! remember that!
1/1	it's still safer to get vaccinated than to get covid
1/1	it's to prevent hospitalization and death, which all vaccines did at 100% efficiency.
0/0	its a lie COVID 19 VACCINATION IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST 666 THE TIME HAS COME !
0/0	its a persons right to refuse something they dont want in their body
0/0	its bad when they have to CONVINCE you that it is safe to take and you should do it
0/0	its dangerous. im an indian from europe and we got lot of problems here with the vaccine. hope not a lot of my fellow brothers and sisters will take this shot. please be careful.
0/0	its fake news!! Covid and vaccise is hoax
1/1	its funny how sceintis want to help people and yet people resist!
0/0	its makes your immune system weaker that‚Äôs the price you pay take vitamin A, D, C that‚Äôs all you need
0/0/0	its never been a "vaccine", it's genetic engineering.
0/0	its not safe, obviously lol, Don‚Äôt get it it may well be the mark of the beast
1/1	its over 90 % safe just take it already!!
0/0	its reasonable to know that over 99 percent of people recover from covid.the vaccinations can't compete with those percentages.these shill doctor's need to go back and study mathematics.scientist information are a bunch of tested theories that are ever-changing.nothing in this life is guaranteed,but at least let us choose for ourselves what is best.the government is a beast entity that only cares about itself.
1/1	its sad to see how hard the scientists are working on the vaccine and how negative people are
0/0	its survival of the fittest, gtfo vaccines making men weak
1/1	its time to start killing antivaxxers and using them as compost. Things like them dont deserve to live.
1/1/1	it‚Äôs not all about you. If you contract COVID-19 and you are in contact with someone who has a weakened immune system then spread it to them. That means you are responsible for their severe illness/death since you had the power to protect yourself and in turn them. Just because someone has asthma does that mean they deserve to die?
1/1	it‚Äôs not just about you though. The first vaccine is to make your body ready for the booster which is a larger dose. The booster won‚Äôt have any effect In you because of the original. The side effects aren‚Äôt actually side effects. They are just your immune system building resistance against the virus.
1/1	it‚Äôs understandable to be worried about it, i think lot‚Äôs of people are iffy about it who normally wouldn‚Äôt be just because of the sheer speed of it. But I really think it might help alleviate your worries if you read about the how‚Äôs and why‚Äôs of the speed of this vaccine. ‚ò∫Ô∏è and you‚Äôll see that they had quite the headstart anyway, they just needed the investment of the government to ramp up production, etc. The other thing that has helped, is the coverage of this virus, because it has resulted in a LOT of people taking part in the vaccine safety trials where they normally don‚Äôt have such numbers. I hope that helps a little! ü•∞
1/1	ive been wanting a vaccine but cant get one cuz of priority queue
1/1	i‚Äôm getting my first dose tonight!!!
0/0/0	i‚Äôm not scared about an allergic reaction i‚Äôm scared about the long term effects because we don‚Äôt know what they are
0/0/0/0	i‚Äôm not taking anything that changes my DNA smd
1/1	i‚Äôm pro vaccine all the way but if the conspiracy theorists are right and it turns out to kill us out or something, i‚Äôll be glad to be gone because then the only things left on this planet are those insufferable cunts
1/1	i‚Äôm pro vaccine, i‚Äôm pro (single) mask, and i still follow the guidelines/laws in the state i live in i dont go to ppls houses or to parties smh
1/1	i‚Äôs weird, vaccines have done their job so well that there are people who are likely alive from them denouncing them
1/1	just got my covid vaccine- astounded at the process, grateful for this moment.
1/1	just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1/1/1/1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe
1/1/1/1	just got vaccinated. feeling good
0/0	just poison
1/-1	just stick me please and thank you!
0/0	just wait to get covid19 if you are in good health. seriously. the vaccine is for people with bad health, are old, or haven't had covid 19.
1/1	karen it isnt the vaccine's fault your kid is autistic, have you considered getting yourself checked?
1/0	karens: im not vacinating my kids ever everyone:didnt you drop out of second grade good for you now your kids will die if you tried
1/1/1	keep the good work UK. well done! My second Pfizer will happen the next thursday (4 days and counting). I am in NYC and I literally can't wait :)
0/0	keep them for your self
0/0	keep your placebo vaccine. jam it in your own arms
1/1	know I‚Äôm late on this, but Jesus Christ! A lot of fucking people are actually not going to take the vaccine. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE!?!?
1/1	l take the vacine and there is no pain no side effects ..is just fine...l go for the second in 25 days ...
1/1	lady: it killed my aunt, my uncle, my friends bUt iM nOt aFrAiD oF iT
0/0	last time they released one of these it took years and years to get licensed and approved but they jus hit us with this in a year.
1/1	laughs in vaccinated British accent
0/1	let them get vaccinated. it is not your body. I understand the vaccine concerns but no-one decides for another person. I am anti vaccine btw
1/1	let's go vaccines!
1/1	let's hope that these vaccines become available sooner than later. We really need to get this viral epidemic under control as quickly as possible‚Ä¶
0/0	let's see what a couple of months/years to see the real effects,good luck
1/1	let`s take this vaccine and see what happens.
1/1	lets hope they will work and we can all continue our lives!!
1/1	letting the virus spread is the better idea? take the damn vaccine
0/0	liars, people are waking up
0/0/0	liberals - "it's my body , don't tell me what to do", liberals over vaccine -" everyone needs to be forced to take the vaccine".
1/1	like the humor but 66% is still generally effective once applied to the population, I think fear of vaccine rn is more than ever and stuff like this makes it harder to convince those who just see the headline and assume to actually get it. if anything any vaccine even 25% is useful or less because it removes a portion of the population from getting covid. you remove 25% of the US pop its 82m people immune :). understand most people know that it isnt an issue, but given recent events and the last few years, stats dont really mean much to most, they see a low number and use it as a weapon against whatever agenda. we should be heralding the effectiveness of any vaccine given the short period, especially one that can be transported to rural areas easier where the population more likely to be sceptical of it lives.
1/1	listen I don't know about all this american spiritual trippy stuff, but what I know is that if not enough people take the vaccine, then people will die. Alot of people will die. And for what? This is what happens when people forget history, forget diseases like polio and what it does to people. "But the vaccine might give side effects" yes? How many can be saved with it? Hundreds? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? People need to care about others than themselves.
1/1	literally no poison or anything harmful in a vaccine. Russian roulette is what you play with covid, not the vaccine.
1/1	little scared but will still get the vaccine for the greater good save the old ones
0	load bs all to depopulate the human race,they are gene therapys if you have had the test up the nose you have already have the nanos in you
1/1	lol planning on getting the vaccine
0/0	lol still dont plan on taking the vaccine.
0/0	lol yeah lets change the DNA of all Humans, that can't possibly go wrong XD
0/0	lol you think this poison protects you?
0	lol. They tell you their evil ways. I am glad that some actually pay attention. There is no 'covid'. It is just a normal flu season. But by using different words they carry out their evil plans. And they are tormenting and attacking all of us because that is what evil people do. Evil people love the power of government.
1/1	lolwhut? why are you suggesting people will get covid19 from the vaccine? the vaccine doesn't cause the disease. not only that, but trials so far have shown 94% of those vaccinated are immune to the disease, and 0% of those vaccinated get severe symptoms if they are one of the 6% who aren't immune. do you understand?
1/1	long term effects haha. Any serious vaccine side effects show up in the first two or three weeks after vaccination. The blood clotting, if it is a result of the vaccine, this is not yet determined, the cases could be a statistical fluke. Even if it is an adverse reaction to the vaccine the numbers are virtually insignificant, to the extent that we wouldn't be able to observe them in a clinical trial. Such extremely rare events are only ever discovered in our after market monitoring of the product. The after market monitoring also highlights when changing the dosing schedule would be beneficial. This was seen with the
1/-1	look at all the trolls disliking because they can't accept reality lol
0/0	looks like i will not be traveling if you need a vaccine to travel. TYRANY
0/0	lots of people died after contracting vaccine
1/1	love how everyone suddenly comes a professional in work that people have taken years to train for ü•¥ simple if you don't want the vaccine dont have it but also don't put others off from having it iv had mine am still here living and breathing and no side effects what so ever üëå
1/1	m guessing you aint currently age or health prone and don‚Äôt believe in Covids cos you never seen one leering menacingly through your window. Culture enough and you are sure to get a convincing little blighter a real beano no amount of vaccine tweaking will fix. All for the sake of one quick shot. It won‚Äôt hurt you! Not painful ! Honestly!
1/1	mRNA COVID vaccines are safe and effective. mRNA vaccines don't affect your personal genes or DNA. They do not contain a live virus. They cannot give you COVID
0/0	mRNA VACCINES ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN CORONAVIRUS COVID-19
0/0	mRNA and DNA-based vaccines' side-effects in the short (6 months - 1 year), medium (2 to 3 years) and long (5+ years) term ARE COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO SCIENCE. Thus those who consciously and voluntarily agreed to participate in such clinical trials and got those vaccines in their system have become lab rats indeed.
1/1	mRNA can't mutate because it's just messenger RNA. The reason why we have mutations is due to mistakes in the DNA duplication process when cells divide. Which is unrelated to the mRNA vaccine.
1/1	mRNA does not alter your genetics and this method of developing vaccines has been studied for over a decade now.
1/1	mRNA does not change your genes.
0/0	mRNA gene therapy taches our bodies to attack the 'protein S' which is already in our bodies, and is vital in the process of the reproduction. Wasn't it BG who wanted to fight overpopulation?
1/-1	mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or üß¨ code.
1/1	mRNA is precursor of protein. It‚Äôs as safe as protein or even safer. I would take it
1/0	mRNA not a trusted vaccine, be cautious whoever taking.. I will take adenovirus vaccine, which we can trust. Adenovirus vaccines are very successful.
0/0	mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system.
0/0	mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you
0/0	mRNA treatements have only ever been used on last case worst case senarios! wake up. the studies in 2004 showed that the SARS vaccines killed 100% of the test subjects after the vaccinated were exposed to the wild virus strain. This go around YOU are the TEST SUBJECT.
1/1	mRNA vaccine seems less likely to cause issues. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt involve any live virus. Does not involve going into the nucleus itself at all. There is just less steps in the process in general.
0/1	mRNA vaccines actually induce an illness instead of an immuno-transmissive response. In other words, nothing about this is going to stop you transmitting anything. This is about getting you sick, and having your own cells be the thing that get you sick.
0/0	mRNA vaccines are dangerous according to most Doctors. You did also not test them for long term damages so I say no thank you to the vaccine.
1/1	mRNA vaccines are like putting a CD in your computer but not copying it to the hard drive
1/1/1/1/1	mRNA vaccines are such a genius method, I love it
0/0	mRNA vaccines are toxic, thats why they have to split it up in 2 doses
1/1	mRNA vaccines don't alter your DNA, they teach it to make a protein to combat the virus. Learn the truth by trusted sources like CDC, FDA, ACIP, WHO, as well as the makers of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, and J&J Janssen vaccine
0/0	mRNA vaccines have NEVER used before on such a wide scale. that is no conspiracy. and i will not be a test subject of big pharma. and who knows what genetic modifications this vaccine will do to my still unborn children? i do not know. i will wait for traditional Oxford or Russian Sputnik to be available. to take the new mRNA vaccine i would have to trust big pharma or EU regulators. which i don't.
1/-1	mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine
1/1/1	mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.

1/1	mRNA vaccines take advantage of this process by introducing the mRNA for an important protein from the virus that the vaccine is trying to protect against.
0/0/0/0	main side effect,...death!.

1/1	many vaccines to choose from
0/0	may have long-term effects
0/-1/-1	may have long-term side effects
0/0	maybe vaccines reduce fertility?
0/0	maybe you should call this 'EXPERIMENTAL vaccine hesitancy.' Because these are global......EXPERIMENTS?' Hahaha. Do you guys go over documented mRNA vaccine reactions? Peer reviewed and all that? That'd be great....thanks.

1/1	more anti vaxxers mean more vaccines for normal people
1/1	more antivacciners, more vaccines for me and my family!!
1/1	more people are in favor of a vaccine than not, the anti vax dummies are made up of 10-20% of Americans
1/1	more vaccine opponents succeed in preventing or at least delaying herd immunity ... the longer it will take for life to return to normal and that will further undermine faith in the government and its institutions
1/1	much thanks for the trust in the vaccine. we can all live the normal life... again.

1/1	my dad mom and brother along with me got the pfizer vaccine. We're all fine. My dad and mom had burning ears and a scratchy throat in the first day of being vaccinated, after that first day they felt perfect after. Me and my brother had no symptoms after vaccination and we all tested positive for antibodies against coronavirus as of yesterday. You're an anti-vax fool. Science doesn't lie so trust in science.

1/1	my wife and i had our second jab at melton mowbray very pleased with the way it was organised . friendly quick and efficient .
1/1	my younger sister had a kidney reaction to a baby vaccine, and as a result, she had to be hospitalized for a few weeks, and she will not be able to get that specific vaccine again, and others that may have the same outcome. however, my family and I are still on vaccines. if my sister cannot get this vaccine, she is at risk of having this disease, and to avoid this it is necessary that the people who have contact with her have the vaccine. Get vaccinated to protect yourself, and those who for health reasons cannot be vaccinated.
1/1	myself and loved ones will also get the vaccine!
0/1	n my opinion that shows improvement of medicine of nowadays. This vaccines are not that good but Chinese and other scientists are trying to make something good for people and that's really making me think,that someone is carrying about my health and making my life better

1/1	no,vaccines boost your immune system.
0/0	no. it can not. with the rate this is mutating, there is no way a vaccine is going to do anything. there are really only two ways to get a handle on this. Complete shut down, or go back to NORMAL and let it run its course. If everyone gets it, and beats strain a, it wont have as much of a chance to mutate before it can be destroyed by our immune systems. Deaths to date are STILL within normal yearly flu deaths. So choose. Hide from the bogyman that sees you in the corner, or pull up your big person pants and get too work. '
1/1	nobody wants this stupid bullshit just give us the vaccine
0	nobody will take the vaccine unless their stupidity reaches above the human limits
0/0	nobody with a brain cell in there head is going take that vaccine
0/0	none of them prevent transmission so quite a dangerous path to go down
1/0	nope not for me sorry not sorry like the saying goes my body my choice ill take my 98 percent chance or whatever it is at surviving it let my body build its own immunity you should not feel forced into doing this
1/1	not a huge fan of Biden either, but fortunately he won‚Äôt support a vaccine mandate. Medical freedom still exists and if you don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine, then don‚Äôt, but scientific evidence is still going to be there to support why you should consider getting it.
0/0	not a single person I know trust the vaccine or are willing to take it.
0/1	not every vaccine had side effects.. at least China's does not have according to them.... CHINA NO.1!!!!
0/0	not everyone wants the vaccine
0/0	not getting it because it's rushed
0/0	not getting it!! I had Covid I survived it...my rheumatologist suggested I still get the injection I‚Äôm not getting it
0/0	not gonna put unnatural chemicals in my body for a 99.99% survival rate of my age range.
0/-1	not one of them can be trusted to be honest... end of..
0/0	not safe enough for me to take.
0/0	not suitable for old people
0/0	not sure if the vaccine is effective enough
0/0	not taking any more vaccines....I no longer trust the manufacturers.
0/0	not taking it
0/0	not taking it. Also their passport is so bs
0/0	not the way it was tested, dangerous
0/0/0	nothing is safe from you or gates.
1/1	notice how the pro vax people are just so much more sophisticated
0/0	now EVIL bill gates pushing for the third dose.... i think once u take the vaccine ur body will depend on it so u will hv to take all the comin doses... ur immunity will drop down.... good luck to deal later with auto immune diseases !!! WAKE UP PPL ... EAT HEALTHY! u survive ...
0/0	now way to know if this shit is safe, not taking it
1/-1	nstead if creating an air of suspicion against any kind of vaccine and it's side effects, the health authorities should clearly outline what side effects to which age band, etc. Repercussions of not taking the vaccine far outweigh the side effects, if any.
0/0	nterview mothers who have had normal, healthy children who suddenly regress or cannot stop screaming in pain after they were vaccinated. I know a child damaged by vaccines. She could walk and talk but after a doctors visit she lost all her abilities to walk and speak. Find out how many families the government has compensated for the damage done by vaccines. If they weren‚Äôt harming people then why would they be compensated?
0/0	o the study said that in the trials there have been no side effects? How long were the trials? --A Week!?
1/1	oday I got the best news! My Dad is booked in for his #COVID19 vaccine this month. He's 67 yrs old with COPD and continues to work his butt off as a mechanic. I'm so happy
0/0	of cause they say it‚Äôs safe it‚Äôs all about the MONEY they have no responsibility for what they inject you with its 100% profit
1/1	of course ... we should take the vaccine and feel safe! who refuse to take it is our enemy. god bless bill gates, he is a really nice man
0/0	of course they dont want your killshot
1/1	of course!
1/0/1	of friggin course your sources are from 4chan, anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt have ANY credible sources
1/1	ofc i'm taking it!
1/1	often a single dose is enough to stimulate long-term protection
1/1	oh my god just put the antivaxxers into a room with a covid patient for a day and let them out to do whatever they want smh
0/0	ohhhh arent you special? getting poison injected into you but i guess it will weed out the stupid people
1/-1	ok so my question is this. So they arent actually using covid19 in the vaccines?
1/1	okay, this sounds safe
1/1	omg although I missed the early squad. I have been receiving so many requests from friends and family regarding the safety of covid vaccines. This video eases my burden of explaining and addresses all the doubts one might have.
0/0	once you get the poison, you can never go back.
0/0	one friend of mine died from covid even tho he was vaccinated with the 2 doses :(
0/0/0	one vaccine covid vaccine has been band in 4 countries for causing blood clots so I would not doubt there are other issues with them
0/0	one way to get rid of the poor people! astrazeneca comes to mind? look what B Gates did to the poor in India, another of his resets.
1/1	one would be lucky to even get an appt for the vaccine let alone having a choice in which one...
0/0	only a fool would take any of these vaccines..
0/0	only stupid people will agree to vaccine themselves like pigsüòÆ
0/0/0/0	only the dumbest sheeple will take this vaccine or any vaccine for that matter.
0/0	only took 8 months to make this vaccine and mers and ebola has been round for long time and they couldn't make a vaccine that works! Sorry not enough testing has done!
1/1	only way to get rid of this shit is to take vaccine
0/0	opting out, with a 99.98 survival rate if I get it, why would I put this experimental vaccine in by body.
1/-1	or safety, they already know what adverse events to look out for; inflammatory reactions, or antibody-dependent enhancement...those are real risks, but they are captured in the real world clinical trials.
0/0	other times cleaning personnel are completely ignored.And when it's about vaccination they are priority? How can people not know they are completely using people as test subject? If the vaccine was properly researched and safe all these politicians would have recieved vaccination before any one else.
1/1	our life might depend on it one day. No jab no job no foreign holidays etc is the way forward. None vaccine takers are relying on other people taking it to get our lives back to normal. Selfish especially when there's fk all wrong with the vaccines. If people did more research? they have been in the pipeline for years they simply add the virus code.
1/1	our whole household will be fully vaccinated.
1/-1	over the counter birth control has a higher chance of causing blood clots yet we aren't panicking it, why is that, Josh?
0/1/1	oxford/astrazeneca is your only option if you want a vaccine. And i wouldn't get it yet personally.
1/1	people CAN refuse it and should refuse it if they have concerns. im an RN in a covid ICU and i happen to have MS- for me, the risk of getting covid and having long term effects was greater than my concern about the vaccine. i had the vaccine last week and had no side effects other than an extremely sore arm for about a day. but i support people making decisions they are comfortable with.
1/1	people acting smarter than trained physicians lmaoo we are doomed as a species
1/0	people also survived a million years without eyeglasses. So what, you're not gonna wear em if you have bad eyesight?
1/1	people always insist to stand against science, they only appricate it after years
0/0	people are hesitant to blindly trust something with unproven long term complications when it‚Äôs their life on the line, people are allowed to be skeptical, you don‚Äôt have any high ground over them
1/1	people disliking this video are the reason so many people keep dying... selfish fing morons
1/-1	people do not die without a Formula One car, but not without a vaccine, do they?
1/1	people don't deserve science, all those anti vacciners shall not be allowed to take it
0/0	people dont need covid vaccine people need God REPENT ALL PEOPLE
0/1	people in 2020: be careful not to catch covid!! people in 2021: lets inject covid into our arms!!
1/1	people my age will mix uppers, downers, smoke weed, do coke and drink a 12 pack of beer in 4 hours, but QUESTION HOW SAFE THE VACCINE IS.
0/1	people on the antivaccine side tend to make bold claims but no evidence to back it up.
0/0	people shouldn't be taking vaccines for a virus that isn't dangerous.
1/1	people still dont understand that it doesnt take long to create vaccine now‚Ä¶ like in the old days when the flu first came out
1/1	people were willing to participate in clinical trials which was huge in getting things moving right on this vaccine!
0/0/0	people who are considered fit and healthy go in for this thing and wind up dead within hours or days, with the media saying there‚Äôs no correlation to the shot causing the death of the participant.
0/1	perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
0/0	pfizer got me sweatin
1/1	pfizer made it!
1	pfizer vaccine? biontech AND pfizer vaccine!
0/1	please continue with the testing and ensure it's safe before distribution
0/-1	please keep in touch with the old guy. check him every 3 months
1/1	please take the vaccine ...it gives you an active immunity... and this is to a good percentage protective! However it doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get covid anymore..you will just be stronger to fight it!!
1/1	please,, vaccine is to help all of humanity!
0/0	poison
0/0	poison ,no vaccine

0/1	press f to all people who took the vaccines
1/1	pro-vaccine forever.
1/1	pro-vaccine: medical and health professionals anti-vaccine: some randoms with strong opinions
0/0	proof that us "minoritys" are not sheep and much of the population are.. Wake up people stop watching the news and do your own research
0/-1	pure poison
0/0	raw garlic > vaccine
1/1	read the list of symptoms after getting infected and sick with Covid read that risk of death and serious illness is basically nonexistent after taking a vaccine understand primary school level statistics read about billions poured into vaccine development by countless countries, and all the emergency measures prioritising vaccines development through all the pipeline and understand that means some of the over the hundred teams would deliver fast understand that numerous specialists in the field have more gravity to their opinions than rag press, Kremlin propaganda or churches have 5G capable phone anyway Honestly, people who don't want to take vaccine for no good reason are not too smart, and are too prone to propaganda to be left to deciding on their own. Just look at what is happening in the Brasil where virus is spreading and mutating likely so fast it may outpace vaccine development. If people don't want to think about it... They're stupid and dangerous.
0	really struggling as a parent of 4 young boys, i personally dont see the point of putting something we dont know the long term effects of into our bodys to avoid getting something thatll be an inconvenience at best
1/1	received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
1/-1	remember folks, the symptoms of illness, the aches, pains, fever, etc. That's your immune system working, that isn't the virus itself making you feel that way, that's your body's defenses kicking on and a sign that it's taking the threat against you seriously.
1/1	remember kids even tho the needles are scary the flu or meseles were even more scary
0/1	remember kids when everyone else is doing cocaine and drinking...YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GIVE INTO PEER PRESSURE AND JUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	remember narcolepsi from vaccinations...
0/0	remember ‚Äúi am legend‚Äù yeah, me too
0/1	reports emerging from Norway indicate that at least twenty three people have died after taking the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, yet the government regulator has said they don‚Äôt see anything alarming in the cases‚Ä¶
1/1/1	request every individual to take vaccine and cooperate with our Government measures and follow it properly so that we all can defeat this kind of virus easily.We have to think about the front line workers as well and pray for everyone guiding and protecting us
0/0	rushed to market mRNA vaccines may do more harm than good.
0/0	sad that people have to get this poison
1/1	sadly people are dumb enough to do not take it

0/0	scared of dieing to the vacinnes more then covid
1/1	science have always helped human race, yet people don‚Äôt beilive in it
1/1	science is so cool, this is amazing news!
0/1/1/0	scientists who developed these vaccines are also speedrunners in their spare time confirmed
1/-1	screeching ahead on vaccinating population will be opening up to drive economy, ship excess vaccine to its friends, not EU commission! Travel from eu will be controlled as infection rates increase in Europe from the ever increasing variants. Sadly..AZ Oxford vaccine given to help Europe, EU. at cost price! The only answer, sadly the EU Commission fail the people of Europe
0/0	search results from the vaers database 'found 329 cases where vaccine targets covid-19 and patient died'.. No vaccine please
1/1	second shot 3/22. Worth it tho, I feel so much less anxiety going to work.
1/1	see people its safe! now go get your shot, if you all are tired of the lockdowns and lost of jobs...go get your shots!
1/1	seems like a lot of people don't wanna take it even when it is fully approved. it won't turn you into a zombie people!
0/0	she knows better. she ain't getting it.......No way will I put my trust in the corrupt Pharmaceutical Companies, or the CDC , who is a vaccine company . I would be safer trusting the Mafia.
1/1	sheeple who don‚Äôt vaccinate gonna die and take you along with them smh
1/1	shot 2 done right. Feel this one a little more than first shot but I was normal and will hopefully be perfect
1/1	shots! shots! shots!
1/-1	should have vaccinated your mom else you wouldnt have been born retarded
1/1	show me medication without side effects...not even aspirin
0/0	side effects
0/0	side effects are not disregardful
0/0/0/0	side effects is enough, that should be telling you NOT TO TAKE THIS FARKING poison. this is nothing but fear, good little boys and girls. Bollocks! NO FING way
0/0/0	side effects, just like covid symptoms hahaha.
1/1/1	signed up to be put on the list I‚Äôm Nervous but it took a a lot for me to do this I‚Äôm proud of myself
0/0	since all are so sure but why nor the companies nor the health ministries are accepting any responsibilities from side effects
0/0	smart people don't do it
0/0	smells like a whole lotta BS to me.... no thanks.
1/1	so amazing! Well done to everyone who has worked tirelessly on this vaccine.
1/1	so excited to see a vaccine in the works! let's hope that this will help get everything back to normal sooner
1/1	so far they have worked just less effectively against the new mutations, but a mutation could arise against which vaccines don't work, which is why we all need to get vaccinated really quickly, so the virus is unable to multiply and evolve.
0/0	so genetically modified humans?
0/-1	so getting a vaccine is pointless right now?
1/1	so glad i could help end this pandemic :) getting my second dose soon
0/0	so happy there's so many willing pro-Vs out there who trust big pharma with their own lives. so we don't have to.
1/1	so looking at your logic it seems that you would suggest we abandoned the smallpox vaccine the MMR vaccine the ebola vaccine the HPV vaccine the polio vaccine the typhoid vaccine? What's different about the covid vaccine AJ ??? It's just the way we fight viral disease ? Why is this so hard for you to understand?
1/1	so many effective vaccines already, let‚Äôs keep producing them so everybody around the world has access. We can do it!!!
0/-1	so many refusing to be vaccinated
0/0	so my take on the experiment and dagerous
1/1	so the vaccine that had multiple phase trials, no deaths, no hospitalizations, with success, is bad?
0/0	so this is how it starts.....6 today....how many next year?
0/0	so vaccines simply reduce the severity of the symptoms. ok. so then give it to those that are at the highest risk of dying from it right? ohhh never mind because the vaccine is also deadly to the "most frailest" aka the people at highest risk of dying from the virus... one is avoidable and the other authoritarian anti human rights assholes want to make mandatory. listen if any of you want to be literal lab rats that take the vaccine and die from it or maybe not knowing the vaccine makers have been given special protections against being held liable because of the known risks associated with such careless implementation then so be it but dont go forcing it on everyone else. if they told you the truth you would not take the vaccine but no they baby you and sugar coat it to make you feel like absolutely nothing can go wrong if you take it. it should be required by law that you know and understand the risks and why those risks exist and then you should have the ability to decide whether or not if you want to take those risks. i for one standing a better chance of winning the lottery than dying of covid would much rather just get covid than to take a new vaccine that has little to no testing and a rushed development cycle. when it comes to things liek the flu shot sure because we have had decades to do research and development for it but some thing like covid? hell no. a virus that of which not a single person on this planet had a physical sample of the virus for the first several months of the pandemic per the CDC and has mutated at least 3 times within a single year and you expect me to think its irrational not to get the rushed vaccine without question? craziness.
0/0	so when‚Äôs the funeral
0/0	so why does this vaccine change your RNA and DNA ?I no folks that have died from the vaccine with no health conditions?
1/0	so y'all care about long term effects of the vaccine but not covid?
1/1	some of you are thick as hell. 89% is so much higher than the current 0% we‚Äôve had for a year. Try counting to 89 and be more mindful in how long that takes compared to counting to one. Also, Be bloody grateful you‚Äôre still here and have even been able to see a vaccine develop - some people haven‚Äôt been so lucky!!!
1/-1	some people are vulnerable, but they can't take vaccines due to various reasons, they will rely the fellow citizens in the society to provide them the herd protection from the threat. So even people are not vulnerable, as a conscientious collective species, they are supposed to be smart enough to realize their responsibility for the survival of our whole human race.
0/-1	some people just really don't get that not everything is about them.
0	someone died after contracting vaccine
0/0	sorry it doesn‚Äôt work
0/0/0/0	sounds like they're just wasting our money on a vaccine that nobody wants

1/1	still would go for covaxin any day!
1	stop being dumb ppl, just take it already
0/0	stop persuading people to take something unknown and hasn‚Äôt been tested long term!
1/1	strong protection as vaccine mimics the natural infection process
0/0	swedes have learned from experience to not take any new vaccine. we will gladly wait to see what the effects are to avoid a repeat of the swine flu vaccine which ended up being statistically more dangerous than the swine flu were, not even close.
1/1	synthetic viruses during wars can always bring back eradicated diseases. Good to have vaccines , just in case.
1/1	t is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
1/1	take polio shots, never get polio.
1/1	take the Moderna one. It's safer.
1/1	take the vaccine and everything turns back to normal. if you refuse then we will be in this forever. think about others!
0/0	take your Vax and shove it as hard as humanly possible up your A$$
0/0	takin the vaccine is literally putting a computor in the body!!!
1/1	taking the shots soon. I have faith in humanity
1/1	talking about international effort, more details about the mRNA vaccines really shined some light to me what we really accomplished and what we still can accomplish as a society if we just dedicate ourselves to it! Much love to anyone who reads this and stay strong we'll get through this!
0/0	tbh I do not like vaccines. so ngl no vaccine for mee
1/1	tbh these anti-vaxxers are kinda weird
1/1	tell people to wear a mask, stay socially distanced, and get vaccinated.

1/-1	thank you
1/1	thank you Pfizer for the Vaccine I had my 2nd dose last March 25/21 no side effects!
1/-1	thank you all at MedCram - super helpful all the time and comforting in arming us with knowledge
1/1	thank you and all of the people who worked so hard to develop the Covid vaccine. I got my first dose on Friday. My only reaction was a slightly sore arm at the injection site.
1	thank you for telling me this I know my sister got the one so I'm going to get the Mederma I'm happy that everything's okay with both of you yay
1/1	thank you for volunteering...I am scheduled to get in the ph 3 J&J ph 3 study next week....so many people so quick to put down these studies and if it wasnt for people like you and me, a lot more people would die of this virus as well as many other diseases, in particular cancer!
1/0	thank you for your message. we need more of this in the world right now. because the subject has many confusing elements to it (e.g. exponential growth, CFR vs IFR, excess deaths, the flu kills x) people are getting confused. many do not accept how serious it is and think the figures are trumped up.
1/1/1/1/1/1	thank you so much for making a video like this, I know that some people, no matter how much evidence you show them, will still deny it and be scared, but it certainly helps having people logically explain how safe this stuff actually is
1	thank you, my hopes are raised, I might be vaccinated
1/1	thankful for these people who are willing to help the process for the betterment of the world. You guys are warriors!!!
1/1	thanks a lot for the clear explanation. So is the vaccine safe and effective.
1/1	that beautiful light blue color around the Bay Area shows we have very low vaccine hesitancy here! Bay Area proud baby
0/-1	that is not needed at all cause immune systems do that anyways
0/0	that means personal responsibility which is something people find offensive. I'd rather be responsible for myself than to trust someone else- or a doctor or gov't
0/0	that vaccine isn't going anywhere in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
0/0	that vaccines clearly killing people and yall expect ppl to get it
1/1	that's a normal reaction to the vaccine,most people have that.she should be fine soon
1/1	that's great to hear! Im still waiting for the vaccine to be available to me. My whole family has been fully vaccinated and im still waiting for the vaccine to be ready for teens but when it's been tested and out im taking the vaccine
0/0	that's what the clinical trials are for - would be nice if they were complete before we pushed this on everyone. not everyone wants to sign up for the trial and be part of the experiment.
0/0/0	thats like saying- shoot me in the head first- and i will take notes afterward...
0/0	the 'current' vaccine that doesnt protect you from getting or giving covid is already useless.
1/1	the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine already had its 3rd trial which supports its positive results elsewhere in the World
1/0	the People who think that the scary stuff in vaccines should be removed are not anti-vaccine, they‚Äôre anti-science
1/1	the UK, Canada and now the US are authorizing the use of the Pfizer vaccine! if it is OK for them why not us? What on earth are the EMA doing.....! perhaps the UK did do the right thing by authorizing the vaccine on their own and forgetting about the dumb solidarity of EU's licensing programme....!
1/1	the amount of anti-vaxxers in the comments is scary. if you don't want the vaccine, do not complain about no getting to travel this summer/this year.
1/-1	the amount of antivax friends i have is ASTOUNDING!! and i had no clue!!
1/1	the anti vax people. Simply ridiculous.
1/1/1	the antivaccines people are that type of people who said "i don t know" if they re ask for their allergies
1/1	the benefits of this vaccine far outweighs the risk of anything else
1/1	the best thing people can do, is stop watching the "news"..
1/1	the best vaccine is the first one you have access to
0/-1	the best way to cure covid 19 is to stop watching tv
1/1	the big problem is the lake of trust in poletics and the unfaer system. Thats al
1/1	the country needs more vaccines and we need them fast.. We are all wanting to do them.!!
1/1	the day you filmed this was the date of my second shot. and yeah it was a lil rough. it was like a one and a half day flu ü§í but i‚Äôd take that over a month of covid!!!
0/0	the deaths are from the vaccines are rising
0/0	the drug companies have no liability should anything go wrong.
0/-1	the end is near the end is near!!!
1/1	the expectation in government is that for the next few years people will need regular booster jabs to protect against new variants of covid, as with the flu jab
0/0	the fact that some people gladly show off their ‚ÄúVaccine shots‚Äù on social media and are so glad, makes me wonder how different some people really are
1/1	the first dose is fairly effective and will prevent most from dying
0/0	the flu vaccine brings out the flu so wouldn't the covid-19 vaccine bring out covid-19 in someone bc that's why i never get a flu shot!!
0/-1	the good news is my kid does not have small pox. the bad news is he bangs his head into the wall all day. and can't talk.
1/1	the government are trying to save lives, get your vaccine done
0/0	the government controls the vaccines therefore they re all bad
0/0	the government wants to control us, they can litterarly make us do anything. I'm not letting anyone inject anything in me!
0/0	the govt wants to put their crap in me, no way that‚Äôs happening
0/0	the human body is 99.997 effective, why would i take some rushed illgates poison ?
0/0	the immune system is one of the most complicated systems in the body. we are nowhere near understanding all the feedback loops and mechanisms in it. To alter it by having your body constantly produce a trigger is unwise. like injecting pollen daily into asthmatics.
1/1	the last administration hadn't set up any distribution plans and this one is trying to get caught up. He's only had 2 weeks.
1/1	the list of ingredients for Moderna/Pfizer are incredibly simple, and none of them concerned me as a pharmacist
0/0	the long term side effects of these vaccines wont be realized until 3-5 yrs. after taking them. I am, not gonna take it‚Ä¶
1/1	the mRNA in the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell because it doesn‚Äôt have the necessary signal. But, even if it did, mRNA would need to be converted into DNA via an enzyme the vaccine doesn‚Äôt possess. Thus it is indeed safe!
0/0/1/0	the main stream media already said it would take a miracle for a vaccine that be out this early. So no I'm not gonna take one.
1/1	the nice thing is that we don't need to leave a choice, the government can mandate it.
1/-1	the only person that should't the vaccine is that one guy on gta that's level 1,000 or higher
1/1	the only side effect i had from the covid vaccine was all the bad dreams i had last night
0/0/1/0	the only thing I'm going to wear strapped to my body anymore is my 9 mm. NO MORE MASKS!
1/1	the only way to the freedom is taking this vaccine‚Äô
1/0	the problem with must of you is that you will gladly drink, eat, snore and inject poisons in your body, your precious temple........you must hate yourself so much and you rather believe in the 'devil'
0/0/0	the reason is money. we are vaccinating for unecessary childhood illnesses, and worse we are making them manditory.
0/0	the reason theyre threatening to make it mandatory or you lose your ability to go in public, and hire celebrities to ad their gene experimentation jab is because MOST dont want it. if they really had so much demand, they wouldnt need to advertise it so much. and think about it... it's always "safe and effective"
1/1	the reward for people under 40 is that they won't get sick, AND that they will be protecting their parents and other older people in their community. where did you get this 5-10% from? no, vaccines don't make you sterile.
1/1	the risk is lower than Birth control, why aren't birth control being ban immediately?
1/1	the risks from taking vaccines are astronomically lower than the risks from the diseases the vaccines
1/0	the risks of getting covid outweigh the risks of the vaccine
1/1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high.
1/1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high. if enough people are vaccinated then the anti vaxxers will be fine because of herd immunity but if no one gets vaccinated, they will all be seriously ill and die at a younger age.
1/-1	the salt in his voice when he mentioned antivax was enough to cure a pig
0/0	the shot just killed a friend of mine ,the first one made him feel bad and the second one killed him . severe side effects are going unreported to keep people getting the shots .Clovis Fikes was his name .
1/1	the side effects are minimal and no one has died from the vaccine while many people have died from covid. which is why you need to get vaccines on a schedule? Not just this Covid one. But every vaccine. It‚Äôs the same reason you need to get your flu shot yearly. To make sure that you‚Äôre effectively protected
1/1	the side effects are still better then getting covid
0/0	the side effects are worse then covid
0/-1	the side effects like joint pain, fatigue, having your entire body's organs monitored and evendestroyed by the tech particles in it, fever, etc.. U know, just the usual
0/0	the so-called COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù don‚Äôt work like vaccines. They‚Äôre designed to lessen symptoms when the inoculated person gets infected, but they do not actually prevent them from getting infected in the first place, and they don‚Äôt prevent the spread of the virus.
1/1	the solution: get vaccinated
0/0/0	the thing Im mostly amazed with is people thinking the government cares about them. A relative of mine just died the day after she got vaccine. THIS IS TRUE!
1/-1	the thoughts of these scientists doing actual productive research to the betterment of humankind.... and then there's tictok - ers like charlie & bella, earning as much, if not more.... just makes me wonder tf is wrong with the world.
0/0	the va$$ines are killing people
0/0	the vaccination is more dangerous than the disease. We know the survival rate for COVID-19 and it is not deadly enough to warrant taking a rushed and untested vaccine in which there may be very negative long term consequences
0/1	the vaccine is a gift from God, the sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner you meet him
0/0	the vaccine is killing so many fragile, elderly. that should frighten everyone
0/1	the vaccine is made by man and man is not perfect. how can we expect that it will be perfect and free of any side effects
0/0	the vaccine is more deadly than theh covid itself.
0/0	the vaccine is not effective enough
1/1/0	the vaccine is not live COVID
1/1	the vaccine is our best line of defense against this awful pandemic.
1/1	the vaccine is our only chance right now in ending this pandemic and we all want our lives back, I think you can't do wrong in getting it. I understand that it can be frightening but all vaccines that are available in your country are well tested and effective
0/0	the vaccine is safe it might just kill you.
0/0	the vaccine literally almost killed my uncle.
1/1	the vaccine means that a new hope is coming that thie nightmare might end and we might get back to our normal life...
1/1	the vaccine rollout's been going really well here but we cannot fix people who think that covid/vaccination/public health is a hoax
1/1/1/1/1/1	the vaccine should be mandatory
0/0	the vaccine will kill us all
1/1	the vaccines can WORK‚Ä¶they are working for so many other disease..now also for the virus!!
1/1	the vaccines have already started to change my community! things are reopening like schools, restaurants for indoor dining, Theme parks and movie theaters, And much more! Thank god we have this vaccine!
1/1/1	the vaccines work beautifully. To prevent serious infections and deaths, to prevent the spread, to save lives. We ALL know that we could still get it but thanks to the vaccine our immune system already knows what to do. Now let' s try THIS as an headline!
1/0	the whole anti-vaxxer movement is basically a bunch of peoole saying "i can medicine better than doctors"
0/0	the worst part is the sh!t aint even a vaccine smh.
0/-1	there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE
0/0	there hasn't been enough time to say " no long term side effects".
0/0	there is no clue of what the side effects are
0/0	there is no covid we don't need a vaccine
1/1	there is no need to be afraid from the vaccine. Everything gonna be alright
1/1	there is no reason not to vaccinate your kids
0	there isnt enough money in this world to pay me to take that shot...
0/0	there no such thing as a vaccine for RNA viruses, this has never been done before nor can it be done, there is also no such thing as a coronavirus more dangerous than your regular flu.
0/0	there was not yet enough evidence from vaccine trials "to be confident that it's going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on
1/1	there's a 0.01% chance that I'll trip and injure myself while walking anti vaxxers: guess I won't walk
0/0	theres no evdence of a pandemic
1/1	there‚Äôs no reason for an able-bodied person to not get the vaccine unless you seem to enjoy lockdowns and mask rules
1/1	these anti vaccine people dont see the bigger picture.
0/0	these are NOT vaccines, they are genetic manipulation - as per Pfizer & Monsanto
0/0	these are not vaccines they are gene therapies experimental not approved by the FDA this one has aborted baby parts in it Wake up America
1/1	these people are overreacting‚Ä¶my parents got their vaccine and are doing perfectly fine
1/1	these vaccines were made in a very different way, mrna, and becouse of lot of funding, a lot of people volunteering for vaccines trials, new technology and past knowledge about previous epidemics and the virus has a very slow rate of mutation
0/0	they also skipped animal trials. There is no way I am getting that vaccine. I will move states if they require it I am not taking that vaccine.
1/1	they are a variety of vaccines based on 10 year old or even 50 year old technology (based on an idea from the 1700s). And they have been tested. On thousands of people. And approved by multiple health authorities.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
0/0	they create the virus. Now they want to gigypig us all
0/-1	they don't trust it..
1/0	they had a reaction but not too nasty but the BBC think better run a scare story so the Twitter fools can rant.
0/0	they had to dump 15 million doses two weeks ago. No thank you...
0/0	they have been vaccinating for however long and yet the flu returns year after year in new variants. my family stopped taking the flu shots and we stopped getting the flu every year. so i am talking from personal experience. I say NO to this covid19 vaccine and that is my personal choice. We still have freedom of choice right?
0/0	they have not been thoroughly tested over time - producing effective, safe antisera takes far more time than these have been given. They are being touted as safe and effective, but check out different studies - there are many undesirable side effects. And you can never be unvaccinated
1/1	they have not been. The information is readily available. Unfortunately, most people don't do any actual research because it takes time. If they did they would understand that there have been no deaths attributed to the vaccines. As for injuries, all side effects are listed and resolved but this information isn't looked for either.
0	they started giving vacine but even after the taking shot same people again infected of Corona Virus so wt is the use of giving vacine.
0/0	they will establish a new world order with the vaccines
1/1	they will require vaccination because they are trying to save lives! If you haven't taken the vaccine, and COVID is still spreading, you are a threat to society! We need most people to take the vaccine for COVID to actually go away. Even if there are unknown long term side effects, we do know that COVID is dangerous and has killed almost a million people and must be eradicated!
1/1	they work they work they work they work!!!!! Do the vaccines asap‚Ä¶
0/0/0/0	they've been giving vaccinations for decades, and not one has been successful to any great percentage...count me out...I'll rely on God and my natural defenses.
0/0	they‚Äôd also be gambling by getting the vaccines. Vaccines have been known to cause SIDS, epilepsy and other serious conditions or death. They‚Äôre both risky.
0/0	they‚Äôre not telling us what the vaccine is made out of
0/0	think Covid-19 is not a problem
0/0	this CONFIRMS the vaccines are another lie
0	this a scam either there is no syrum in the vaccine or the oil enters the syringe do not trust what it has shown you without having formal proof
1/1	this can save millions of lives
1/1/1	this great news about the the Vaccine, why so many dislikes???
1/1	this is amazing
1/0	this is amezing wwery gratefull for this good explanation
0/1	this is an untried new type of RNA Vaccine...paints any kind of Vaccine reluctance as 'anti-vax' in its patently disgusting biased non - journalism.
1/-1	this is awesome
0/0	this is experimental, is being used under emergency authorization
0/0/0	this is good info, i'll pass on the vaccine. my body my choice right?
1/-1	this is interesting
0/0	this is not the same as a seatbelt in any way. Besides, you can choose not to wear a seatbelt. That doesn‚Äôt deny you the right to own or drive a car. Just like you can choose not to have a vaccine. That should NOT deny you the right to perform any function in your daily life. Some people will be unable to be vaccinated- what about them? Maybe the whole solution is that if YOU have a problem or concern, YOU should stay home and abstain from life. NONE of this was required a year ago, and NONE of this should be required now.
0/0	this is really stupid move to vaccine people,when we have less people dieing .
1/1	this is so helpful tbh. I'm going to get the vaccine when they have one in our town.
1/1	this is so sad can we have vaccine parties
0/0	this is what happens whne drugs are not properly trialed
1/-1	this is where the eu are slow again the uk have already ordered vaccines for 2022 and 2025
0/0	this is why i never take vaccines! the only times i took them was 3to 4!!!
0/0	this is why they want to force or shame everyone to get it , so they don't have an unvaccinated population to prove how many thousands or millions they kill by being failed vaccine
1/1	this is why we need M4A, so people actually visit their doctor and cut back on all the woo woo pseudoscience nut job substitute for healthcare. Not having healthcare as a human right is morally wrong and destroying the country
1/1	this isn't about politics. COVID is killing people and we need to save lives. It's very important to actually look at the facts and realize that you need to take the vaccine
1/0	this made me realise that cells are smarter then antivaxxers
0/0	this poison so called vaccine doesnt stop you catching this flu let alone stopping you from spreading it" best result they say ??? is that it softens the side effects from this flu" and guess what many new strains are being reported worldwide which will make it completly useless " jab on brainless sheep"
0/0	this should not be called vax. It doesn‚Äôt work on the same basis. It‚Äôs genetic coding that‚Äôs unproven in experimental stage. That should be enough to scare any sane person.
1/0	this vaccine also uses a novel method of action, using mrna encoding the virus rather than the virus itself. fantastic proof of concept for new technology
0/0	this vaccine brought to you by big pharma, pls give us your money we will use it to make more viruses thanks
1/1	this vaccine is safe.
0/0	this vaccine my have had a lot of tests But not the test of time
1/1	this vaccine works and it bypassed animal studies and basic long term safety tests.
1/1	this video changed me i will take any vaccine i can get.
1/1/1	this video has slammed these idiotic anti vaccine communities on their reasons to avoid vaccination
0/0	this whole vaccine trail just feels like the start of every zombie movie.
0/0	those are GENE THERAPIES not vaccines . No way im gonna take it
1/1	those doctors didn't go through 10+ years of school to have someone who makes clothes tell them about 50% of their course material. Girl, they know it's safe-ish better than having your child dead-ish.
0/0	those vaxed who are worried about those not vaxed dont believe in the vax
0/-1	thousands dying, good to know ‚Äúskinwalker joe‚Äù is safe

1/1	to all the people with their little tinfoil hats, gl.
1/1	to be honest with you I just can‚Äôt wait to have my vaccines, one more one less it won‚Äôt change much since i‚Äôm still going to die one day. but with the vaccine at least i‚Äôll feel better psychologically
0/0	to me the vaccine is one way for the government to wipe millions of people out without pulling a trigger
1/1	to stop covid 19 - vaccine!
1/-1	to the naysayers, you know you can choose not to get vac right,if you so kiasi, you can be the last one to vac after everybody as long as you not kiasu

1/1	uhhhhh they will be the ones alive you idiot.
0	uk gov has to wind down covid figures just so sheep believe that vaccine working when its probably contributing to more side effects or deaths.Whos betting that they continue this and tease coming out of lockdown and then at last moment reveal some cooked up new mutant variant.
1/1	upon receiving my second dose of the covid vaccine today, i thanked my nurse for all of her service. she said it was her honor and she thanked me for my service in return
1/1	ust got my second dose Sunday and all I got was a sore arm. The next day I felt just the sore arm and by night time I was good. The next day all normal. Just get it done you‚Äôll be happy and glad you‚Äôre done with already. Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse

0/-1	vaccine effectiveness wont be long
1/1	vaccine efficacy all I have to say is that having had mild to moderate covid (which was brutal) I'd very happily be jagged in the arm with something that didn't protect much against that in the future but still did a fair bit to stop me from ending up in hospital or dying
1/1	vaccine harm is overblown by some and underestimated by others, i want to take the vacc
0/0	vaccine has medical ethics problem
0/0	vaccine is Nano technology and has human components and poisons in it. Research the actual ingredients and you will see it is toxic. and if we get hit with a CME or EMP all those Nano bots will fry you like your in a microwave oven !!!!!

1/1	vaccine is here already and it‚Äôs rolling great.
1/1	vaccine is our only chance right now in ending this pandemic and we all want our lives back

0/1	vaccines are modern day blood-letting
0/0	vaccines are poisonous. doctors give their patients vaccines so they could get sick & come back for treatment. Vaccines are basically toxic chemicals being put in your body.

0/0	vax have killed countless numbers of infants and old folk., vax to not work at all. you can not prove vax are safe and work.
1/-1	very reassuring thanks for the 7 day vid!

0/0	wait til your immune system totally crumbles.... next man made virus.
1/1	wait until there's another polio outbreak in US, then those anti-vaxxers might shut up
0/0	wake up do your own research don't rely on a bunch of corrupt 'experts' that have their heads buried in an Aldi bag. As Craig kelly demonstrated covid 19 can be treated with ivermectin, there is a 99% recovery rate. the real issue here is Gates invested millions into vaccines and is determined to push it at all costs.

0/0	we arent anti vaxxers. I know I'm not anyway. I had all of my shots as a kid and when I joined the military. My 3 year old son also has his vaccines and boosters. I dont believe in anti vaxxing, however I refuse to put something in my body that took less than a year to make that's not proven to fight a virus. There was no mass studies and trials with it. If you call that anti vaxxing then I dont know what to tell you.
1/1	we barely know the long term risks of COVID-19 too. I'd sooner have just the RNA of the spike protein injected in to my tissue than have the whole bat virus taking over me.
1/1	we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
0/1	we don't know what sort of side effects may come out later, but quit being scared and take the shot, we think it's safe

1/1	we relied heavily on previous vaccine research to develop it, including research on other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS making it completely reliable!
1/1	we tried to mitigate to keep activities open, as we can't afford to close them anymore, and hoping in vaccines. Covid Zero just can't be applied here (In my opinion)

1/1	we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them

1/1	what a shame. this will slow down vaccinations and cause even more hesitation. chance of clotting with the vaccine is 0.0000068% while actually catching covid is 16.5%. horrible decision
1/1	what about the literal millions that have died from covid itself. It‚Äôs a huge country of course things can go wrong especially with medical stuff. But for the most part this thing is stomping out covid.

0/-1	why would you put your life in to this risk huh
1/1	why yes I support a healthy physique and scientific research on vaccines, how did you know?
1/1	why??????what's wrong with vaccines?????
1/1	will be getting mine soon, need to protect not only myself but my children and grandchildren. Side affects seem small compared to risk of death.
1/1	will definitely be taking that vaccine!
1/1	will help to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19
0/-1	will people actually ever get vaccinated?
1	with the reports around what even asymptomatic COVID could do to a healthy set of lungs in the long term vaccination is far preferable to mild to moderate
1/1	with the vaccine here, I hope things will get better.
0/1	woah this is all so cool! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s important to be safe and reaserch the vaccines before you get them of course, but this video seems really interesting! I see your getting a lot of comments trashing the science and depending on conspiracy, so i just want to say thank you for the time and effort for making this! i enjoyed it :)
0/0	won't be getting it, thanks.
1/0	work for a major healthcare provider and even then they‚Äôll only provide UPTO for going to get it. Some of my coworkers are even holding off getting the vaccine for that very reason.

1/1	wow.. science is wonderful.. imagine how many disciplines it takes to build all those stuff... I feel like a dot of dust, or probably a mere electron now :D
0/1	y father is a Doctor Epidimologist and he has been threatened not to speak, since this vaccine comes way too early and it needs at least 2 to 3 years future testing. Second of all my father said COVID-19 is getting mutation with time, which means it's changing and this vaccine is for the previous covid structure and not for the new one. Plus that we do not know the exact side effects of this vaccine.....
1/1	y'all also realize people experience different things??so if one person reacts negatively that doesn't mean YOU will.
1/1	y'all eating McDonald's and ramen noodles on a daily while drinking cola and think a vaccine is unsafe

0/1	yep then we end up like i am legend
1/-1	yes
0/0	yes hard to believe because the flu shot made me really sick for 6 weeks why i never do it again this be no different
1/1	yes i do, because vaccinating is a good thing in almost every way and i don't tend to believe conspiracies either
1/1	yes if it means we can get back to life again, I'm all for it.
0/0	yes they mutate when the population is immune so we were immune , so why did we need this vaccine.
0/0	yes vaccines like the antivirus update of BGates. We commoners will take chances and leave vaccines to rich ones.
1/-1	yes! All women in medicine should be celebrated
1/1	yes, i got the vaccine. & yes, i‚Äôm getting my vaccination card laminated & putting it in my passport case.
1/1	yes, the vaccine cannot stop the virus from entering our bodies, but the great benefit comes from the previous "training" our immune system undergoes when presented with the antigen contained in the vaccine.
1/1	yes. im so excited. please lets give everyone the shot so we can finally get on with our lives
0/-1	yesterday, i was sent an invitation letter for a covid vaccination. today, i used it to line a cat litter tray!
1/-1	yet, no evidence, to prove the point you're making, stop being married to your conspiracy theories with no evidence.
0/0	you all don't know the long term effects of this vaccine and everyone is having some kind of symptom from taking it
1	you are alive today due to vaccination.
1/1	you asked: Why take the vaccine if you're not completely protected? Because it takes time to become immune, as well as a booster shot to reach 95% effectiveness. Some people also have weaker or compromised immune system responses and can only be protected by herd immunity. We would need about 70% of the population to be vaccinated before we can accomplish that. In the meantime, we'll still need to wear masks and physically distance.
0/0	you can take your vaccine and shove it up your corrupt arse. keep your needles away.
1/0	you cannot have 100% safety with any drug, I don‚Äôt understand why people expect it from this vaccine .

1/1	you know we are so lucky this isn‚Äôt the like I don‚Äôt know 1970s. Cuz guess what? We have the internet. We can communicate with people who are across the world in one second. I understand it‚Äôs hard not to see people in person but please make an effort to protect yourself and the community and get the vaccine üò´ think about the people who can‚Äôt even get vaccines because of maybe a immune problem or something, those people are at high risk and if everyone gets the vaccine they will be protected. We need to think about other people more We also don‚Äôt know the long term effects. Someone could get COVID, lose it feel perfectly fine and 10 years later something bad happens to them and it turns out it‚Äôs a side effect from COVID.

0/0	you're wrong buddy.In a vaccine, you don't administer the whole intact virus, but rather a small part of it. or at least you weaken it first. BUT DON'T THAKE THE COVID VACCINE. IT IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST!

1	‚ÄúCOVID-19 is far more likely to cause blood clots than a COVID-19 vaccine‚Äù. While this is definitely true, I suspect most people rationalize not wanting to take this vaccine by thinking that they will be able to take appropriate measures to not contract COVID at all (and hence the changes of blood clots are now zero), as opposed to taking the vaccine and voluntarily making chances of blood clots, however small they may be, non-zero.

No vaccine in human history has been tested and approved in under 5 years, yet somehow the MSM deep state puppet news and their talking heads expect us to naively believe they have not one, but several Covid-19 "vaccines" ready to go? Also, the newly proposed mRNA mutagenic ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are not your typical vaccines of the past, they can and likely reprogram your DNA and even the scientists do not understand the full ramifications of this. The CEO of Pfizer sold 62% of his shares the very day the company declares their ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is 90% effective - pretty sketchy timing! Pfizer Inc., itself, has a lengthy civil and criminal record of paying out billions of dollars in damages for crimes, including safety violations, bribery, corruption, and false claims. It paid out a 2.3 billion dollar fine - the largest combination civil and criminal healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice. Why did Big Pharma have legislation passed that protects them from being held liable for any damages their "vaccines" cause if they truly believe in them so much? Why is there a relentless and unified global push to vaccinate the global population for a PLANdemic that has a 99.8% survivability rate for people under 70?

0/0	üåàA healthy man doesn't need to be vaccinated of any covid 19 vaccine because covid 19 is not harmful for everyone and the vaccine is not a solution because covid 19 mutilated itself with time second thing, can a vaccine treat body inflammation or pneumonia? answer is no! and the third thing is. If covid 19 is so fatal it would have killed every affected patient. And next thing why the death ratio is different through out the world . it is patient body's overwhelming action on corona that makes the situation worst and because of this patient's body get inflamed and later he faces septicemia and it is a cause of death. In some cases the patient faces some heart and kidney related problems. and the thing is responsible for this, it is inflammation because inflammation damages patient's respiratory system and it is the reason for whole crisis. Because in lack of oxygen the patient's body system get destroyed and septicemia make the situation dreadful . because of it patient's body lose it's capability to kill the virus. I make you sure that The patient's body has capability to fight against covid 19 no matter what type of virus is that. but it needs time and the patient has to avoid inflammation . and it is the way the patient can avoid inflammation till the body produces antibodies against the virus. Believe or not we can stop our body inflammation by controlling our eating habits it is possible. I am a patient of pneumonia myself and I was fed up of allopathic treatment but I followed some aurvedic instructions and some research was done by myself , today I am hundred percent healthy. I don't take a single pill to treat pneumonia because I don't face it since last two years. There is no possible vaccine for corona and only Ayurveda can save from this mysterious virus. millions of experimets have been carried out no result. If someone gets affected with covid 19 he should eat only the following things. if a corona patient eats the following things his body would not produce mucus and he is safe - the things are - wheat, gram(chana) , white sugar, milk ( milk from animals) and all products made from milk , salt, red chili, mutton, chicken, fish, mustered oil, tea, masoor dal(peagion food ) ,green leaves but not Cobbage, remember all this products mustn't be contaminated and they must be pure. if the patient eat these things and don't eat enything else and follows these instructions strictly. it is nothing but common cold. it takes 15 to 18 days because the patient has already eaten something that his body would take 15 days to stop producing mucus. If someone get affected with covid 19 he must consume the said foods because this thing takes 15 to 16 days and if someone delays to apply this thing. The situation would be out of control so apply this thing immediately and the patient must wash his nose with hot water. I mean warm water and inhale hot water thrice a day by his nose and he shouldn't mix the cold water into the hot water to get the temperature down because if he does so. I don't know why but the result will be zero. so to get the temperature down either the patient can pour the water or he should wait for some time. I think Patient nose is a heaven for the virus because neither body's action nor medicine works there the patient must wash his nose. how, it is on himself because virus enter into the lungs from here and the patient get affected again and again. it is my personal experience and please have a trust on it.the patient mustn't eat the fruits neither a single bite and others vegetables besides green leaf because fruits and vegetables are the main source or cause to makes our body producing mucus. It means if the patient follows the said instructions his body never get inflammation and a healthy person doesn't need to follow this formula. It is for those who are under threat and either they have a history of pneumonia or they are in their old ages and patients of diabetes or at high risk. besides them no need to worry it is only common cold for a healthy person nothing more. I am a patient of pneumonia and I have been researching on pneumonia for last 18 years. if the patient trusts this thing. and applying this thing. he never need a vantilater and he never going to face any worst or a death. do you know why the death ratio is less in poor countries. it is the reason. the poor people don't eat fruits and vegetables as much compare to the richer and mostly the rich people have been dying with corona. a six month old child never faces pneumonia because he fed only its mother's milk. a wild animal never face pneumonia because he never eats another feed besides green leaves, a man never faces pneumonia if he eats the said things. and if you get over with it once you needn't to worry at all( if you are not a patient of pneumonia). friends pneumonia made my body too sensitive. so I discovered this thing. it took me 18 to 20 years to sort out these things. I have most sensitive body because if I eat an orange I get a body pain immediately and if I eat rice continously for four and five days I get cold that turns itself into pneumonia after one or two days I have faced corona and it took me 16 days To get rid of it and it was like a some different kind of cold for me i lost my appetite, smell and test. I became weak but I saved my life because I am on the said diet already but if I won't have known this thing I would be a dead man yet for sure with this therapy you can cure gangrene, septicemia or such wounds that not have been getting cured for long time. It takes fifteen to eighteen days to get the results starting. (A healthy person must avoid fruits and vegetables during the infection. and an under threat person must eat the said foods during the infection) Note: vitamin c daily value is different for different people. a patient of pneumonia needs very little amount of vitamin c and green leaves like spinach and lettuce can full fill this need perfectly.
