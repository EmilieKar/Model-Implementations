1	As someone who has studied viruses and worked in research labs on other coronaviruses like MERS-cov and SARS-cov, it makes me laugh to hear Erika say "that's not a risk she's willing to take" because the risks of the disease are far more dangerous than the worst risks of the vaccine.
1	Just get the vaccine guys..
1	This doen't really make sense. What difference does it make if the testing took place during one peak vs another? Even if there are more people infected around, that shouldn't change anything. The vaccine should protect you regardless.
1	I‚Äôm laughing at how people care more about the side effects then the positive affects, Like not dying!
0	won't be getting it, thanks.
1	want vaccine

1	Two things that never gets old 1) Making fun of  anti-vaxxers 2) Their kids
0	Not going to take it
1	I‚Äôm getting it, I trust it. However, doctors and scientists are not helping themselves by saying ‚Äúyou still have to wear a mask for the long haul, even after both shots.‚Äù You want people to stop saying this is social engineering? Then stop the propaganda
0	We are worried about a 2% death rate. Well, just with ordinary vaccines themselves, there is 2% serious adverse reactions. No one talks about that. There is no drug or vaccine that is 100% safe for everyone
1	ofc i'm taking it!
1	With so many not vaccinating and spreading eradicated viruses, I want more vaccines as fast as possible, especially mmr.
1	I‚Äôm curious as to when in medical history there hasn‚Äôt been side effects. I need to see causation. This is speculative.
1	The only way to care of others in this pandemic is to take the vaccine as soon as you get the oppurtunity.
0	I never took the flu shot I'm sure not taking this vaccine
1	Only 6 out of over six million people had adverse effects? I see no reason to stop the J&J vaccine.
1	I had side effects, from nausea to fever to aches. The nights were the worst. On the 4th day I slept it off. I never worried knowing my body was doing its job. I missed a day of work. I hope my 2nd shot is smoother, but if it's not, I'm still celebrating.
1	I was vaccinated with the vaccine a couple weeks ago, I had the chills for about 40 minutes that evening. Thats it for side effects and I appreciate that If I get Covid it won't be a serious case. I continue to social distance and mask wearing in indoor public spaces.
1	First dose on board March 24th. #2 coming up. Science is freaking amazing!
0	Uhm, u can keep that crap.
0	There have been severe side effects, including death, with the other two vaccines too but were ignored by the CDC. Something strange is going on.
0	donot want it
1	I hope this helps.
1	Any vaccine Dr. Anthony Fauci recommends is one I will get.
0	As much as I'm glad that a vaccine is being used. I'm scared about the long-term health effects of a rushed vaccine.
0	My immune system is their for a reason,if someone chooses to receive it I respect that ,they better respect my choice also.
0	Sadly I don‚Äôt trust either our government agencies or the drug companies to be honest with us at this point, and there is no telling what this experimental gene therapy will actually do in the future years.
1	Already been a little over six hours since my first dose, and aside of the ungodly arm pain I‚Äôm experiencing right now, I‚Äôm feeling fine. #CovidVaccine
0	If you die and could be suspected of having had covid within the past 12 months it's labelled as "covid death" and  becomes main stream news. f you die within 48 hours after being vaccinated it's played off as "no cause for concern" or "the patient was  too frail".
1	Not everyone wants that crap, for a disease that has a 90 percent cure rate.
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types!
1	Scientists were prepared for a pandemic while we were thinking about the zombies apocalypse. XDXD
1	I have a 20 something colleague who got Covid June last year. They were very fit - into martial arts and MMA. They now struggle to get upstairs without wheezing. They weren't hospitalised at the time. They felt a bit "ick" for few days (their own words "like I had a bad cold"), got "better" but some effects have still lingered. I got my second dose of (Pfizer) vaccine on Monday (30 something yo health professional). Yesterday (Tues) it was like I'd been hit by a wrecking ball - high temperature (over 38 degrees), aching everywhere, chills. Really not a fun 24 hours, and even today I still have a bit of a fever, a stiff neck, and a headache, but I'm functional. Would I trade that "feeling absolute rubbish for 48 hours but then being fine and protected" for "I'll take the chance I'll only get something mild, but it could disable me for months, if not permanently"? Not on your nelly.
1	Parents shouldn't decide! Your kid is not your property.
1	It‚Äôs bad enough him and his oppos talking out of their ****s to the detriment of their citizens but the ongoing issue of confidence in what has now been proven to be an effective vaccine will no doubt have a fatal knock on effect. Shameful excuses for leaders.
0	Yea and that's why the majority of us "the smart people" yall trying to sell this bogus quick profits to ain't buying them ever. I'm gonna take my 98% chances everyday before I take any one of them. I'll get sick 50 times before I consider taking anything you'll are selling. What doesnt kills you, equips you
1	Facebook are still refusing to take down anti vaccine profiles.
1	I'm getting my second shot soon.üíâ
1	I hope that the rest of the (United) States will open their eyes and understand the real plan here
1	I get my second shot tomorrow!  Also, the 5G signal has gotten really strong in my city! Thanks everyone
0	My friend died today after receiving the vaccine, 12 hours earlier. Shortness of breath with heart failure followed. She was perfectly fine. A teacher at the high school is in ICU after receiving the vaccine. So I ask you, are cases being ignored at this time to benefit the vaccine being used or are more people having side effects that are not being reported with the relationship to the vaccine?
1	Here‚Äôs your daily reminder: take whatever vaccine you are offered. Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&J- they‚Äôre all good & being regulated. You‚Äôd rather have the vaccine than COVID, and vaccines are a major part of how we end this crisis & return to mixing/socialising & an open economy.
1	Not using rhe AZ vaccine is madness. This is an unprecedented health emergency and now some governments are getting as hysterical as the anti-vaxxer nut jobs.
0	I'm with you!! I'm not getting it either.
0	If the vaccine is so safe, then why it's soo free? Doesn't make sense. The government always tax u for something soo safe right üòÖ
1	Should've mentioned this earlier, but I'm glad to hear that your mom got vaccinated; I imagine that reduces your stress considerably.
0	Work on Saturday was voluntary; however, those who refused would have their rations reduced by half (Animal Farm).
0	They‚Äôre already recalling the Johnson and Johnson vaccine but y‚Äôall wanna tell me to get it. Lmao tf y‚Äôall are SHEEEEEEEEEPPPPP
1	The only reasonable action is to take the vaccine
1	‚ÄúI‚Äôve driven home drunk countless times and I haven‚Äôt gotten in an accident once so I don‚Äôt see what the big deal is.‚Äù  That‚Äôs how that guy sounds.
1	I buy the AstraZeneca vaccine.
0	The immune system was created to handle things like this!
1	If you are afraid of a vaccine I can't imagine how many other things you people are afraid of in life keep hiding in your safe spaces you fucking babies
0	ANYBODY SERIOUSLY BELIEVING VACCINES ARE RESEARCHED DEVELOPED AND LOGISTICALLY ROLLED OUT IN 8 MONTHS NEEDS HELP MENTALLY ASAP WITH A LESSON IN HISTORY AND SCIENCE.üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
0	Yea its rare but I'm thinking twice about the vaccine now. 36 reported cases of thrombocytopenia by early feb21. When and if it occurs to someone it's devastating
1	Given a 5% chance of death with COVID, 1 in a million to have non-lethal blood clots with this vaccine is well worth the risk.
0	Super spread coming. Good luck people who got the shot. You are the super spreaders
1	Please vaccinate!!! Do you part,and save lives and protect love ones!!! JUST DO IT !!! So we can move on!!!!!
0	Covid19 survival rate - 99.7% Covid19 vaccine zombification rate - 99.7%
1	Try to avoid the vaccine at all cost, because it‚Äôs not FDA approved and could be bad in the near future
0	Am not taking vaccine neither any of my kids taking that shit that's my law
0	In summary:. People that know the truth are not getting the vaccine.
1	I did a thing today. So should you.
1	I have a fear of needles and have had many over the years . This was the easiest & by far. Done & dusted so quickly.
0	Big shoutout to everyone else who also hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccinated
1	This is astonishing stuff.  There is always some good that comes out of a shitty situation and I think the good that we will get from this pandemic is the advancement of pharmaceutical technologies. This could lead to the cures of so many diseases in the future including cancer!
0	@CoachMBullis The thing is, everyone has their own reasons for getting vaccinated or not getting vaccinated. Same reason I don‚Äôt get a flu shot. And I respect everyone‚Äôs decisions on why or why not. It has absolutely nothing to do with politics, at least not for me.
1	It is WAY more effective than no vaccine!
0	Do not trust these people because they tell lies!
0	Make sure your life insurance covers you if you were apart of a experimental trial! Some will not pay out!
1	These magats on twitter are saying they‚Äôll never sleep with someone who gets the vaccine and I‚Äôm just over here being incredibly thankful for the amazing surprise side effect!
1	Healthy people taking the vaccine allows for people with compromized immune systems to live normal lives. Stop beeing so selfish people!
1	Scientists and government safety experts. It was tested like other vaccines.
0	I, too, am a registered nurse who has done extensive reading and will not be getting the vaccine.
0	Not taking any vaccine might save your life.
1	Had covid in October, had the vaccine last week, slept for a day straight and woke up with a gnarly headache üíÄ even so it was literally a hundred times better than having covid lol
1	Majority of Antivax people that I‚Äôve seen believe that there are alien microbes that can cause cancer in the vaccines... let that sink in
0	vaccine has medical ethics problem
1	Experiments prove that vaccines can work
0	Before vaccination: risk of infection After vaccination: infected. Great way to speed up the process. Let‚Äôs all go get infected shall we! Said no one EVER.
1	One of the worlds most valuable commodities‚Äù.... it‚Äôs a life saving vaccine. the value is on the LIVES SAVED. profiting off of health care is demonic.
0	Politicians making laws to protect Billionaire Pharmaceutical companies, instead of We the People.
0	It was the vaccine.   We know he died from the vaccine!
1	It can be painful but worth it
0	Well the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent people from getting covid or spreading it. plus if you care to notice ... the more people get vaccinated with these experimental vaccines. the higher the variant cases get ! Welcome to year #2 of 2 weeks to flatten the curve. all for a virus they are telling you will be like any other annoying childhood illness
1	I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one.
0	I'm woke, I refuse the vaccine.
1	Just got shot #2 yesterday. I‚Äôm doing my part. Are you?
1	I just want to thank you and all of the people who worked so hard to develop the Covid vaccine. I got my first dose on Friday. My only reaction was a slightly sore arm at the injection site. THANK YOU !!!
1	I'm waiting until I can get the Pfizer vaccine and when I can get the second dose within the effectiveness window.
0	already had covid wasnt even bad no thanks.
0	Just a reminder of who owns the patent to this virus and its supposed cure. No liability for permanent harm, death, infertility or long term effects. No test. They say you need it every 6 months and still need to wear a mask......tell me another lie.
1	I actually think the Covid vaccine should be mandatory. When I was a kid all students were given tuberculous vaccines in school. Why? Because it was a contagious deadly disease and a risk to public health. No debate. You took the shot. This should be no different.
1	Canadian here. I joined a fb Covid Survivors group to learn about their experiences having contracted the virus. That's all it took for me to decide to get the vaccine!
0	I‚Äôm not taking this crap. People dying of blood clots and heart attacks.
1	Got my J&J yestersay, 24 hours later and I'm feeling a bit heavy-headed and sore and will likely feel pretty meh for the next day or so. Having gotten covid late last year I can 100% say this is way, way less bad, even though I had a very mild case of covid! And I'll finally be able to see my parents again after almost a year now that we'll all be vaccinated :)
0	My mother told me not to get vaccinated, she hasnt done it, me and my wife or kids hasn't done it either. I have a bad feeling about this vaccine
0	I have always been armed with th cure just incase my fam or i gets it. I dont need the jab at all.
0	All drugs/vaccines go through this process. Initially they are safe, effective wonder drugs. Then after months/years/too often decades drug/vaccine found to be ineffective, dangerous, eventually withdrawn/banned. I have described it as 'The Ages of Drugs'
0	My body, my choice.
0	Screw that vaccine ,it can end life because its poison,I know a few that were in there 8's that died right after.
1	I heard it claimed the COVID vaccine didn't fall under the legal definition of a vaccine. Is there any truth to this?
0	Do we know what's in the flu vaccine? But most still have it muppets!!
0	Numerous people have already died from this vaccine and the corrupt agencies will never admit it.
0	I will NOT .i will be homeless and or Starve,Never Been Anti Vax Before But No way No how will i take this Posion,
1	Bring it on I'm up 4 it
1	I have been jabbed with Astra Zeneca no problems with side effects so far.

1	I mean it's the same with any vaccine so I'll take it right away
0	3 of my family members just died after taking the vaccine!!!  The vaccine is nothing but a bioweapon people!
0	The 'experts' have been bought off. This is NOT a vaccine, it is a barely untested dna altering operating system. The 'news' has a lot to answer for.
1	Doing this is going to cause so much more harm than the possible side effect ever could. You‚Äôre eroding public trust in the vaccine & removing a valuable tool for fighting a deadly disease. Plus, at least where I live, vaccines are hard to get as it is.
1	Thank you to our amazing scientists, global partners, health officials, vaccine production workers Secretary Azar, VP Pence, and President Trump. An amazing accomplishment.
1	bruhhh the vaccine made my ass bigger I swear
0	I need no vaccine I'm healthy enough.
0	Trust your amazing immune system, don't take the jab.
0	The V is pure poison!!! This guy must work for the pharmaceutical companies!!!
0	Heavier period, bloodclots, heart attacks, or death... am I missing anything? https://t.co/EphRnGnjTE
1	Thank you so much for accepting me into this group. I had my first Pfizer vaccine last Friday, and look forward to doing a few more things thanks to medical science!
1	lolwhut? why are you suggesting people will get covid19 from the vaccine? the vaccine doesn't cause the disease. not only that, but trials so far have shown 94% of those vaccinated are immune to the disease, and 0% of those vaccinated get severe symptoms if they are one of the 6% who aren't immune. do you understand?
0	"with an abundance of caution"  Right... an abundance of caution would have been not to vaccinate people with experimental ingredients.
1	lady: it killed my aunt, my uncle, my friends bUt iM nOt aFrAiD oF iT
0	I won‚Äôt be getting it because they are pushing it on people, something doesn‚Äôt sound right about it.
0	Anyone else heard about females being sterilized by the vaccine?
0	Its that same people calling everybody Nazis yet demanding that we all carry our "papers".
1	Vaccines worked so well in eradicating certain diseases people forgot how horrible those diseases were
1	In my area a couple years ago, a pediatric nurse was intentionally screwing up lots of kids standard vaccines. She was fired, of course. But many kids had to redo a bunch of shots. There's crazy idiots everywhere
1	I got my first Moderna yesterday. No other symptoms other than a very sore deltoid. The flu vaccine I had back in October last year made my entire arm sore for 3 days, plus gave me flu-like symptoms the next day. So far, the first shot of Moderna has been incredibly mild the first 24 hours. I can't wait for my second shot in 4 weeks!
0	My sister took the vaccine and she feels like she is going to die from the endless side effect that it contains and the amount that she experienced since getting vaccinated. She has already fainted and felt nausea a day after she took the vaccine.
1	There's so many scaredy cat people who don't want to get the vaccine. It's a piece of cake. Plus you won't be a spreader and get sick. Man up and do it
0	lol still dont plan on taking the vaccine.
0	Anyone saying they're anxious to get it especially online, is working for big pharma or trolling for government. The government can't fully control you if they don't get you hooked on these jabs. Ask yourself if you made it through 2020 till now and the stats are showing the Rona is leveling out why are you getting it for a thing in which is still mutating? Do you notice how there is no mention by government of taking care of yourself by eating right, and taking vitamins
0	Got my second shot a week ago. I promise you I won't ever get another covid vaccine. Cause the last shot made a huge knot in my arm and a huge bruise. Alot of pain.
1	My dad just got his vaccine! I am so relieved for him.      I‚Äôm also super proud of him. He‚Äôs surrounded by a lot of people who refuse to get it and who believe COVID is a hoax. So his decision was controversial - but he did the right thing. Go papa!
0	I want to add I did have the Covid virus in Dec 2020, but it was mild, actually I felt worse after just receiving my first vaccination shot.
1	I‚Äôm getting the vaccine tomorrow
1	The world is over populated already,they want to kill us all using the vaccine while taking money at the same time.
1	The vaccine should be mandatory for travel.
0	Take a Virus and inject into your vein.That is not safe.Proof:Soreness,fever,fatique and death were seen and recorded in many participants.6 people died in Pfizer vaccine trials.So,when will your body stop producing anti-bodies? or will it continue,like a car without brakes?One person side effects is TOO MANY.
1	Scientists should be earning more than sports men. They're the real heroes.
0	I am safe. thinking you are not safe lowers your immune system. an experimental mRNA vaccine is not the answer. how about finding out how many people will take it b4 investing. should you be able to invest in health? seems kinda wrong. mandatory vaccines is tyranny.
1	I'm not afraid at all since I'm vaccinated. I'm being cautious because I don't want to be an asymptomatic spreader. I think it's great that people are being considerate.
1	I am very glad that my parents aren‚Äôt idiots and knew to vaccinate me
1	I am 75 years old and had 5 excuses for not getting the vaccine. Some were previous health conditions. But yesterday I said what the hell and got the vaccine. I saw all the videos on the pros and cons of all the videos no matter the source. I had zero side effects and zero pain and hardly noticed that anything even happened. No pain, no side effects. Here in Canada, they are slow in getting the second dose. Here the wait for Pfizer is 4 months and not 21 days. Many young people who are still being forced to go to classes are complaining that they cannot get the vaccine and that nobody wears masks in school. Maybe this varies by the school.
0	It's a poison not a vaccine
1	It shouldn't give anyone pause about whether the vaccine is safe or not
1	I'm looking forward to finding out how the Moderna vaccine does. It was the only vaccine in my area. My husband who is a healthcare worker got the Phizer vaccine at work so that makes me feel better for him. I assume Moderna will be similar as they are both mRNA

0	Because they are all equally useless. Except for giving you strokes.
1	Point is: Let's do everything we can to prevent OUR spreading the virus to others. Masking, social distancing, washing hands often and vaccinating. Let's all do the right thing.
1	I got Johnson & Johnson vaccine two days ago. I am feeling better today! Two night ago and yesterday I had muscle pain, chills, fiver and very bad headache! I am glad today I am feeling good!
1	Had my vaccine this afternoon - it was Moderna - brand new this week - not often I‚Äôm an early adopter!
1	Just got my second dose & everything he said is true. Sore arm and little headaches but that's it. It's a small price to pay to stay alive and healthy
0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I‚Äôve never heard such nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccinate people who aren‚Äôt at risk from a disease.
1	I get round one in about 7 hours of the pfizer shot. This makes me really happy
0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it üëç

0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
1	I just got my second dose of Moderna Thursday!! 8 out of 9 of my coworkers who also got the second dose (either moderna or pfizer) had fever, chills, brain fog, muscle aches, and some intense sweating that lasted 24-48 hours. All in all it's better than putting ourselves and our elderly patients at risk! If anything I feel more confident in my protection against covid because I had such an immune reaction.
1	Grateful and relieved. #vaxxed
1	If I had to choose between being vaccinated or the possibility of getting the virus, then I choose vaccination!
0	If the vaccine is a choice,this whole bs is so contradictory and unethical!
0	Covid 19 is man made= it has a patent= u can patent naturally occurring viruses= FACT... research before u poison yourselves
0	You guys skipped the step where the consumer researches everything and gains their own knowledge on what they'll be consuming instead of talking to a "medical professional." Look up the ingredients and what they do and consider whether you really need to take unnecessary drugs if you're a healthy individual with a strong immune system and you haven't gotten the virus yet.

1	I'm confident in the development process of the vaccines today.
1	My wife and I got our first shot Tuesday. It was such a relief.
0	The vaccine had problems from the start and they have been understating the numbers. Johnson and Johnson should have never released this vaccine. The actions of this company along with the FDA demonstrate negligent behavior and now there is a cover-up.

0	I don‚Äôt plan on getting vaccinated.
1	Tested positive this morning. My wife did last week. We‚Äôd absolutely still get it.
1	I still got mumps as an adult even with vaccinations but it was pretty minor. Even if they aren't 100% effective they give your immune system a chance to fight back if you do catch it.
0	People are posting their vaccs experiences, all happy about getting fever, chills body aches and saying "Oh, yay! Its working!" MEANWHILE, these were all the symptoms of Covid that they were screaming they're gonna die from! Not to mention they can't reflect back on a year and realise they've been perfectly fine yet go and willingly get injected with a vaccs that is considered 'in clinical trials until 2023'. The absurdity is astounding.

1	#WashingtonState go get your #vaccine!
0	just wait to get covid19 if you are in good health. seriously. the vaccine is for people with bad health, are old, or haven't had covid 19.
0	Im still aint taking it
0	You can keep all of them
0	What's the use of 90% efficacy when you can't get your manhood up six months later?
0	No way in hell am I getting this vaccine.
0	I know how I'll end. up if I take that vaccine. exactly like the aliens in my videos. they're called J-rods and they're humans from the future.  so no, thanks, I ain't taking the vaccine
1	Scotty? ScoooooOOOOOtty? Where the bloody hell are ya mate? I want my COVID vaccination. How do I get it? When do I get it? What vaccination will it be?
1	Vaccines can also protect people who can't receive them
0	Died in car crash after testing positive for covid = covid death  Died minutes after taking vaccine = death completely unrelated to vaccine  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
0	Former Pfizer Vice President Warns of Dangerous Vaccine Testing Fraud https://t.co/OIeDo58HUH Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine studies are based on FRAUD and put lives in danger, warns former Pfizer vice president! For People who dont like 2 watch Videos!
0	@mw_leslie @nypost Not getting a vaccine because of propaganda is the epitome of being programmed and falling in line. You morons are amazing. ü§£
1	Hurry up get the vaccine NOW
1	Got my first shot today and can't wait for the second.
0	it is funny we live in a free world but we are forced to take a western medicine even if we are not sick or we don't need
0	Yep of course you don't need the oldies you want to eliminate them as they are no longer productive!!! Murderers!!!!
0	@know_ure_rights I‚Äôve been harassed by everyone to get vaccinated.  I knew it would be tainted and it is!  Screw the murderers Bush, Clinton and Obama and their propaganda !
1	Got mine, shot #2 next Tuesday.
0	Not accept the vaccine due to safety concerns.
0	Definitely not.
1	Give me that shot! Make it a double!
1	I can‚Äôt wait to get this vaccine. Thanks, science!
1	India's vaccination campaign leading by example, 2 million doses in 11 days üáÆüá≥üôè
1	I intend to do this as well ASAP. My family lives in New York and they're all vaccinated.
1	Yes . Take the shots because the government says it good for you. Take the shots. The government knows exactly what you want and need. Do what they say and get used to to government control.
0	I think we can all agree that giving up our bodily autonomy to heartless corporations and elected officials is a bad idea.
1	Guys don‚Äôt worry, natural selection will do his thing at some point
0	The word covid 19 and vaccines makes me vomit
1	Every vaccine protects virtually 100% against serious illness, hospitalization and death!
1	With each shot that goes into someone's arm, we get closer to the end of this pandemic.
0	It's not a vaccine it's an e xperimental biological mRNA gene therapy that will alter you, wake up people !!!!
0	A vaccine for a reasonably healthy person with a 99.7% covid survival rate.. Seems a bit pointless to me.
1	take the vaccine and everything turns back to normal. if you refuse then we will be in this forever. think about others!
0	I do not dare to take the vaccine at all
0	Poison
0	Because they have started to wake up and feel inner strength...........No way any government can stop this.
1	antivaxxers disliking an informative/educational video about a life saving vaccine smh
0	I say no. If they can't answer questions about it, no, we should not take it.
0	I will die before I‚Äôm forced to get jabbed. I refuse to put that poison in my body!!
1	I will let my immune system which has been developing for thousands of years fight this. With 99.8% odds, I will take that bet every time!
1	A vaccine in less than a year. I'm damn impressed.
0	The mark of the beast
1	I have been pro vax my entire life and I have only had the flu once and that was when I was a 6 year old who didnt care about getting sick after that I got more serious I nearly never got sick and when I did it was just some cold that lasted a day and all I had to do was to just not touch stuff and if you want to say "well you cant say anti vax dosent work since you have always been vaccinated" I knew a person that was not vaccinated because his parents wouldn't let them get vaccinated (we were 14) and they got the flu every 2 months and had to miss about 3 days of school everytime sometimes they would get it twice in a months during flu season so obviously anti vax doesn't work  TLDR; I'm pro vax and I've only gotten the flu once while an old friend has gotten it many times
1	"Half million people have died" what else prove you guys need to get vaccinated?? "
1	I know a guy who was vaccinated once, next day - hit by a bus, killed instantly, coincidence? BaN VAcCinATIonS!
0	They want to Gene edit the human race. Mark my words
1	Can't wait to get it.
0	The thrust from gaits and the powerful elite is reason enough to NOT get poked.
1	Please take it for gods sake
0	F your vaccines. Were not all brain washed people.
1	The Covid-19 vaccine are safe. The second shot can make you feel like you have a 24 hour bug but then you're fine.
0	Long term effects aren't even discovered yet. Way to risky with such a vaccine with ''emergency use only'' status. Besides everyone under 65 rather get covid than a vaccine. Unless ofcourse if they have health issues that would make covid dangerous.
0	Well mainstream media ain't to be trusted that's for starters
0	I wasn‚Äôt anti vax, saved countless lives they‚Äôre brilliant. However, thanks to the government‚Äôs campaign to coerce me into having the vaccine unnecessarily, I am now sceptical of all vaccines. Thanks.
0	STAY AWAY FROM VACCINES.
1	In Russia, during the same time, several variants of the vaccine were created and all without side effects. But I think that you would rather kill your citizens than acknowledge the effectiveness of the Russian vaccine.
1	In other words, the vaccines are massively successful and doing what they're supposed to do.
0	Their messing with dna the can destoroy the wey u look ?
0	Vaccine them to death yes
0	Might get COVID-19 from the vaccine.
1	Coronavirus is still a threat in our lives and our last option us youth is to be vaccinated against coronavirus in order to be coronavirus free
0	yes they mutate when the population is immune so we were immune , so why did we need this vaccine.
0	Give her the vaccine. She already looks dead. Sick people
1	I‚Äôm pro-vaccine because when people don‚Äôt vaccinate themselves and their children it increases the risks of them and others getting the disease.
1	the amount of antivax friends i have is ASTOUNDING!! and i had no clue!!
1	of course ... we should take the vaccine and feel safe! who refuse to take it is our enemy. god bless bill gates, he is a really nice man
1	Got my first shot today as well. Excited for some sense of normalcy in the near future
1	I just feel bad for small percentage people who can't get the vaccine or doesn't work for them. I had a teacher who got the chicken pox vaccine but her body doesn't make the right antibody's for it. She relies on everyone else being vaccinated for her safety.
0	Two words ‚ÄúTuskegee experiment!‚Äú  Four more words ‚ÄúMark of the BEAST!‚Äù
0	Italy are going to jail bill gates I hope once this starts they all get jailed and forced to have the death jab
0	The vaccine distribution is uneven.
0	They go for this vaccine because they think its safe and because they're made to think that they need it! I know ppl that want it even after i explain what's in it and the side effects! I've been called selfish because i wont have it and I'm putting others at risk!
1	I have both shots of Pfizer. All good no problems.
0	Stick your vaccine where the sun don't shine.
1	If antivaxxers do not take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
0	These jabs are not needed not safe not ethical, prove otherwise and kindly stop referring too PCR results as infections, cases or a clinical diagnosis
0	Nobody dropping dead in the street Nightngale hospitals never used, number of deaths  and cases fiddled...cases means nothing. Just a bad flu from which 99.7 % of ppl recover. #CoronaBollocks
0	The vaccine will probably give me the chills and headache and nausea
1	Pro vaccination: a doctor, a nurse, a teacher Anti: a podcaster, a stay at home mom, a "lover of life" That should've been your first clue right there
0	You can trust big pharma. Even though they got immunity from lawsuits and the head of phizer sold off 5 million in stocks. Lmao
0	the shot just killed a friend of mine ,the first one made him feel bad and the second one killed him . severe side effects are going unreported to keep people getting the shots .Clovis Fikes was his name .
1	remember folks, the symptoms of illness, the aches, pains, fever, etc. That's your immune system working, that isn't the virus itself making you feel that way, that's your body's defenses kicking on and a sign that it's taking the threat against you seriously.
1	I am VERY grateful for the vaccines, but will forever be cautious, at least until the youngest of children are protected.
1	Just divert a small fraction of the military funding to fight this virus with tests and tracing and we could prevent far many more deaths to our citizens than whatever we are spending that money on.
1	If any medical personnel feel unsure about getting it, HMU, Ill take your spot!
0	Vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability! ! ! Think About THAT!
0	sounds like they're just wasting our money on a vaccine that nobody wants
0	It's not even a vaccine, it's gene therapy.
0	246 fully vaccinated residents in Michigan just tested positive.  Seems to be working good.
1	Wow, this is amazing. I'm looking forward to getting the mRNA vaccine!
0	I dont believe in the vaccine They did this al to fast, normally it takes years to get a vaccine, this is totally nit okay,
1	the vaccine should be mandatory
1	I have autism and I was not vaccinated as a kid. Because my mum was worried about it causing autism.
1	I want to sign all 4 of my kids up for the trial. They are all healthy and active.
0	Annual shots?!?! No surprise there especially when it comes to Big Pharma....I'll rely on my antibodies and hope my body is going to keep me from harms way.
1	I had Covid in early December. Today, April 5th, I got my first Psizer vaccine.
1	Its gonna be great watching the graphs of continued infections and when the vaccine hits seeing those rates start to fall.¬† Then the real fun will start with the anti vaxxers doing everything they can to explain away why rates start to fall as soon as the vaxx hits.
0	I have my ice coffee in the mornings, I'm all set
0	That is until they fine you for refusing or decide not to serve you. I can't afford that :( It's masks today, vaccines tomorrow. We are royally fucked.
1	@jerzey11011 You didn't have all this anti vaccine nonsense either. We came together globally to irradicate smallpox. You need cooperation.
0	Won‚Äôt be getting it don‚Äôt trust it they was too quick making it
1	I just got a tetanus shot, and the spot bruised a bit, but other than that it was fine. ...have no doubt it was effective‚Ä¶
1	Got my two shots...feel great!!!
0	WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BRAINS OF THE VACCINATED.
1	thank you all at MedCram - super helpful all the time and comforting in arming us with knowledge
0	1. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúvaccine.‚Äù And 2. This experimental drug doesn‚Äôt stop the spread of the virus.
0	It‚Äôs amazing 100k people have potentially died from the Covid vaccine and they just keep giving it out.
1	the vaccine should be mandatory
1	Measles isn‚Äôt something to joke about. Please vaccinate.
1	My whole family has taken the vaccine and we are all fine. It was worth it for us because we saw what happened to family and friend that got CV19.
0	The kill shot
1	I always vacccinate
0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1	This was great - thanks for uploading. Would love to see a simplified breakdown of the components and mechanisms of all the vaccines currently (and soon to be) in distribution worldwide. I think once people understand what's going on inside the vaccines, it would help quell any underlying fears they might have.
1	I have a friend whose continuing shortness of breath, almost a year post-COVID, improved immensely after the vaccine.
0	I‚Äôm scared of the vaccine because a lower percentage of ppl have had rlly bad effects on it
0	those are GENE THERAPIES not vaccines . No way im gonna take it
1	I'm not sure it's possible to change the minds of those who are extremely skeptical of the vaccine at this point.  Perhaps Mississippi should focus on getting a high ratio of younger, potentially more open-minded people to get the vaccine, instead of spending time trying to convince older individuals that the vaccine's benefits outweigh the risks.  This strategy will indirectly benefit those skeptical older individuals by significantly slowing the spread of the virus in both young and old people.  This rationale made me rush to get the vaccine as soon as I could: While I can't convince some of my older relatives to get the vaccine, I can at least make sure I'm vaccinated and therefore they won't get COVID from me
1	After taking vaccine, there were no side effects affecting normal life.
1	Protective measures and vaccination should go in parallel to fight this virus. Hope people understand that we should act together during this pandemic, before it is going to be too late.
1	Believing in science is a good thing
0	Sensible people will continue to live their lives without taking the jab.
1	I‚Äôm getting my second dose next monday! I‚Äôm so excited!!! I haven‚Äôt had any colateral effects after the first dose
1	Well said! I‚Äôm a school nurse and got the COVID 19 vaccine 11 days ago with no reservations. I‚Äôm working hard to keep my students and staff safe.
0	Big deals. It's likely to be as toxic as AZ, Moderna, Pfizer and the chinese crap. BIG DEAL!!!
0	I Trust William Cooper's Book \" Behold the Pale Horse \" ! Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars !
0	I'll be one of your challenges. I respectfully decline your offer of medical treatment. Thank you.
0	Oh lord. At least they‚Äôre not rushing to get their babies vaccinated for a shot not FDA approved yet
1	That's their choice. Get the vaccine and protect yourself. Whoever chooses not to can live with the risk.
1	The vaccines are 100% effective against death.
0	I will NEVER take this Satanic poison, in shah Allah!
0	I haven't changed anything with how I live since covid. I don't use a mask. I don't distance. I have felt completely fine. I'm not living in fear.
1	Received my first dose of Moderna 11 days ago. Woke up covered in full body rashes yesterday. Although I am super grateful to receive the vaccine and 100% for it, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this side affect. Was in the ER again this morning. Hoping I can still get the second dose, but a little terrified with having this strong side affect from the first dose.
0	Fck yalls comments bout anti vaxers yall gay im never takin that shiii
0	A vaccine that nobody is held accountable if I develop a reaction or die? Yeah, no thanks
1	Once there was no vaccine, people complained about how the government not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. Then we heard the vaccine was coming, then people started complaining about how it's taking too long. Then the vaccine reach and dissemination started, then people started complaining about the nurses not wearing any gloves. Some of you people are real jokers who will complain and disagree about whether the sky is blue and water is in the sea.
1	There's a difference between strong immune system and healthy immune system. Strong will kill you healthy will not
0	Gently tell them: "it's not about you". I'm vaccinated for myself, but more for my mom who is 92 and everyone I come in contact with.
0	Even if it's safe and works, its still my choice not to have it.  I've never had flu jab and never had the flu
1	Life is a risk. Risk if you take the shot and risk if you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs right to decide which they are more comfortable with. We did the first Pfizer last week. Time will tell if that is as the right decision but for us now, I think it is.
1	Anything above 90% is an A+. So A+ you scientists!
1	I‚Äôm getting my vaccination today!
1	After going through the last 11 days I would hands down take the vaccine immediately to prevent what I just went through.
1	I reckon the vaccine is safer than those pills people were/are popping in Ibiza though. Doesn't stop them popping them though. ;-)
1	I got covid last July/August and I lost all ability to taste/smell & about 2 weeks ago I FINALLY was able to taste/smell. Pleading face it was the absolute worst experience ever!  It‚Äôs not 100% bt something is somethin #FckCovid #Vaccinate
0	side effects is enough, that should be telling you NOT TO TAKE THIS FARKING poison.  this is nothing but fear,  good little boys and girls.  Bollocks! NO FING way
1	Thanks for the vaccine, amazing snd dedicated team at moderna. Science rocks! Btw- no issues for me with either dose of the moderna vaccine!
1	We received our Pfizer vaccine yesterday. A heartfelt gratitude to everyone who works at Pfizer and BioNtech - you are literally saving the world. I know so many of you worked so hard and continue to work tirelessly. My gratitude is immeasurable. Thank you!
1	Yay we need that vaccine in Ohio too!
1	My girlfriend and I just got out first Moderna shots last night!
0	My body my choice! I ain't taking that garbage and risk getting bell's palsy!
0	States are removing healthy unvaccinated kids from school. Healthy Kids who have not been injected with Hep B are out. Kids with actual Hep B stay in. If the healthy kid gets actual Hep B, they can go back in & are protected by confidentiality. Still think it‚Äôs about health?
0	I‚Äôm not getting the shot
1	Just got home from filming and was blessed to be able to recieve my first #vaccine shot!
1	I am so pleased to know that the world is getting the vaccines we all need. Thank you unicef.
0	No vaccnine,I am naturally immune to flu
1	Got my 2nd dose of #corona #vaccine today. Urge everyone to get vaccinated when their turn comes. And remember, the rules don‚Äôt change even after vaccination - keep the mask on & maintain social distancing.
1	Even people under 30 are better off taking the vaccine vs the chance of Covid.
0	Vaccination is biggest lethal weapon.
0	You dont need vaccine to survive CoVid...you need it for compliance.
1	I will start vaccinating people in my practice next week, I might cry a little tear of happiness...
1	Statistically speaking it's impossible for the vaccine to 100% prevent hospitalization/death
1	You should be glad for vaccines. Imagine smallpox came back?
0	I will never get vaxed. My body, my choice
1	Just mail me my vaccine, like voting. I don't want to stand in line. I'll take it myself.
1	I‚Äôm so happy that we‚Äôre getting back to normal, ain‚Äôt seen my family in 13 months, let‚Äôs fucking go planet earth
0	Many people get hurt by medications. I was hurt very badly by a Pfizer medication. The one thing I have learned in this is that you have absolutely no voice. Nobody wants to hear about it. No doctors no media, nobody.
0	>Person has covid, has heart attack, then dies: death from covid >Person has vaccine, has heart attack, then dies: death from heart attack You‚Äôve got to wise up to their ways and stop accepting this bullshit! Call them out!! Get vocal!!!
0	You can take my vaccine! I'll be treating myself with self isolation, lemsip and bedrest!
1	It sure will be. I get my 1st vaccine shot at 12:45. I am so excited. Stay safe and take care of each other.
1	Just got my first one today!
1	I rather have a small shot than having to stay quarantined another year
0	vaccination is making patients die
0	I wonder what caused the new strain of Covid..
1	Just got my second dose & everything he said is true. Sore arm and little headaches but that's it. It's a small price to pay to stay alive and healthy
0	This days the government cannot be trusted because if you have fever or flue they will just say you have covid...
1	COVID-19 vaccines are precisely what we need ASAP to safely get our lives back.
0	Having a strong immune system, not being obses, and taking care of your health is the best way to protect yourself from covid not Vaccine .
0	Side effects include Bell‚Äôs palsy, rash, diarrhea, sensitivity to 5G, and erections lasting more than 4 hours
0	No thanks! U can keep that poison for you and your family's. Mine wants nothing to do with it.
0	how can the government or media ever gain trust. they are a joke
0	Yes thank you I'm an antivaxer, I have the right to choose
0	"Benefits outweigh the risk?" A heart bypass sure but a virus with 90% survival rate? Dammm
1	I heard many of our people in UK, reject to take Vaccines.We in Somaliland are knocking every door  and searching any favouritism at any cost to have one.Please don't lose this chance.Yes death is at he hands of Allah, but to give yourself due care, is Allah's order. #TakeVaccine
1	I'm fine with another shot if that what it takes.
0	in 5 years it will also be known to be very dangerous as well
1	Vaccines are a public health thing, not a government control thing. People urging you to get vaccines are doctors and medical professionals, not politicians.
0	Keep your vaccine to yourself buddy!!!! Not needed
0	Good luck being test person
1	I would heavily advise you to get the vaccine but I can't force you to. Furthermore, you will probably lose your job if you work directly with people, so as not to put others at risk. Regardless, please reconsider and if I can help in anyway provide some comfort or information to persuade you, please let me know.
0	Why have a vaccine for a virus that 99.8% of the population will survive? It‚Äôs about control.
0	What?   The population is just genuine pigs for all kinds of experiments - no accountability.
1	I got my COVID vaccine yesterday. The only side effects is day dreaming of how awesome spring is gonna be.
1	My girlfriend is one of those shots getting her first dose. The last person in my life, outside of two anti vaxxers unfortunately, to begin their vaccination regiment. It will be nice to start seeing everyone again soon.
1	WE HAVE A CURE PEOPLE WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
1	Again, VERY VERY HAPPY I GOT THE VACCINE, LOVE ME SOME VACCINATION, but whoooo boy, last night was ROUGH. That second shot does NOT play, and I'm very glad I'd already put stuff in motion to take today off completely.
1	I agree with you. The UK Govt initially distanced themselves from the Russian vaccine, it now seems its efficacy is somewhat higher than the AZ vaccine. Mabey we should have placed orders with the Sputnik vaccine.
1	I trust Pfizer üôè
0	Canada won‚Äôt cancel Johnson & Johnson vaccine contract despite safety concerns
0	The vaccine has MRC-5 in it which is "lung tissue of a 14-week-old aborted Caucasian male fetus." THIS IS FACT!! DO YOUR RESEARCH!!
1	I'm glad I got the Pfizer vaccine over Johnson & Johnson.
0	Question..... Many Americans are running out to get the bogus Corona Vaccine, so when the next bio weapon is released will those same people be getting the next experiment vaccine too??
0	The so called virus is just being used as a vector for the all important toxic vaccine.
0	I love how there‚Äôs an entire marketing campaign to ‚Äúother‚Äù people just for being skeptical and erring on the side of caution with their HEALTH. Ironic.
1	I don‚Äôt have an issue getting a booster
0	Do Not Take Vaccine for Covid 19 to many unknowns all vaccines are not equal
0	Yes thank you I'm an antivaxer, I have the right to choose
0	Pfizer CEO still hasn't taken the shot himself. That's highly suspicious. That's like the Nike CEO refusing to wear Nike's.
1	Herd-immunity is the only way to fight the virus, take the vaccine
0	I feel so bad for all the people who are being duped into taking this
1	We‚Äôre just thankful that we in our 90s and 60s got our 2 shots of Moderna last February and we‚Äôre alive and well and look forward to gathering with our fully vaccinated family and friends in the next few months without masks
0	Can you explain zero liability from these mega corporation,s? while I can face jail if i drive down the road without insurance.
1	Why would I take a vaccine that was rushed to the public with hardly any testing and now they are saying it‚Äôs only good for 6 months. I‚Äôll take my chances on a 99% survival rate if I get it!!!
1	My very good friend died yesterday he was 48yo a care worker and leaves a wife who is a nurse and a wonderful daughter behind. Please please take the vaccine when available.
1	I wish I had the Hepatitis B vaccine before I almost died and spent the rest of my life on an antiviral.
1	I'm a teacher. Im an anti vaxer
0	1 Month later: All are dead. There is heavy metal in the doses. Whether they admit it or not.
1	vaccines ARE a cure for the pandemic in society as a whole
0	Pfizer has a history of falsifying data how can anyone trust them after that.
0	We need a "vaccination" /protection against Corporate Fraud, Treason and Lies, not against the scamdemic virus.
1	Over 18,000 Jamaicans vaccinated in one day is excellent! #Vaccinate
1	You‚Äôre. Also I‚Äôd rather take any long term vaccine effects than face possible lung scarring.
0	I have my essential oils so I'm good.
1	come and bring your vaccines to florida.. NOW
0	I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY VACCINE AGAINST MY WILL. And this one particular is still in clinical trials!!! These people are lab rats!!! Fight! Fight! Fight!!
1	I hear Utah hopefully doesn't have any rules around who they vaccinate (in state vs out of state). Everyone should get it
0	Vaccines destroy you dna
1	Let those who don't want the vaccine or don't think it's necessary suffer. It's called natural selection.
1	It is like a new filter or flu shot. Take one every 6 months. nobody complains about those.
0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract????
1	Just got the vaccine yesterday and the only complaint I have is that my left shoulder feels like I took a punch from Mike Tyson other than that I'm good and I have allergies so get it everyone!
1	Fuck y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm getting that shit as soon as possible so I can go butt chug some beers with my friends!
0	Did he say the vaccine is good and it works?  ü§£ü§£ü§£
0	They have blood clots in their brain?! It‚Äôs a NO for me.
1	I'm scheduled to be vaccinated on thursday. I work in a covid unit and see the devastation of this virus, so I'm really excited it's finally here. I've been keeping up with the science because, like anyone, I don't want to roll up my sleeve to something that isn't safe. I feel confident in this vaccine. mRNA vaccines have been studied for over a decade. The reason this one was developed quickly is because the whole world was throwing money at this project. It's amazing what can be accomplished with such a huge collective effort. Roll up those sleeves, America. Let's save a life and get back to something more normal.
1	lol planning on getting the vaccine
0	A common sense question: If #vaccine can‚Äôt stop #COV19 why keep pushing it? Who get the interests from universal vaccination?Why Highly vaccinated countries are not see obvious improvement on pandemic? There always a political excuse that blames on 0.01% people who not vaccines.
0	I have a tent, i know where the woods are. Good luck making me put your toxins in me.
0	Not enough money in the world to make me get a  corona virus vaccine.
1	Had my first #vaccination this morning. I felt so relieved and so grateful that I thought I might cry. I've always loved both science and the NHS, but perhaps never quite so much as over the past year. There really is light at the end of the tunnel for us now, isn't there.
1	Just found out today that both my parents are FINALLY getting their first #COVIDVaccine shot at the end of April!
1	For goodness sake you people be thankful for all the work done to get us this vaccine, people a lot cleverer than you
1	I got the second dose two days ago. Yesterday, had to call off from work because I was so extremely tired and had a bad headache, spent most of the day sleeping. Today, woke up fresh as a daisy. Isn't that better than two weeks in isolation with Covid, or possibly having to go to the hospital?
0	Hate needles üò©üò≠
1	we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
1	I'm a-ok with self isolation so I can probably hold off for a bit to make sure people who need it get one. I work from home and have introverted hobbies.
1	I have had the AZ vaccine with no problem and I am more than happy to have it again as a booster. Yes there have been issues although serious issues are minimal. Without AZ we would all still be in a lockdown with little to look forward to.
1	I heard the vaccine makes your dick grow an extra inch.
0	This is massive mind control taking place here. Yikes they are so desperate. All the dislikes too lmao üòÇ
1	Got my 2nd dose 15 days ago.feel great.!
1	When parents take sedative for their pain but not vaccine their children.
1	All the medicine has a risk of having allergy reactions. So why don‚Äôt you not give your kid medicine either.
0	These vaccines are going to do so much damage to individuals and cause many deaths people need to do research in to what is really going on here.BIG PICTURE
1	I got mine today at the local volunteer fire department. I made an appointment online and got the shot in my car. Took about 15 minutes.
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!\nüôÇüëç,
0	My skin is the red line in the sand. Attempt to cross it at your own peril
1	Just get the vaccine for gods sake
1	Ok great we are getting more vaccines and there working!!! WE WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL THIS SUMMER!!
0	Bite me! VACCINES ARE POISON!
0	My protection is the Lord Jesus Christ himself God did not have his hands in these vaccines I believe it in my heart and in my spirit God makes no mistakes!
0	Scamdemic
0	The whole plandemic was about fooling people onto these vaccination passports which is clearly a disguise for the social credit system. Absolutely reject these things even get rid of all smart equipment in your house if need be.
0	I'm not taking the vaccine even if it was mandatory and free.
1	Thank you lord amen üôèüèº,
0	Coming to terms with the fact that I have multiple children with v-ccine injuries and being called ‚ÄúANTI-VAXXER.‚ÄùI WISH I was one! Nope,instead I led my lambs to the slaughter. What is wrong with these vax extremists and their inability to process someone else‚Äôs truth?
0	Fr√•n m√•ndag vill de tv√•ngstesta barnen varje morgon och tvinga de att b√§ra munkorg hela skoldagen h√§r i Th√ºringen. V√•ra barn stannar hemma, och m√•nga andra g√∂r likadant. Ni kan dra √•t helvete med er coviddiktatur era j√§vla barnmisshandlare.
0	No one in our large extended family would take the experimental shot for a million dollars and we think money is nice.
1	Because of your advice and videos doctor I was able to convince my mom and father in law to take vaccine thanks doctor
0	If my employer requires me to have the shot, I will quit on the spot
1	I think the pollsters asked the wrong ten people. The British grew out of being lambs to the slaughter after WW1.
1	Had Astrazeneca 20 days ago. Was ill for 2 days (like a cold). I was told that most ppl get a fever in around 12 hrs and they hit the mark almost in a minute :D Cant wait for the second one to be done with it.
0	I‚Äôll pass
0	‚Ä¢ATTENTION¬∞ DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE IT WILL NOT HELP THIS IS A WARNING SOME PEOPLE IT WORKS ON SOME IT KILLS THEM THINK TWICE BE SAFE MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL üôè
1	I‚Äôd rather be autistic than an idiot‚Äù
0	Why don‚Äôt we talk about how they have never made a vaccine this quickly and how they have not tested it properly.
0	Most vaccines are safe . Myself and my children have just about every vaccine available . Covid vaccine is too new . Let the people who think it's safe get it . I'll wait and see what happens .
0	The COVID-19 pandemic can be eradicated without vaccination.
0	Many people are tested positive after taking covishield vaccine
1	Wow. Just wow. A few months ago it seemed like this will drag on for a very long time. Now look at this. Awesome. Science does wonders.
0	Drug company uses own study to promote own vaccine. Really good metric to go by. (SARCASM)
0	I have gotten several nudges to take the vaccine and I'm flat out refusing. No thank you, give it to someone who wants to risk their health.
0	Oh boy, 96% effective and lasts 6 months for a 99.9% survival rate virus, makes sense.
1	3 reasons to take a vaccine:  1: 2: 3:               haha jk jk     1: It helps your body fight off viruses; saying a virus will "naturally" go away is dumb.  2: You are less prone to becoming sick and dying.  3: You will be smart  2:
0	You are submitting to be a lab rat
1	I'm still alive and haven't became a 5g transmitter beacon so I guess that's a good thing...
0	Covid cured the flu if that doesn‚Äôt tell you covid is just a flu then stay asleep and take the population control shot, bill gates explained it really clear his agenda on vaccines on Ted talks!
0	SCARE TACTICS DIDN'T WORK, COVID-19 FAILED.,
1	Alternative title: Kurzgesagt politely roasting anti-vaxs in a nutshell.
1	You could look out the window. 100s of millions have been vaccinated. Very few issues.
0	Why should I risk the quick-to-market vaccine when others can do it for me and still get the benefits from the reduced transmission ratio?
0	Timeliness of the vaccine
1	Let's not be so hasty. I can see an opportunity here. Perhaps we should give all who don't want the vaccine, the benefit of the doubt. Let them not have the vaccine if they don't want it. üòÇ
1	it‚Äôs understandable to be worried about it, i think lot‚Äôs of people are iffy about it who normally wouldn‚Äôt be just because of the sheer speed of it.  But I really think it might help alleviate your worries if you read about the how‚Äôs and why‚Äôs of the speed of this vaccine. ‚ò∫Ô∏è and you‚Äôll see that they had quite the headstart anyway, they just needed the investment of the government to ramp up production, etc. The other thing that has helped, is the coverage of this virus, because it has resulted in a LOT of people taking part in the vaccine safety trials where they normally don‚Äôt have such numbers.  I hope that helps a little! ü•∞
0	The vaccine will not protect you from any virus in any way. Even the flu vaccine doesn't protect people from becoming infected wi
