0	When a vaccine is safe and effective you don‚Äôt need to promote it no?
1	Everybody that does not take the vaccine will die
0	Well I wont b takin vaccine coz i dont trust it
0	I have sickle cell anemia. I'm not taking the vaccine until they do study on people like me. I'm on vitamin D3 and liquid vitamin A - zink. My diet is all organic I don't eat fast food, I cook my meals.
1	I‚Äôm in the moderna clinical trial, so feel free to ask any Q about the vaccine.
1	I just got my 2nd Dose today! Let‚Äôs go
0	I am 24 and healthy going to wait to take it in case there are long term problems
0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job.....
0	The flu shot made me sick last time I got one. No vaccines for me.
0	I‚Äôm glad that they didn‚Äôt make it mandatory. No vaccins for us
0	If enough sheeple get the vaccine then that means I won't have to.
1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement
1	Nursing home I work at has had zero cases among staff or residents since the first round of vaccines. Just got our second round last week as well. Morale is way up and the results have caused some vaccine doubters among the staff to sign up for the next vaccine round in two weeks. Definitely light at the end of the tunnel
0	At what month or year after taking a vaccine  for Covid do you become sterile or your health deteriorates until death?   And by then nobody will question or even think about you being sterile or have died because of the vaccine you took a few months or years ago.   The pushers of the vaccines response?   In public, "we didnt know"   In private, "Mission accomplished"
1	I wish 7 billion were waiting for the vaccine. Smh anti vaxxers
0	I will NEVER take it, if you are vaccinated you are supposedly safe, so mind your business.
0	If I can't hold someone accountable for a product that can hurt me then I don't have to take it period dot.
1	Thanks UNICEF for your lovely effort to save the life of the universe
1	It‚Äôs weird how when a virus has a 3% chance of death, people go ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not that serious, the chance of you dying is only 3% why you taking it so seriously?‚Äù But when a vaccine has a 5% chance of either not working or has adverse side effects (not even a 5% chance of death, just side effects) people go ‚ÄúNO THE VACCINE BAD!! TOO DANGEROUS! I DONT TRUST IT!‚Äù
0	Id rather catch the virus with a 98% survival rate then get that poison vaccine
0	We don't want yur evil vaccines
0	Relatively new, experimental..... No, thanks, but no....
1	I‚Äôd like to see the venn diagram of C19 vaccine hesitancy and Trump support.
0	How about the deaths in Norway after vaccine?
0	We simply don't know about long term effects. There hasn't been enough time
1	I'm going to take it. I just want myself and family to be safe and alive, all that matters at this point.
1	Love this. Let's keep it up!
1	I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit.
0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine.
0	It's not a vaccine. It cannot be mandated. The immune system is more effective than any vaccine.. with no side effects. Healthy people are healthy people. They need no treatment. And get a better test as the PCR is not a valid diagnostic tool, according to the man who created it.
1	Sounds like a great vaccine I am excited about it. Since my children have asthma problems.
0	Did they actually made a pre fase testing on animals? Did they ever isolated the virus so that they can use RNA ie DNA? How do you explain so many sudden deaths after the vaccine? It seams that according to that those vaccines shouldn't pass the phase one. And last and not the least: is it possible that they lied about those results you are mentioning?
0	It's poison. Wake up America. I don't get any vaccinations and neither do my kids and we're are fine. They put stuff that kills you slowly
1	I mean talking about side effects just look at the ones for paracetamol which is effectively used in most of the world as far as I know
0	Don't take vaccines coz overpopulation is a problem.
0	Corona is fake and I won't be vaccinated
0	They like to tell us the reason for something is one thing when it really exists for a totally different reason. Like they say abortion gives women a choice but it‚Äôs really depopulation
1	1000000% the doctors nurses and health workers should be priority to vaccination without them we would fail against covid !
0	No thank you
1	Everyone who take the vaccine trails are HERO. Stay strong!
0	More doses of death juice in the vial. Problem solved. This guy's a genius!
1	Thank you so much for this video I'll be sleeping better tonight
0	I am NOT taking any vaccines related to Covid-19. As a matter of fact, I am not taking any more vaccines for as long as i am alive.
0	My question is, how is it acceptable that the virus vaccine had been discovered immediately and is not a threat to human life while HIV aids had been there for decades without a vaccine to immune rhe human body form HIV? ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èFear the evil behind such vaccine. ‚õî‚ùå

They have been driven into a state of morbid fear (of absolutely nothing) to the point where they will stand in line, in the middle of the night, to get injected with a human pesticide containing an IGR, just so this poison doesn't go bad. Pure Darwin at work here. These pussified sheep will make the ultimate contribution to the gene pool. They'll remove themselves from it.
1	#iamhere  to  thank  for sharing this information, in this difficult moment we are living, a complete and correct communication is essential. Vaccines have always helped humanity and will do so even now.
1	Its fine, let those anti vaxxers catch the whooping cough and see how they like it lol
0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it üëç
1	Thank you for this! Going to share! Dr Seema perfectly articulates what I explained to my family and friends who naturally have reservations about the vaccine.
0	I dont trust vaccines rushed, people will die regardless of what it offers.
1	My cousin is antivax and has had 3 children. All of them have autism.
0	I agree. Usually clinical trials take at least 9 years to gather robust safety data (observation for side effects) in a variety of various patient groups (elderly, children, pregnant women, patients with specific health conditions, etc.), but this vaccine as been rushed through by the health authorities and granted marketing authorisation (permission to be administered to patients) at such a breakneck speed, it is of a grave concern. That is why we do not need a similar situation as was seen in thalidomide.
1	"No amount of evidence will ever persuade an idiot‚Äù
1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
1	Man, my friends and I cant wait to all get together for a post vaccination party.
0	I find it very amusing at the fact in every picture of health care workers getting vaccinated, we do not see the actual needle nor it going in. It has been revealed on numerous occasions, with the exact same discrepancies as this example. Propaganda at its finest.   all you want with those paid smiles, but you cannot deny nor hide the truth
0	NOOOOOO THANK YOU!!!!!!
1	ALL need to take it in order to save lives!!!!
1	And yet my mother is still convinced the vaccines are actively killing otherwise completely healthy people. I can‚Äôt fucking wait to get vaccinated and rub it in her face
1	So far all my grandparents, my mother in law, my step dad, 2 clinically vulnerable friends and my aunt and uncle have had the jab, which now is far more people than I know who‚Äôve had covid. To me that feels like we‚Äôre slowly winning.
1	Phizer. Just sore arm
0	If they offer the Vaccine to me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll give it to these guys and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have extra protection.
0	No vaccine for me ever! Cut my head off so I can be with Jesus Christ & God Almighty!!
0	UNICEF is the wing of yahudi. Do not believe in it. Why they participating in spreding fake corona vaccine.
0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
1	You don‚Äôt want the shot don‚Äôt get it, but the people who want it should have the option too. Don‚Äôt stop them it‚Äôs their right.
0	Thank You moderna got my first vaccine get my booster late this month.
0	Go to Life site News and listen to a Dr, informs you of that they are not telling us!
1	I got the vaccine, moderna one, and I was just very sleepy lol
0	LOL no just no couldn't pay me enough to get that shit
1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection. The technology is pretty good at replicating how viruses work, and that process itself isn't associated with any long term effects. There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization. I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
1	Getting mine Sunday morning after my 12 hr night shift in the COVID icu! Happy to be part of the solution!
1	It should be free once it is released, it is for the benefit of the society, not individuals.
1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with. Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure
0	I had a professor in med school who said ‚Äú Don‚Äôt ever be the first or the last to try a medication‚Äù. I‚Äôm planning on doing exactly that.
0	They are volunteering for vaccines for getting off loans... We know where we failed
0	Covid programs allowed on youtube still...hmmmm....sooo, this is the "information" they want us to believe....
1	I don't want to get COVID!
1	Who would have ever thought that the end of the human race will be at the hand of idiotic conspiracy theorists?
0	Why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you mention the nanoparticles/aluminum in the Phizer and Moderna vaccine.
0	We do not know whether the vaccine will prevent infection and protect against onward transmission.
1	Brother just got his second dose today and my SIL gets hers later this week. Just wish I could get the jab but I get to wait a bit longer.
0	I sure as heck am NOT taking that thing
0	Second shot is making people sick!
1	Yep. Lost my grandfather a few days ago to covid. I hope people can get this vaccine soon so no one has to deal with this any longer.
0	The only one getting immunity is the manufacturer.
0	Wow. Pfisor makes their own study.. aren't responsible for harm...and the ones making money on it. How dumb do people have to be to believe these Demon's.
1	When the vaccine is available, I will get it as soon as possible because I believe in the science behind it and believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
1	To everyone who's afraid of microchip tracking through vaccines, wait till you find out about cellphones and social security numbers.
0	My mom has said that she doesn‚Äôt want to take the COVID 19 vaccine. She says this is because the vaccine has ‚Äúkilled almost everyone who took it‚Äù.
1	I'm definitely more scared of covid and would do it yearly if I had to.
1	Hoping for pfizers vaccine, but I'm happy to take any of them
1	when i was 5, i tripped and fell. I do not walk now to prevent myself from tripping, join me and levitate everywhere. Make sure your kids levitate too or they might trip
0	2:09 there are √¢‚Ç¨ÀúCURRENTLY√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ no reasons to be concerned about the vaccination.... I rest my case.
0	What people don't understand is that Western Medicine is built for profits not cures. Just imagine if every disease and illness known to man is cured. How will these pharmaceutical, CDC and FDA make their money??? So remember this when you go to a doctor or deal with insurance companies or medication all of this are made for profits only. No one ever in the history of medicine talks about boosting the immune system the frontline to fighting off bacteria and viruses. These drugs that put out in the markets are designed purposely to have side effects to keep you depending on Western Medicine.
0	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it @ this time.
0	Take an unproven vaccine whose manufacturers won't even take responsibility for bad outcomes, to avoid the sniffles? Nope.
0	If your agents ever show up on my property with a "vaccine", I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget.
1	Thank you for your enormous work, so difficult in this moment. Vaccination is an act of civilization. We have to take care of each other. #iamhere
0	I will never take that vaccine hell no people are dying from this vaccine I don't care what anyone says
1	TOGETHER WE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19
0	It‚Äôs not anti vaccines it‚Äôs that we have woke the hell up to your plans
0	C'mon man! Now...here's the deal... The doc died from the vaccine. CASE CLOSED!
1	watin for the vaccine, definately getting it
0	The virus isn't deadly enough, let's make a deadlier vaccine.
1	Vaccine manufacturers are given protection because extremely rare (less than 1:1,000,000) side effects don‚Äôt outweigh the overall good that vaccines do but would bankrupt any pharmaceutical company that made them through civil suits
1	FIRE them for being stupid. Unless you have a history of severe allergies and anaphylaxis you should be getting the vaccine. These people will go straight to hell for their selfishness and putting other at risk.
0	i dont want your bloody vaccine
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me
1	COVID-19 : I Love Infecting And Killing People Vaccine : IM GOING TO END THIS VIRUSES CARRER

1	Wow a lot of anti vaxxers in the comment. I can't wait to get my second shot soon!
0	I'll never take your Covid shot!!!!
0	The Great Reset or do they mean the great culling don't forget your vaccine folks.  OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE.   (These pricks will kill you.) If we cannot see the big picture by now (agenda21)  what hope have we got?   Good luck everyone.
0	Do not take vaccine, don't listen to fauci aka dr fraud.
1	I would feel like a complete fucking scum if the earth, if I found I accidentally spread the virus and someone died because of my inaction.
1	got my second dose last week no sideeffects. Feels great!!
0	This is my body I am not cattle on a farm to be I injected by a public health official that views me as a HERD of infectios wild animal
1	I just had my first dose today and have no side effects what so ever and I never felt the needle go in either
1	No, they're not. These vaccines went through the exact same process that any other drug goes through. It went faster because the vaccines had top priority and were able to jump the line ahead of every other drug the FDA was evaluating. In other words, no steps in proving effectiveness or safety were skipped. These same mullets who are saying they don't trust the vaccine are the same ones that demand we "listen to the science". Oh the irony.
1	Many health agencies across the globe have found the vaccine to be safe. The benefits of the vaccine are not only preventing infection for yourself (thus preventing your own death and long term health effects from covid), but also should include slowing the spread of covid and preventing you from transmitting it others.
0	Just passing this on  I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me:   First of all, up until this point there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. [1] In preliminary animal trials for previous coronavirus vaccines (SARS and MERS), animals were vaccinated and seemed to exhibit a robust antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe organ inflammation (especially in lungs), and they died. [2][3] Paradoxical immune response in coronavirus vaccines has also taken place in human trials, which occurred during testing of the failed RSV vaccines of the 1950s. [4] Alarmingly, there are some statistical indications of ADE in covid vaccine trials, but there is no way to know for sure because many key signifiers of ADE weren‚Äôt specifically addressed. [5] Due to emergency protocol, the usual method of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed, limited animal testing occurred in parallel with humans, and the potential for ADE was not comprehensively assessed. [6] [7] Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years from now when vaccinated persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or genetically similar versions of coronavirus. [8]   Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are ‚ÄúPEGylated‚Äù, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol).[9] PEGs can lead to life threatening anaphylaxis or other conditions such as thrombocytopenia. [10] [50] Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. [11] Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune disorders. [12] These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs [13][14][15], yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. [16] Also, there is some worrying evidence to suggest that PEGs cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, possibly causing inflammation and/or autoimmune conditions, a fact gleaned from previous animal studies on mRNA vaccines. PEGs were found to be distributed across a spectrum of tissues including the brain. [52] Additionally, nanoparticles (such as PEGylated hydrogel) are known components for state of the art medical interventions, including biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa Inc. [17][18][19][20][21] The secretive nature of this technology necessitates a knowledge gap between developers and the general public, so although my research efforts have yet to verify a direct functional relationship between PEGylated nanoparticles used in covid vaccines and biosurveillance, I personally do not relish the prospect of being injected with such given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex.   Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. [22] Vaccines should be tested for multiple years to adequately assess their longterm effects. [23] Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves. [24]   Fourth, the efficacy number of 90% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna is statistically misleading, reporting a relative reduction instead of absolute reduction of risk*. Also, the trials only assessed these vaccines‚Äô ability to prevent mild symptoms and NOT their ability to prevent transmission. [25] If they don‚Äôt prevent people from transmitting the virus (especially when safer, cheaper drugs like Ivermectin do) [26] [27] what‚Äôs the point?   Fifth, these are NOT vaccines in the normal sense. They are mRNA vaccines, which utilize a completely different process for achieving disease protection**; mRNA vaccines seek to introduce messenger RNA into the body in order to ‚Äútrick‚Äù cells into producing immunogens, which then stimulate an immune response. [28] These vaccines are the first of their kind ever to gain authorization. [29] Current vaccinations are essentially an extension of phase 3 of the trials. [30] Because of the lack of long term safety assessment and the new nature of this technology, people are participating in a mass human experiment with no way of knowing the long term health effects these could cause. Many problems from vaccines are known to have an incubatory period and do not manifest until much later, which is why testing needs to occur for multiple years in order to adequately assess risk. [31] One such problem currently being discussed is the mRNA technology‚Äôs possible impact on female fertility, as it encourages the production of antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that contains a very similar protein crucial for the development of placenta called syncytin-1. This could interfere with the reproductive process by encouraging the immune system to react against syncytin-1, thereby disrupting placental development. [32] The vaccines‚Äô impact on fertility is currently unknown as animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. [33]   Sixth, there was a signature for many different problems seen in the various trials and initial rollout for these vaccines, problems that are concurrent with commonly documented vaccine injuries. Injuries that did occur in the various trials/rollout have included, but are not limited to, anaphylaxis, Bell‚Äôs palsy, transverse myelitis, multi-system inflammatory syndrome, encephalomyelitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and death. [34] [35] [36] [37] [50] [51]   Seventh, and perhaps most importantly, the movement toward potential vaccine mandates or other coercive policies violates humanity‚Äôs most universally accepted principles of human rights and medical ethics, especially for a medical intervention with so many known and unknown safety/efficacy concerns. The absolute bedrock of medical ethics is the right to informed consent, as individuals must be made fully aware of all the potential benefits and risks associated with a medical intervention, while still maintaining the right to decline that intervention should they so choose. [41] Mandates or coercive measures fundamentally violate historical safeguards humanity has put in place to protect us from the ever present threat of medical tyranny, including the Nuremberg Code, the United Nations‚Äô International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and UNESCO‚Äôs Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. [42] [43] [49] Such would also be in violation of the Hippocratic Oath, for not only do oath keepers pledge first to do no harm, but also to treat the needs of the patient. [44] This implies that a doctor‚Äôs duty primarily pertains to the needs of the individual before the needs of the collective, a vital distinction made by Hippocrates and understood for nearly 2 millennia. [45] [46] Privileging the needs of the collective is a ‚Äúfallacy of misplaced concreteness‚Äù. [47] While individual need is directly apprehensible and consensual, collective need is an abstract, subjective concept not easily defined. And yet who usually gets to define this concept? Such is most often defined by those in power with the most means to influence institutional narratives, turning medical professionals who treat the needs of the collective according to this definition into mere extensions of that power at the expense of individual informed consent.
0	Vaccines are part of an agenda the elites created for depopulation they‚Äôre killing our babies with these ‚Äúsafe‚Äù vaccines.

1	Anti vaxxers are misinforming ignorant people. I trust science and would definitely get the vaccine.
0	Never never never
1	I don‚Äôt get flu shots never have. I will get covid vaccine since it does not require annual shots.
1	‚Äôm willing to get a vaccine when it‚Äôs my turn, but as a healthy adult, it says there are 268.7 million people ahead of me.
0	Anyone here can have my share....Cheers
0	Dont get that bullcrap vaccine near my kids
0	This has not been engineered to stop by vaccine!

0	This commercial has been brought to you by Pharma Inc.
0	MODERNA has violent side effects.
1	Vaccines need to be a law.
1	I took Pfizer yesterday am fatigued and Have chills am Glad I took off today bc I wouldn't have been able to go to work but other than that am fine arm a Lil sore which is to be expected
0	No vaccine for aids, cancer, but in one year y'all have vaccine for covid ü§£ü§£ naw I'm good
0	Hell no .They couldn't pay me to take it.
1	I vaccinate because I'm not retarded.
1	Smart man! We need 70% of the population to be vaccinated in order to stop this pandemic in its tracks. Let‚Äôs do this people! Everyone wants to go back to normal!
1	Anti Vaxxers should pay for their medical costs if they contact Covid-19
0	As for me and my household, we shall not take this V.
0	Still not getting THIS vaccine and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m no anti-vaxxer at all.
0	I got mine yesterday My arm hurts and I feel like I have the flu.
0	That‚Äôll be the Nano technology in your system changing your DNA bruv. good luck to you
1	My elderly mom got her 1st shot yesterday and is doing well..was the mederna brand
1	Vaxxed
0	I just want to see it be used a bit more and see the effects it has before I take it.
1	That is great news. This man is a world treasure.
0	Thx 4 sharing. It helps. I always wondered all that'.
0	NO THEY ARE NOT SAFE!!!! And the W.H.O know this already.
0	Give me 50 grand ill take it otherwise no
1	If the top professionals in health care are having it, then it's good enough for me too
0	I‚Äôm not your guinea pig, maybe you are but I‚Äôm not.
0	How about inside the lab that created covid-19
1	I‚Äôll receive vaccination. Healthy medical person should be a early adopter or pioneer in Japan. Let‚Äôs save the world!
0	Keep up the good work! You have prevented COUNTLESS children from being another vaccine injury story. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!
0	I'm not taking anything I have to sign a waiver on.
0	I won't be taking any covid test, or vaccine and will be encouraging others not to. I haven't worn a mask or washed my hands since the scandemic began and yet here I am fit as a fiddle with my vegan diet. Men who dig pits for others will fall in it themselves.
1	This just proves how much technology has progressed. Vaccines usually take years to devolve and require live samples and now it can be produced with a genetic code on a computer screen.
0	Medical "scientists" , don't know how most Rx drugs work - they have theories about pathways being blocked or opened but not MUCh more.....That's why once an RX drug is FDA approved and then the awful effects unwanted start maiming people THAT's when it gets taken OFF the experiment on people/market...
1	If this vaccine comes out, I'm gonna be the first in line to get it. It is gonna be as refreshing as waking up from a nightmare
0	Would rather have the virus then go anywhere near the vaccine, never trust a jobsworth
1	Looks in antivaxxers head:nope no sign of a brain
0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it
1	I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
0	Why do I need it if my body fights it off naturally.
1	What a relief. My mother received her first dose on Saturday. She is 70, with COPD, and she has hunkered down for this entire pandemic. To think that, once the vaccine does its job, she can survive this virus as if it were a cold? Well, it is simply a huge relief.
1	Absolutely yes. If there were substantial negative side effects we‚Äôd have seen them by now. That‚Äôs what such extensive trials are for.
1	will help to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19
0	My mother died of covid one week ago 5 or 6 days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine...i will never take it
0	I'm anti government, anti system, anti a lot of things, not anti vax. But in this particular case, i'm not taking the vaccine. I don't want things to go "back to normal". I want things to become better. So this is my form of protest kind of (i'm in Germany)
0	I‚Äôve already recovered from covid and we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll throw our immune system into overdrive from it
1	WTF antivaxxers youre crazy
0	I won‚Äôt be having a rushed vaccine, perhaps when they understand the side effects and that won‚Äôt be for quite a while yet.
1	Her being against vaccines because she had a bad reaction, is like someone say is against exercise and is bad for you, because she sprained her ankle once.
0	When the government says safe and effective so many times I know I should run for the hill
0	I don‚Äôt mind to be the last person on earth to take the vaccine
1	We take Vaccines and medicines so we dont die at 50 like they did 200 years ago. Its not rocket science
1	So we apparently know nothing about this virus yet weve managed to develeop a "vaccine" in 9 months
0	I WOULD RATHER LIVE ON A CYBER DUMP THAN TAKE THIS
0	The work you are doing is incredible and you've helped create probably the most powerful movement on the truth about vaccines. Well done to you all. Keep it up and more and more people will awaken to the lies and deception.
1	Order aside, I just wish they'd accelerate things. On a per capita basis we're roughly 30th of 50 states. Embarrassing, and unacceptable.
0	I, a New York citizen, Stand in total agreement with the Californians! üíØ% No poison for me! üôÖüèæ‚ôÄ
1	I wish there was a way to make being antivax punishable by death. That is the only thing that can stop them.
0	DON'T GET THE VACCINE My friend got covid and recovered in just a few days. Nothing super significant about that right? Wrong! He has CF (cystic fibrosis) which is a major issue with the lungs. Research says that people with pre-existing diseases WILL die if they get covid. Like I said, he was fine. He told me it was nothing more than an intense flu. In just a few days, he got over it. One last thing, HE DID NOT HAVE THE VACCINE. Besides, do people really know what is actually in this Vaccine? This could be the easiest way ever that whoever made these "vaccines" take over the world. All they would need to have done is put some sort of devise in with the vaccine that enables them to access the brain, and ta da, they take over. (Just sayin.)
0	side effects, just like covid symptoms hahaha.
0	The guy said mRNA have not been relatively used before, actually mRNA vaccines have never been used before covid
1	Had Trudeau done this last May instead of pandering to the likes of Chi*a we would have our own vaccines by now and able to sell or give to other countries.
1	We can‚Äôt put in to words how excited we were to give 97 year-old Facey patient Ruth Zamora the first dose of vaccine at our newly opened vaccination clinic in Mission Hills this morning.
0	These doctors are eugenicists. Psycopaths.
0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. Tendentious in my right ankle. But never again for me.
0	Nothing beats a strong immune system. There is no money in it.
1	If not enough people vaccinate, then there doesn't form an immunity for everyone.
0	One word: "NEVER"
1	Grateful to receive my first dose of the Vaccine!
0	Thalidomide was said to be safe My mother was offered it but refused.
0	My mom got transverse myelitis from a flu shot.. it has ruined her life...
0	Dont care how you make it look like I'm not taking it until a year or so. Wait for others to be the test dummies.
1	I hope Pfizer can match the expected production. Would be nice to have 100 million doses per month.
1	It varies a lot by socio-economic status and race. FWIW, I don‚Äôt know any anti-vaxxers either.
1	It would be great if the city had more appt. only vaccine clinics vs. the mass vaccination clinics without appointments. Most people are working and can't wait around for hours to get the vaccine. An appt. would allow people to schedule time off from work to get their vaccine.
1	I don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù so long as I‚Äôm protected against COVID. If others want to reject vaccination, they can please themselves. I‚Äôll be getting vaccinated.
0	The Large drug companies are already asking for indemnity against prosecution against future unintended side effects of any C19 vaccine , very confidence inspiring that is !
1	Mayors, governors, the President, etc. should be vaccinated immediately. Regardless of their political beliefs its critical that the people running our governments are healthy and on the job. Remember what happened when Trump got sick? The Government went into free fall and there was serious concerns about who was making critical decisions. You don't want that even on a state or local level.
1	i would love you not to vaccinate your kids if you do have one, so there would be less retards like you in this planet bcs they died at the young age
1	I'm unaware of any anti vaxxers I know IRL, I am however aware of people who do not want to get the covid vaccine, though I think they have been coming around on it lately.
0	Whoever wants mine can have it I don‚Äôt want or need it if I die from it my blood is on the democrats they brought this crap to the United States to steal our election
1	Goes right along with Qanon and election fraud. The land of the ill informed.
1	Take the vaccine live for the gang √∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø
1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high.
0	Give it to the pigs first.
0	Vaccines will go down as the biggest fraud in medical history in 20 years
0	They can have mine. I am a Senior an don't plan to use one.
0	No vaccine for me.
1	There is a lag Between getting #Covid19vaccination & Protection. Vaccine protects most, but not all infection. Vaccines don‚Äôt work Retroactively. Certain Variants could be less Susceptible to vaccines. Vaccines prevent disease but not all infection.
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
0	üòêIts gonna be a NO for me.
1	mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or üß¨ code.
0	WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON COVID-19 VACCINE? IT WAS READY AT THE SAME TIME OF PFIZER VACCINE.
0	My body, my choice.
0	More than 20 people vaccinated with the pfizer vaccine died in Norway.
1	I read all these anti-vax comments and I think to myself: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
1	A miracle.
1	Doctors have the Effective Covid-19 vaccine the Pandemic Comes to an End June 2021!
0	Y‚Äôall finna turn into zombies
0	Nope. My children will not have it. There is zero research about how children will react to it.
0	Take fresh herbs they are all antiviral and stop worrying..The reason they wish so many vaccinated is to eliminate the control group. Yes, I do believe we can improve our immune systems functions of working to protect us. I just disagree with the methods used and imposed upon us. Vaccinations are toxic by their ingredients and cause an inflammatory response and in some cases can knock the immune system well off kilter. Building health with fresh herbs that are antimicrobial and antiviral, antibacterial etc, has no such issues. Mother nature has all the kindness, mans science has all the cut burn and poison. Which many of us now are trying to recover from.
1	Update. I‚Äôm 5 days post first injection all is well
1	I'ma take it
0	What about the ingredients? Never hear about them. No thank you!
0	Let the Sheeple get the vaccine, its going to be interesting watching the results. We are going to sit back and see what happens to these people after getting the vaccine.
1	If you have allergies to vaccines dont get them but dont prevent others from getting them.
1	Poison..no.i will NOT GET IT
0	Angelo Me too I'm not having this poison in my body just to be a rat on a wheel
0	You can have mine, I‚Äôll pass!
1	I just got my vaccine yesterday. My body feels so heavy especially my left arm.
1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine
0	Id like to know the death tole from these vaccines a year from now
0	I've been surrounded by people with Covid & I have not yet got it. Meaning I'm immune... Why the hell would I want this type of vaccine.
1	There are 1.1 billion anti-vaxers according to plague inc, so if that is true, it proves human stupidity.
0	Can your next video be about the vaccine deaths that have been covered up??? √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö Smiling during your video just makes you appear even more evil than lining your pockets to sell out your integrity.
1	People, just get the vaccine, it will save you and everyone else around you, please for the love of god
0	Interesting how the vaccine and rise in cases and they predict a rise as more in the next couple of months ...hmmmn..sound a little more than telling that they are not safe
0	thats like saying- shoot me in the head first- and i will take notes afterward...
1	Please correct me if I'm wrong but, when you have an R of 2.5, you would only need 60% of the people vaccinated/immune to get it down to R=1 right?  So we don't need 100% vaccination to get the R below 1.  Anyone knows what the R-value of Covid-19 is without any social distancing?
1	Gotta love a bunch of random people just saying that this has been proven, that one dude was wearing a doctor's uniform so he must have done rigourous scientific research
1	Guys I can‚Äôt thank you enough, I didn‚Äôt know it was just a little peace of the virus.  Now I feel saver to get it.
0	HELL NO I WOULD NOT TAKE IT
0	Wonder how much Pfizer payed that ginger lad to hype it up
1	Anti vaxxers should be put on a list and denied medical help when they contract COVID ! Simple
0	You can't pay me to take it
1	Please everyone. Take the vaccine to flatten the curve everyone its serious
1	That means, Coronavirus will end soon!
1	How about we actually get a vaccine before we start worrying about what yahoos won‚Äôt take it.
0	We've only just started vaccinating and people are dying already from the jabs , what the heck is going on , why isn't the MSM reporting this
1	Plot twist: Coronavirus was created to get rid of Antivaxers
0	POISONED BY VACCINE very common Unbelief of the concept it was done on purpose by the manufacturer
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me. I was sick for 6 months
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far.
0	No, don‚Äôt trust that shit at all
1	Perhaps I am an optimist as it is too early to tell - but there is something.. unusual happening with the hospitalization data. Cases continue to rise (and positivity rates in most places as well, so it's not just more testing) but hospitalizations have started to inflect.
0	NWO BOTTOM LINE!!!
1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
0	I'm not Anti-Vax but I do not trust this vaccine and would prefer to wait a few before taking it. I don't trust this vaccine at all.
1	Anti-Vaxxers are crazy. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. Even vaccines that effects you higher than the average will be protecting a person from that disease.
0	the vaccine is made by man and man is not perfect. how can we expect that it will be perfect and free of any side effects
1	mRNA does not alter your genetics and this method of developing vaccines has been studied for over a decade now.
0	I'm not gonna take the vaccine
1	This was so valuable!!  Thank you for this.
1	I am so excited to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
1	Or they attempt to go on an aeroplane and discover the airline, or other country, won't let them enter without vaccination.
1	Fantastic news! Best headline I‚Äôve read in a long time. Let‚Äôs hope we can get them distributed to the front line workers and elderly fast!
0	My only issue with taking it is whether it‚Äôs safe. Has safety been compromised due to the rush to get it out.
1	It's the beginning of the end, boys! I know this might've been said tens of thousands of times but for a pandemic virus we knew nothing about in January, a working vaccine being shipped 11 months later is a truly extraordinary feat.
0	I think that we should wait, atleast three years, to see the results, in the long term, of the vaccine.
1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high. if enough people are vaccinated then the anti vaxxers will be fine because of herd immunity but if no one gets vaccinated, they will all be seriously ill and die at a younger age.
1	I'll take the vaccine. Wish I didn't have to wait til summer. But I'll get it no matter what.
1	I got my Covid vaccination this morning. Such a sense of relief and gratitude to the NHS and scientists who made it happen.
1	My mom didn‚Äôt get my vaccine very often and I always got sick, but recently she became full antivaxx that I now have to rely on my dad to help me get my vaccine. So antivaxx moms can say oh props to your mom, shut up, I recently got the flu because I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine it was horrible don‚Äôt put your kid through it!!!
1	Got the vaccine. No side effects at all!
1	I challenge all anti vaxers to go to a covid ward with no protection and take a deep breath near a covid patient.
0	NOPE Never gonna take your rushed poison for a cold with a 99.8% survival rate.
0	Something tells me this "survey" was asked to about 6 people.
1	First dose taken. Never felt better <3
0	10% out of 43000 got the virus AFTER the vaccine? That‚Äôs 4300 people that got the virus. I don‚Äôt like those odds..
0	Why has no other RNA vaccine ever been approved.
1	I am in the Moderna Phase 3 Cove Study Trial. I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic. This Coronavirus Pandemic. Needs to be something of the past and we need to move forward with our lives. Thank you to all volunteers and participants of all clinical trials and to all doctors and nurses. Thank you for this very well instructed video regards to such a sensitive topic!
1	I am pro vaccination but these companies really do have Fallout series style names...
1	Covid - Kills 1 in 50 people (2% mortality rate) Vaccine - Has side effects in fewer than 1 in a million people (Less than 0.000001%)
0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out..
1	Anti vaxxers: "There is no proof of the virus" People and medical workers who've died from the virus:ok I guess
1	Than what explanation is for those children who received vaccines and are fine? That some vaccines are tainted? And the lucky children had an untainted vaccine?
0	We won't know what the long term effects are for at least a year or longer from this being widely distributed. It's perfectly sensible to not rush to take a newly developed vaccine - and to reserve it for those who have a priority need for it.
0	Nope
0	What about the man that died from it right after getting it today in the media idk if it happened today or yeaterday n he wasnt old that I know of
0	MEDICAL TYRANNY not allowed to say no to poison
1	I also heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
0	Plenty of vaccinations don't provide immunity ;only a false sense of safety.....Most people with ACQUIRED immunity are better at not getting the disease again.
1	Those at risk from previously eliminated disease (eg Infants, Elderley and those with suppressed immune systems) are at risk of death - and the Anti-Vaxx movement are complicit in this for weakening our species' herd immunity.
1	I'm a pro-vaxxer!
0	Last time I had a vaccine, my body shut down on me I ended up in an icu for 3 months with organ failure! NO VACCINE FOR ME!
1	I won't have to wear a mask soon ask i have taken the vaccine!
0	Sounds like one is playing the Russian rulet when choosing to take the vaccine
1	Proud to say that i got #Vaccinated against #Covid19
1	Just when you think there's a little bit of light  re. Covid vaccine..Dad had his yesterday Fab! Mum due to receive hers today... postponed
0	My whole family don't use vaccine until it's been used and successful in short my fam doesn't want to take vaccines that are literally just made
1	But my coworkers say that the vaccines still have the same death rate as the virus. First off I dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths. Second where do these people get their "information "?
1	I got my vaccine this past Friday. It went really well!
1	23 million people already have it in the uk with zero symptoms and are perfectly fine
1	I think the legitimacy of the vaccine is very promising.
0	A lot of health care professionals have said they are going to wait a year.
0	Ppp have died and passed out from that vaccine shjt i just knew it before ir happened by studying how currupted yall united states country always going to continue to bees if they befn dojn for decades they definitely not stop in or slowing down they gotta Tribble movie plan and dey fonba make sure nothing gets in they ways
0	rushed to market mRNA vaccines may do more harm than good.
1	Yes because getting Covid19 is not option me
1	I will be getting it to promote herd immunity and protect those that cannot get the vaccine, and I would love to travel internationally again!
1	The worst thing will be that those people will say "look i didn't get vaccinated and I'm totally fine, this vaccine is useless"
0	So, we are being used as Guinea pigs.
0	The only one getting immunity is Pfizer.
1	Vaccination is freedom, guys.
1	Vaccination only works when enough people do it. GET VACCINATED!!
1	If people would just take a totally safe vaccine then we would be so much safer
1	Bend over for big pharma everybody!
1	its over 90 % safe just take it already!!
1	I have had my vaccine and am very grateful looking forward to the second one now. Starting to feel safer. Thankyou.
0	The health department order is for you not to think too much about your personal self preservation against being injected with there poison for the greater good of EXPERTS
1	There's no "Pro-vaccine" There's just "Anti-vaccine" and normal people
1	The weapon to end the war...
0	i‚Äôm not taking anything that changes my DNA smd
0	You can push it day and night, not taking it. :)
1	we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them
1	It's acceptable to have a healthy dose of skepticism for anything, however I trust the doctors, researchers, and everyone who had hands on developing this more than a random tin-foil hat wearing youtuber saying it'll turn me into a gay frog.
0	If immunity lasts few months after a covid illness, how do we know that an individual's immunity after this vaccine will sustain longer?
1	When filling out the registration forms for the drive thru vaccination sites, is it necessary to fill out the reason for the appointment? I really want to get this done as fast as possible.
1	My hospital gets our first batch next week and I‚Äôll probably get vaccinated in 2 weeks. Stoked. Hopefully no side effects.
1	About time. I can‚Äôt wait for this nightmare to be over.
1	I cant wait to get to vaccine so life can get back to normal
0	No. They. Just want to kill us! This is not a joke!
1	Bless you WHO, I cant wait to take the vaccine
0	No thanks, you can keep your vaccine, we have an immune system for a reason.
0	I‚Äôm in UK and literally can‚Äôt understand why anyone in their right mind would want this vaccine. It‚Äôs had 5% of the normal testing time and you can‚Äôt sue if it goes wrong!!!! ??? !
1	For sure. I'm positive now and it freaking sucks. I couldn't eat without throwing up and just washing dishes feels like running a marathon.
1	Thank you I will take it
0	How on Earth most medical "professionals" can call all of these cases a coincidence is beyond me! It's a level of delusional I can't imagine.
0	Lady, you are lucky you don't live closer to me ... "we often get a sore arm ..." I got a little more than a sore arm!! I got permanent disability!! It's not anxiety. IT'S BAD NEWS THAT THEY HAVE A VACCINE THIS QUICKLY. DON'TN TRUST THE CDC - SEE "VAXXED" the movie if you want to see the CDC in action.
0	The mRNA in the vaccine tells the cells to create a protein that stops the fertility of the virus that will effect your fertility also you wont get kids,
0	The larger point is you don‚Äôt vaccinate people for a virus that kills .002%. Has a 99.997% survival rate. Clearly something else is going on. Clearly the vaccine isn‚Äôt safe.
0	If people in the health care field have reservations about this vaccine, that's all I need to know. I'd rather take my chances with a virus that has an over 99% survival rate.
1	I will take the vaccine because of solidarity reasons, i will do whats best for society as a whole.
0	I passed on the vaccine would rather take my chances on my natural immune system given to me by God.
0	Ever stay up late or work 3rd shift ? This vaccine reminds me of them late night ads that say ,If u have bleeding or black outside or leg falls off plz stop taking and consult ur primary doctor hahahahaha ,Ready for ur shot Sir? NEGATIVE :0
0	Are you guys going to make the rdif chip video too?
1	Imagine thinking you‚Äôre tough and ‚Äòfearless‚Äô for refusing medical treatment that could save your life or the life of your family members. These people‚Äôs brains are fucking warped.
1	Got the vaccine a week ago and i feel great :)
0	4:30 Is he just said "SAVE" AFTER 2 WEEKS of using it.... wow naughty....
0	It‚Äôs garbage. A scam for the taxpayer. It causes paralyzation and gonnorhea.
0	When you get injected by vaccine. You have no where to run from the 666 mark.
1	these anti vaccine people dont see the bigger picture.
1	We are excited to be a part of history, hoping to get back to our normal lifestyle and see everyone smile again!
0	A good mother always knows best. #Mama over big phrama.
0	Why do you trust these people, and you don't even know them personally they are trying to lower world population to five hundred million it is written on the Georgia Guidestones which is their mock ten commandments. They are using the vaccines for population control. Some people will have adverse reactions, and die.
1	Its all about herd immunity.
0	Let's say it like it is, forced vaccines = rape.
0	Something is NOT RIGHT about this vaccination crap
1	I made my appointment in advance waiting for high risk health issues to be eligible in my state and have been so eager to get it and protect myself
0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it.
1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide.
1	Only in America would people protest your getting a vaccine that would save your life.
1	Well I just caught Covid last week so I guess I have no choice but to wait for the vaccine now
1	BREAKING COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE - Russia‚Äôs Vaccine Is Safe and Effective, Published Study Shows
0	No To vaccination we know who is behind it...
0	wow wasted my time... never watching ABC again.
1	I'm tearing up that this is finally coming. It's been such a tough last 9 months here in the rural midwest where the majority of people don't take things seriously and then people die. Hopefully this is a sign that we're almost at the end.
1	You don't have to get the vaccine now, but it would be the smart thing to do.
1	the risks of getting covid outweigh the risks of the vaccine
0	All sheepeople line up first
1	Just got part 1 of my vaccine today it didn't feel any different from a flu shot. My arm is definitely more sore afterwards though. Literally just got it today so let's see how long that lasts.
0	My mom and brother are probably going to take it but im personally gonna wait a bit and see if people start having issues or not, if noone had issues sure i'll take it but if they do i'll wait a bit longer
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0	I hate to say it but this is starting to look like natural selection on a vast scale. Thousands of cars formed queues miles long and waited for hours to get vaccinated at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Hundreds of people tried to hand them leaflets with information about the "vaccine", it's ingredients and it's dangers. The sheep kept their car windows tightly closed. Just like little children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "Na-na-na-na". Those pamphlets could have saved their lives.
0	I'm not interested in how you feel now, I'm interested in how you are after 2-10 years with the vaccine in your body
1	I‚Äôm 33 and have been lucky enough to grow up with all 4 grandparents in my life. November 31st one of my grandpas died of COVID. Last week the other 3 went to the same place together and got dose 1 of the vaccine. I wish he had of been here just a little longer.
1	Yea I'm nervous too, for those exact reasons. But I'm probably going to get it ASAP. I'd rather roll the dice on a vaccine and its side effects instead of Covid and its side effects.
0	There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking this shit
0	I am scared because I never had it
0	Watching anything to do with vaccines never fails to make me cry!
1	Dumbasses who don't vaccinate literally put my life in danger.
1	I think we overestimate the amount of anti vaxxers. I think itsjust that they're the vocal minority so sometimes especially online it can appear that everyone is an anti vaxxer even though it isn't true
1	Medicine is good. Anti science is fraud.
1	Just because you have an adverse reaction to vaccines doesn‚Äôt mean nobody should get vaccines
0	I will never tamper with my bodies Natural functions by putting this crap inside me..id rather get the virus
0	How vaccines work? Sure, ... inject you with toxins that hurt you, and make you part of the list of people who may die from this covid that is searching for the right person?
1	Because her daughter can‚Äôt get vaccinated, she should be begging everyone else to get vaccinated.
1	Anti vax strikes back
0	Maybe I should do a survey in my town on  who was asked to do this so called survey probably zero.
1	Beginning of the end.... of the pandemic*
1	Seek medical advice and get vaccinated.
0	Phahk Fauci, Birx and all the t@ssers at the CDC and in Biden's charade. Oh, and his now new claim (after saying masks are not necessary) that wearing 2 or more masks is safer than wearing one.......YUCK FOU. Just wear the whole box already.
0	Can we inject all politicians and their children with the vaccine first? Then I'll trust it won't kill me
0	Trump said he won't take so I'm not taking it
0	There is no point by the end of 2020 we'll probably all be dead anyway √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
0	SAY NO TO CORONA VIRUS VACCINE
1	You can give mine to some stupid Democrat
1	I am lucky to have an appointment next week.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1	"Feelings are often immune to facts" I loved this statement, it's very true, Anti-Vaxxers would not accept, understand or comprehend Scientific and Statistic proofs, they just keep throwing misinformation and very weak arguments that do not make sense at all.
0	Yeah I'll get the vaccine in the next life R IP
1	Yes! I have taken the vaccine finally!!!
1	Vaccines aren't just for your health, they're for everyone else's too
0	Why not let politicians and celebrities take it first, since they're all so confident in it?
1	Hey so I decided to get the COVID vaccine yesterday I‚Äôm okay my arm is a little sore but it will go away but I feel great with no side effects
1	I‚Äôd rather have minor allergies than have polio
0	I would not see myself as a man if I put the vaccine in my childrens body
0	I think its all  a sick sick lie and the damn  mark of the beast in n a way people change this is u zee
1	I'm definitely taking it
0	I'm not going to get any sort of covid 19 vaccine ok! I REFUSE AND I COMPLETELY RESIST!!! I don't need this!
0	I'm so sorry for the families shattered by vaccine injuries. Thank you to these families who share their heartbreaks. You are saving so many lives!!!! Please people wake up.
0	The nurses at the hospital i work at that got the vaccination had to take days off of work from the side effects. Severe headaches, puking, feeling dead and lethargic
0	When it 'normally' takes between 10 to 15 years to develop such a vaccine and one miraculously comes out in a few months . . . . no wonder I'm sceptical! AND, to add further suspicion, the leading provider insists on the buyers signing a liability disclaimer . . . . what am I supposed to think?
0	My aunt took 2 doses of the vaccine and now she's really really sick. And then you see persons also dying, getting seizures and heart attacks. If they said it's a weakened form of the virus then how weaken is it?
1	Okay, I'll have an immunity while y'all fucks are dying around me.
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated!
1	I just got my second dose and no reaction to any dose whatsoever.
1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe
0	First you both inject this tasty mRNA vaccine, upload your video of both doses.
1	Been Covid positive twice already,have auto immune disease and had my first dose of covid jab! Hurrah! I'm still alive!
0	i just watched a video that said people can turn into a reptile after taking the vaccine
0	Even health officials are calling this political bullshit. The firefighters and medical professionals don't even wanna take this greedy death curse.
0	People are waking up to the fact that vaccine injury it‚Äôs way widespread than we thought!!
1	So a doctor on the new this morning said her second dose in the trial gave her "robust" response. I kind of chuckled at that description.  Usually when I get the flu shot, I feel bleh for a few hours, then I'm okay. My temp goes up, but not feverish, I get muscle aches and cold/hot. This time around I was on an immune system "cocktail" for a few weeks. when I got my flu shot I had no reaction except my sinuses seemed to clear up.  I wonder if there have been any studies if things like Vitamin B, C, D, zinc, etc might lessen the side effects.
1	We like the shot! üíâüíâ
1	I'm signed up for my first vaccine dose on Monday (I work at the hospital) and I was a little nervous. I feel a lot more prepared now!
1	Thank you, had my vaccination yesterday. I am one of many that appreciates what you are doing.
0	I wouldn't take any vaccine or any medication that was exempt from Criminal litigation as a result of damage to the recipient.
1	Yes. Definitely. The trials of the big ones look solid. I'm keen.
0	That effin vaccine killed my mother today. She was fine before getting it. Do not take it EVER
0	A Whole Load Of Bs
0	Soo......it is a test vaccin....:))) Go to Hell with this vaccin.....
0	nothing is safe from you or gates.
0	8/9 months to study, produce, test, market and inject the first RNA-based vaccine.  Innovative or experimental?
0	I just don't take vaccines that I don't need. There's plenty vaccines I haven't got and I won't get a vaccine cause it's the in risk now.
1	We‚Äôre definitely picking up speed now.
0	There is no way I‚Äôm taking a vaccine right away. I‚Äôm waiting at least a year to see what happens to y‚Äôall.
0	no way in hell would I take any of those vaccines... I'll take my 99% chance of survival with the covid. Those odds are good to me.
0	I'm surprised YouTube allowed this video, oh its bs no wonder
1	I think it shows the FDA panel is taking the approval process and the scientific merits of the data seriously at least! which is good IMO
0	Do syringes grow on trees or in the ground? If its not found in nature then its not ment to be in the body its called common sense
0	Seems like you both are well informed about vaccinations, why not make your own vaccines?
0	If this vaccine is so good why is it killing people all over the world
0	Makes no sense take a vaccine n wear a mask üò∑ ding ding nwo n mrna
0	Population control. Well done.
0	They're all pseudoscience pushing eugenics
0	Bill Gates has enough money to end world hunger instead he is creating more vaccines! Coincedence?
1	I'd rather risk a Covid-19 vaccine side effect as opposed to actually getting covid-19
1	I wasvaccinated on 01/22, still doing good! Had mild soreness at site of injection for first two days. No other symptoms, but still monitoring
1	I'm allergic to eggs and I finally this year was able to find someone who'd give me a flu shot. I felt a little flushed for a few minutes afterwards, but that's it. Much less than the side effect my family suffered of having to put up with me for another year.
1	More vaccine for the rest of us
0	It turns you in to a flesh eating √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏√¢‚Ç¨ÔÜç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ÔÜè.
1	Received mine on Friday! So glad things are speeding up
1	The fact the ymca has now had a covid case and I‚Äôm still hearing people say they won‚Äôt get the vaccine. Plz just fucking get it I don‚Äôt want covid coz I passed someone in the corridor who‚Äôs been partying because ‚Äúcovid is a hoax and the vaccine has dead baby‚Äôs in‚Äù
