0	"It is a pity" that people are dying from the vaccine that would otherwise be healthy. These are not the same people that would have died from the virus, mind you. These people would have lived long healthy lives.
0	"anti-vaccer" is a weaponized term so these pharmaceutical companies can get their way. You have to come up with a counter term like "drug pusher"
0	#Poison
0	1 more good reason to homeschool! My body! My choice!
0	100 percent the reason im not getting it is because i dont trust the government
1	100% against hospitalization and death. They should of said this from go.
0	11 months on and still no symptoms. I feel great. No vaccine and have been visiting my 91 year old nan who smokes ALOT and she's fine. This is about depopulation a Eugenics program.
1	13k idiots. Natural selection. Let the people who wanna be safe. Don’t take it. More for the smarter people.
1	6 cases out of over 6 million doses administered. Is that even statistically significant?
0	6 people died due to the pfizer vaccine. Why are we still giving it???
1	90% is hugely effective! They're not done with Phase 3 trials, but this is very promising. I'm overjoyed. Thank you, scientists!
0	90% with no idea of immunity or transmission? I'll take the 99 % survival rate w/natural immunity without inserting man-made materials into my body at cell Level.
0	99.6% of ACTIVE cases have mild or no symptoms. WHY would you get a vaccine for THAT?!?!
0	99.8% survival rate without a vaccine.
1	A lot of you are alive because your parents made sure that you were vaccinated against the diseases that were killing children in the 40&50s. So what if you had a sore arm you are on the right side of the grass to complain about it. I am 81, have had my second shot no problems.
1	A vaccine created in a year is an amazing achievement for science and humanity . I feel proud to live in these times.
0	A vaccine takes a number of years to be developed, this alone is reason enough to be antivaxx
0	A vaccine that nobody is held accountable if I develop a reaction or die? Yeah, no thanks.
0	AVOID these VERY DANGEROUS Covid-19 VACCINES!!!!
0	About 4 months ago, I had COVID-19. I just got my first vaccine and I became very ill with fever, chills, body aches and dizzy spells. Now I’m afraid to get the second dose. Any suggestions?
0	Absolutely no way will I have this vaccine
1	Absolutely. For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
0	After almost dying from a cortisone injection which a doctor said was safe I can say that I would fight to the death before letting anyone inject my future children with any big pharma drug.
1	All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19
1	All I can say is wow!!
1	All countries, rich and poor, are deeply affected by the virus, and that the vaccination or vaccine distribution should be for all, not for the few.
1	All who doesn’t take the vaccine want Corona to keep harvesting lives and wreak Havoc upon the world
0	All you have to do is beat them at their own game! Just say “I identify as fully vaccinated.” They can’t demand proof or it’s discrimination!!!!
0	All you have to do is build your immune system zinc vitamin D three vitamin C find a good holistic doctor and talk to them you don't need the vaccine
0	Alright, so now look into the covid protein spike and it's prion capable modification. Make sure you understand what you are getting yourself into when you take those shots, and it will also shed some light on the side effects you may have seen.
1	Amazing news! I just hope that people will think about the bigger picture here. Yes covid has a 99% survival rate but I encourage everyone to have this vaccine to protect the vulnerable in society not just themselves!
1	Amazing video! I'm glad I caught up to this before taking my first shot of Pfizer's. Most of my family are vaccinated with the two doses and barely had side effects. While I may seem as anti-vaccine, I just say that because I don't feel the need to vaccinate myself, but I also don't deny the statistics of a vaccine when it works; lowering death toll and infection rate.
1	An infected teacher standing up projecting their voice (virus) can infect a whole class of students in a lesson and in turn their families. That is why it is vital to vaccinate all teachers before ending remote learning.
1	And a vaccine literally introduces the virus to your immune system in a non harmful way... Good food doesn't produce antibodies, a vaccine does.
0	And the companies that produce these vaccines are immune from prosecution should it all go wrong. Funny that, they're obviously concerned about how this vaccine is going to affect some people.
1	And you’re more likely to be hit by lightning than get a blood clot from a vaccine (odds are less than one in a million)
1	Anti Vaxxer logic: My kid can’t get autism, if they die from polio
1	Anti vaxxers will ignore all of the facts. This is proof that the covid vaccines are safe. They've all had human trials.
1	Anti-vaxers chose to believe the lie because the lie is always more interesting than the truth
1	Antibodies were detected after the vaccine
0	Any side effects doctor. None at all just death. But if you get covid you may die. Just vaccinate me to make sure I die than.
1	Any vaccine is a better chance of NOT having clots than not getting it at all. Bring back the J&J. I’d rather suffer once and take the risk
0	Anybody stupid enough to take this vaccine...
0	Anyone who gets offended and defensive when asked about their product, it's because they have a hidden agenda.
0	Aren’t these vaccines still very experimental?
1	As a biochemist in training I can't stress enough how incredible this mechanism is: logical, simple yet incredibly effective and beautiful.
1	As a clinical analyst and graduate in Public Health, this man did an excellent job in detailing the efficacy and workings of these vaccines. Everyone should watch and consider getting vaccinated! We deserve our livelihood back.
0	As a healthcare worker, I am NOT taking the vaccine at all. As an Army veteran, I do not trust it.
1	As a participant, who definitely got the vaccine, that's awesome news. Please get vaccinated with this or another approved vaccine when possible people, and trust science for goodness sakes.
1	As a wise man once said, "Taking COVID-19 vaccination is like wearing a seatbelt in a car. There are possibilities that can give you some amount of dangers if you wear a seatbelt, but there are also a MUCH more amount of dangers or possibly death if you don't wear a seatbelt. Either way, no one is correct since they technically have their separate amount of dangers, but wearing a seatbelt is usually much safer than not wearing a seatbelt." And I really do agree with him. That's all :)
0	As an older healthy fit person that works out hard, takes care of their health and hasn't been sick in 7 years I don't need it! MY BODY MY CHOICE!
1	As bad as this pamdemic was I honestly think it may have advanced medicine by 10 years then where it otherwise would have been
1	As someone who was born autistic I get really offended by the fact Karen’s would rather have their children die then have autism.
1	As soon as it's my turn, yes. I think it's irresponsible to not get it.
1	AstraZeneca 2 weeks ago, I feel healthy, hoping after my next jab I feel the same.
1	Awesome news! The vaccines are going to end this pandemic soon.
1	Ay finally I can prove to my mom why vaccines are important
1	Back in my day, we didn't have vaccines. We just died.
1	Being born to an anti vaccine mom is like being spawn killed
1	Believe in vaccines
1	Best explanation I have seen so far on vaccines. My goodness. This should be shown everywhere.
1	Best thing you can do for yourself is get the one that’s available to you at the earliest and don’t wait. that’s gonna do worlds better than trying to compare them or waiting.
1	Best vaccine is the one that’s available to you first
0	Better develop medication to give to people who need it in case of Covid instead of poisoning healthy folks.
0	Big NO TO VACCINES ! We need Healthy lifestyle only .
1	Biontech and curevac basicly startet the mrna thing and, after they cured covid, they could also find a cure for cancer with this technology. Very promising.
0	Blood clots, uncontrollable shakes and death but keep wearing a mask ... oh and the vaccines are absolutely safe .... bs!
1	Boom! What a fantastic achievement by researchers, scientists, AI and ML professionals and field professionals! Just a colossal achievement!
1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important parts of COVID-19 disease that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
1	Both of my grandparents got theirs and no reported issues. My grandma got hers about a month ago now and only said there was a little pain in her arm but they is 100% normal. The rest of my family is getting it Monday :)
1	Bring it on so we can live again
0	Bro. The vaccine side effects are the virus symptoms? Whats goin on there?
0	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already. Something is not right
1	COVID will have a silver lining. Vaccine development is going to advance 10 years. I'd rather get a vaccine than the virus.
1	COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection
1	COVID-19 vaccination will be an important tool to help stop the pandemic
1	COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting COVID-19
0	Call it a treatment. It’s not a vaccine. It doesn’t even fit the CDC definition for a vaccine.
1	Can help to improve immunity
1	Can't wait for my parents to get vaccinated.
0	Can't wait to see how this vax reacts with the next round of engineered covid.
1	Can’t wait until my son can get it.
1	China vaccines good
0	Considering they weren't even rushing in that case as they are now I see no reason to trust whatever vaccine they come out with and I'll definitely not take their vaccine until at least 2/3 years pass without incident
1	Cooking at home or taking a bath is more dangerous than having the vaccine. Less than 1 in a million side effects!
0	Covid passport was a conspiracy theory 11 months ago . Now look
1	Crazy how some people believe the links their friends post on Facebook more than doctors who have studied medicine for years.
0	Crimes Against Humanity
0	DON’T DO IT! Well, it is your choice but don’t tell me to do it!
1	Day 11 on Moderna and I feel fine. Just had sore arm the day after I got it.
1	Day 12 on moderna no side affects so far I feel good
0	Deadly cocktail of chemicals
0	Definitely not taking this poison
0	Do not take the vaccine, do I repeat myself ,DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE!!!!
0	Do not take the vaccine. If they make you take it, fight for your life and go to WAR
0	Don't care what this guy and the media says about the vaccine! Read my lips, I am not taking the cr!p
0	Don't get the Vaccine
0	Don't get the vaccine
0	Don't let the government infect you're cells with RNA. You're natural immune system is all you or anyone needs! Believe in nature and yourself!
0	Don't take any vaccine because its all toxic.
0	Don't take this vaccine guys!!
0	Don't take vaccines. Just pray
0	Don't trust the vaccine . My choice .
0	Don't trust these "vaccines".
0	Don’t become their GUINEA PIG to see if you live or die!
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up.
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up. Especially if the media deletes videos on exposing what the vaccine exactly is!
0	Every death is significant!!!!! Someone’s family member has died due to this POISON!!!! This is experimental gene therapy!!!!
0	Every drug has side effects
1	Everybody, finishing something quickly doesn't mean it is rushed
0	Everyone keep injection there poison in your body you have that right but do not take away my right to choose
1	Everyone should take the vaccine Even the anti-vaccine people
1	Exact same side effects as every other vaccine, people are just always scared of the unknown.
0	Expect cancer , infertility and other illnesses to sky rocket , now , in the short term and long term ,
0	Experimental! GOOD LUCK! but we are goooood! no Vaxx here thank you!, I'll pick getting infected let's gooooo
0	Explain why you get a sore throat from the vaccine and all the symptoms of having the virus. That can only happen if it is invading cells!
1	FUCK YEAH!!! My family and I were able to get our first doses yesterday! Happy to be part of this statistic!!!
0	First let me say forget about the"vaccine". Not taking it. I went thru the whole year as a essential worker. Sometimes didn't wear a mask. No virus. The government is doing something shady I just don't know what it is but miss me with this BS vaccine
1	Flu vaccines regularly have 40-60% efficacy, considered to be good. Anything that is 60% - 90% efficacy is 'simply the best'
0	Folks, it’s really simple. Don’t let anyone with zero liability stick an experimental substance that has a terrible track record with animals into your body. This is DUH 101.
0	For a disease that has a 0.01% chance of killing me in the first place, why would I take a vaccine that has a highe chance of killing me than the disease itself? I'm no anti-vaxxer, but im definitely not getting ANY of these covid vaccines.
1	For anyone wondering, the vaccines are perfectly safe. I got mine today and didn’t immediately die. My mom also got her’s a week before mine and she’s fine
0	For this vaccine human are the rats,
1	Fortunately, a vaccine for Covid-19 has also been produced. That means all activities will be returned to its orbit and happy life lies ahead.
0	Fuck the Vaccine
0	Fully test them first and let all of the pharmaceutical companies do what's in the best interest of the public. Not about the profit.
1	Fully vaccinated!!! Suck it COVID!!!
1	Fully vaxxed as of last week since i quit my old job and joined a hospital in late Feb. GF just got her first shot too through our vaccine-share program that is constantly filled up. For the first time in a longtime I've started to feel hopeful.
1	Fully vaxxed as of today! Such a relief.
1	Funny that all those people that are scared of the vaccine, drive their car, cooking, take medicine every day.. Each of these have higher odds of dying than the 1 in 10 million of the vaccine (Astra only)
0	Garbage vaccines with ZERO longterm data.
1	Get the vaccine
0	Get the vaccine and you are guaranteed to look like the toxic crusader in a few years
1	Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1	Getting mine in a week and I'm so stoked
1	Getting my first dose in a few hours, I'm glad this pandemic will be over soon
1	Getting my first shot in about ten minutes
1	Getting my first vaccine tomorrow. This helped out my mind at ease a bit.
1	Getting my second Pfizer shot next week. Cant wait!
1	Getting my vaccine today!!!
0	Giving people this vacchine is a crime
1	Glad they can be vaccinated. Wish availability of vaccine vastly improves so all who want a vaccine can get one.
1	Glad to see senior citizens are getting the shots first
0	God created me and I will not inject poison into his creation...never ever
1	God help us to get more people vaccinted quickly.
0	God’s intelligence is far superior. Our body is a self healer with right diet and environment. Our body is our doctor. Vaccines is designed to depopulate the world. Herbs are created for us to treat our illness by that supreme being. Please try to understand that we are being controlled. It’s all business. Money making.
0	Good for you. I don't want the vaccine. So leave me alone.
0	Good luck to all of you who took any of these-vaccines- however I refuse to take any vaccine for this 95 percent exaggerated illness as mainly I feel it is anti-Biblical.
0	Good luck with that!! No to Covid vaccine
1	Good news because the pace of vaccination needs to pick up soon. Two million a day in the U.S. should be the floor.
1	Good news!
1	Goodness I'm so happy you made this video!! The amount of anti-maskers and anti-vaxers is increasing and its so disappointing! Spreading right info and educating the general public is more important than ever! So thank you for this!
1	Got mine in maryland usa yesterday. Sore arm and a little fatigue but 1000% worth it.
1	Got mine today! So stoked.
1	Got my 2nd dose of moderna Thursday. No side effects!
1	Got my 2nd dose of vaccine no symptoms and no pain
1	Got my Oxford AZ vaccine on Friday. Easy. Slight fever for 24 hours and that’s it. Same with my 85 year old granny. I’m 24. Safe for all ages. Go get it! My confidence has grown a lot. We are almost there!!✌🏻
1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine.
1	Got my first Pfizer first dose and feeling good. Can’t wait for the second dose.
1	Got my first dose of Pfizer today. I was not ready for the atmosphere. Everyone was just so UP and excited and happy. It was the most fun I’ve had with strangers in over a year.
1	Got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning! So incredibly happy about it! Experiencing nothing but a sore arm.
1	Got my first moderna vaccine today. Health department texted at 1pm went right over to the site and was done by 2 pm. No way was I not going to get this shot.
1	Got my second dose today, wish me luck! And congrats to everyone who is fully vaccinated
0	Got my second dose yesterday. I never felt more sick in my life. Vomit, chills, running a bad fever, nausea, etc
1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine!
1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine! In fact I feel better than after the first shot where I just had some deltoid tenderness. Now I feel normal!
1	Got my shot thanks to Wisconsin's Save the Fatties program.
1	Got the Pfizer a month ago. Second dose makes you feel weak, but it's all worth it. I'm vaccinated
1	Got vaccinated with sinovac from China last week. So far no side effects. I even went to the gym 3 hours after i got vaccinated
0	Government: don’t worry it’s your choice to get the vaccine! Also government: we will limit your rights and restrict your freedoms because you didn’t get the vaccine your now second class citizens.
0	Governments cannot protect you. Your God given immune system CAN!
1	Great news. Fantastic work by those involved in creating this vaccine, so thankful to them.
1	Great video! Most of my family have had it and they're okay! A friend of mine told me the MMR is the reason I'm autistic.... I told him to do one
1	Great! Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
1	Greetings from Mexico, my parents just got the Pfizer vaccine. They feel great! thanks to the scientist for this great achievement.
1	Had my first AZ shot 5 days ago and so far it has been a non event....not even a sore arm....
1	Had my first dose of Astra today, the pain on the jab area was way worse than my flu vaccine shot last year, it works!
1	Had my second dose a week ago. I'm so relieved to have gotten it, as I see the death toll and permanent injuries rising due to this disease. Wear your mask, wash your hands, social distance, and get vaccinated! That is how we will defeat COVID.
1	Had the vaccine yesterday feel great nothing but a sore and swollen arm
0	Hahahaa so much fun!!!!! We injecting chemicles!!!
1	Have already been vaccinated “ and I hope covid-19 stay away forever
0	He isn't concerned. Tell that to the family of those who died from the shot. My daughters customer said her mother ended up in ICU after the 2nd shot.
0	He wouldn’t tell us anyway. Two friends of mine died 2 weeks after getting the Pfizer vaccine. Why are the censoring immunologists and the developer who use to work with Fauci. This guy needs to be investigated.
0	Hell no I will not take it
0	Hell no... no vaccine
1	Hey cinco de mayo for my second shot too! High five! But I'm not going out to celebrate right away, I'm planning to take a week off for memorial day week and travel somewhere!
1	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger. People who refuse the vaccine because it is “too new” and “dangerous” are 1) wrong because the newest vaccines are similar to old vaccines proven to work, just specific to covid strains, and 2) selfish for putting their own standards above the livelihood and health of others.
1	Hope he got the vaccine. Either way thank you to him for furthering science!
0	How about we start with bels palsy or violent seizures. Or my favorite death. Take this vaccine at your own risk!!!
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
1	How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead.
0	How naive the world is, this isn’t a vaccine
1	Huge news to get vaccine to the masses. We’re going to have a great summer America! Hope you’ve been working on that beach bod during quarantine
1	Hype ! Gonna take my Vaccine immediately . So cool . !
1	I JUST WANT TO END THIS, THE VACCINE IS THE THING THAT I WANT FROM THE START
0	I REALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY OF THIS IT WAS PRODUCED TO FAST
0	I WILL NEVER GET THIS VACCINE ! It needs more time to develope
1	I Will Get The Vaccine
0	I ain't got to plan for the side effects..cause I ain't gettin it!!! Suckers!!!
0	I aint taking ur zombie vaccine
1	I already got my vaccine and getting my second dose in mid January. hoping 2021 is a better year for all of us.
1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes. Which suggests that I am forming an immunity, but just something that I wanted to share since it was pretty noticeable. I also had soreness of the injection site but other than that nothing else.
1	I also work in healthcare, I am proud to be a Caregiver and yes if I can get the vaccine I will. The well being of my Family and my clients are number one.
1	I am 80 and my wife is 77 and we took the Moderna vaccine and had no side effects on either shot.
1	I am a UCLA retiree and I still can’t even get my first vaccine because I cannot find any appointments
1	I am a doctor in the U.K. I had the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks! All vaccines will have some degree of risk. The most important thing about vaccination is that it will significantly reduce the chances of you dying or ending up on a ventilator regardless of which vaccine you have!
0	I am a double organ transplant recipient with a compromised immune system. My transplant Dr. said absolutely no! Not nearly enough tests or results available yet.
0	I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
1	I am fully vaccinated and was fine second dose just soreness
0	I am not doing the vaccine, thank you.
0	I am not getting it because I don't want to die
0	I am not going to become an experimentation subject for the global mRNA testing. Even if they pay me to do it . I can't be sure that it doesn't touch the DNA and also i find it useless.
0	I am not going to get the vaccine
1	I am planning to take one of these vaccines I believe they are going to make a difference I have no intention of wanting to be locked in doors to stay safe. Bring it on
1	I am so lucky to have been vaccinated and not have to worry so much. There are still so many things to do in life.
0	I bet the stats won't say "died within 28 days of a positive vaccine "
1	I can't wait for my second shot in 4 weeks!
1	I can't wait to get mine. Unfortunately my special Premier and his cabinet members who were all traveling abroad for Xmas (on Dec 13th they put a traveling ban both for cross provinces and international borders) are deemed more important than me and the majority of the population, so I have to wait.
1	I can't wait to get the vaccine! I am at risk and haven't left my home in a year. After I get it I'm going to double-mask and get a hair cut :)
1	I cannot understand why so many people don't wan to get the vaccine, I can understand it in some circumstances, but I believe that that is the underground scenario
1	I cant wait to receive my vaccine.
1	I can’t wait to get mine!
1	I did not have a "medical professional" advise me to get or not get the vaccination....I read the chart, and since I am over 65, and have some of the health issues, I signed up. No one said anything to me at either of the injection sites about whether I should get the shot or not. People have to use their own judgement and common sense about what to do...."medical professionals" all have different opinions.!!
0	I don't care about your facts or myths. Its all BS to me. I will never take this ridiculous vaccine! They will never tell you what's really in it! THINK TWICE!!
0	I don't care how many black nurses, celebrities, or tv doctors get the vaccine I'm not taking it.
0	I don't need to be told how to evaluate covid vaccine reactions. If someone was fine, gets the vaccine and dies with days or weeks; the vaccine caused it.
0	I don't trust doctors,the medical profession and the vaccine has not been tested long enough.
1	I don't understand why 20 percent of careworkers wont have the vaccine .How can they say they care for their clients if they potentially will bring the infection back .Some are visiting 6 or 7 homes a day .If they dont care enough to have the vaccine they should find another job
0	I dont trust that vaccination at all
0	I don’t care what is said, I am not getting the Covid vaccine
0	I don’t fully trust the vaccine yet until a couple months pass
0	I don’t have to do anything I’m not comfortable doing.
0	I don’t need a vaccine, the vitamin gummy bear I ate 4 years ago got my back
0	I don’t trust it!
1	I don’t trust trump, but I do trust the vaccine. I’m getting it ASAP.
1	I don’t understand why six people in six million (J&J,) is this much of a concern. Seems like the virus is much more dangerous.
1	I don’t understand why there are people on here telling others NOT to get vaccinated! You are part of the problem.
0	I don’t want a vaccine no way, why can’t they treat the common cold, something isn’t right
0	I feel bad for those who signed up for the experiment and thought they were given the vaccine when actually they're given a placebo
1	I feel better after the injection
1	I feel like I lost brain cells watching these anti vaxxers
0	I find it very unsettling that the majority of the covid videos had a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 10 or so. Now, it's about the opposite. Don't trust the illusion, guys. The vaccine kills.
1	I get J&J and none symptoms at all👍
1	I get me second tomorrow. I can’t explain the feeling of freedom (2 weeks later, I know, but nice to have it over with).
1	I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow

1	I got mine. I’m a kindergarten teacher. No side effects, no creepy stuff in it. If you are given the opportunity, take it. Try to be as brave and selfless as we are on the front lines in kindergarten.
1	I got my 2nd shot yesterday. No side effects unless you count that I get 5G on a 4G phone now and I have a hankering for human flesh.
1	I got my Moderna vaccine and now I'm a Wifi Hotspot
1	I got my Pfizer shot yesterday the only problem was my arm is a little stiff but other than that it’s all good.
1	I got my second dose earlier this month. I feel a-okay. 👍🏻
1	I got my second injection and once again my only side effect was a sore arm for a couple of days. I used an ice pack on it and that helped.
1	I got my vaccine today, got the Johnson and Johnson, it was the least painfully vaccine I have ever got, and I am very excited for my city is open 100%
1	I got the AstraZeneca vaccine today and glad that I did
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine. Last one is on April 1. So happy! No side effects!
1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination today. I managed to get it despite being 29 and otherwise in perfect health because I volunteer at my local hospital. Glad to be in the 10% with the vaccine so far.
1	I got the first shot yesterday and feel fine
1	I got the vaccine both doses of Moderna and I’m thriving. Stop putting false fears.
1	I got the vaccine, still alive and haven't grown a tail
1	I got vaccinated last week, Moderna. Zero side effects. Second shot in 2 weeks.
1	I got vaccinated with first dose 2 weeks ago and i feel great without side affects, i hope the second dose will be fine
0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them
1	I had a 102 Fever, chills, body aches, headache, lower back pain for 2 days, etc. but I would do it again. It's better than having covid and NOT BEING ABLE TO BREATHE!!!
1	I had excellent experiences when I got both my shots. Very nice people. Barely felt anything when shots administered. Very professional, kind, prompt, thoughtful.
1	I had mine about two months now I don’t have no side effects thank god
1	I had my 2 shot vaccine covid-19...and it feel great, only arm sore,no big deal,...is a good feeling,my body is protective and I feel confident.....huyyyyy
1	I had the Pfizer vaccination yesterday. Apart from a sore arm, absolutely no side effects after 30 hours.
1	I had the vaccine yesterday and literally watched the microchip enter my arm. Now all I see is Bill Gates and Microsoft Windows, but not Windows 10, the shitty Windows Vista operating software. God, if only I'd listened to the Youtube comment experts!! I'm also autistic now.
0	I have a cousin and his wife, who do vaccine research, and collectively have 40 years experience in this field .They told me never to take a vaccine....I'll listen to them.
0	I have a friend that took his son for shots and overnight the kid changed!! I saw it happen. I know it's true.
1	I have had both series of covid Vaccines, I am still alive and well, with no side effects besides my arm is sore from the shot. I'm proud to say I am vaccinated against covid and also the flu.
0	I have more chance of surviving with Covid than with the Covid vaccine....
1	I have never seen so many people in such a dither about taking a stupid shot. Where were your rantings and ravings when you took the pneumonia shot, the shingles shot, measles shot, pneumonia shot? Now, here's one that stands a very good chance of possibly saving your life and you act like someone's taking your firstborn!!!!! What an EXCELLENT example of how grown, intelligent people are expected to act.
1	I have stage 4 lung cancer, received my first round of covid-19 vaccine in December. No side effects other than some soreness in the muscle for a few days. I'll be receiving my second dose on the 26th. Just wanted to say thanks for all the informed info!
0	I have thecovid and have the antibody in my system. Why do I need a vaccine
0	I have trouble trusting people who can't figure out if a mask can help, when they tell us, trust us the vaccine is safe.... oh by the way we not responsible when it goes wrong.
1	I hope Suptnik V is granted for Emergency Use. ✌✌ https://t.co/KwYgsd5C29
1	I hope l can get mine soon l am 67 and have health conditions been shielded for 4 weeks can’t wait till I can go out again
1	I hope the vaccines will save all the people around the world. God bless you all out there
0	I just automatically assume people who get the vaccine barely have the IQ to push a broom.
1	I just got mine today 🙌🏼💉🦠 my arm hurts right there on the spot. That means is working 💪🏼
1	I just got my Pfizer biontec vaccine at UNC and I was thrilled to see your information on this to know about the vaccine in my body! Thank you so much!
1	I just got my second pfizer shot yesterday! I have been anxious about side effects but nearly 24 hours later and I haven't felt a thing. I'm so relieved! Excited to get back to living a normal life.
1	I just made my appointment for my first vaccine.
1	I just spent an half an hour reading anti vax comments, I have lost faith in humanity.
1	I just want to thank them and every other scientist working on this around the world
1	I know it sucks, but take it from a survivor, the long term side effects of being moderately sick from COVID is so much worse, one year later still, than a couple days of crappy feeling from getting the vaccine.
1	I know more people who've been vaccinated than people who've had COVID. So happy to see the rollout gaining steam!
0	I know quite a few Black people who aren't going to get the vaccine. I happen to be one of them.
0	I know that manufacturers refuse to vaccinate with their own vaccines
1	I look at it as yes, there is some risk to the vaccine, since it's only been studied 3 months or so, but there is definite risk to Covid. I am high-risk so I'll chance it with the vaccine.
0	I love how people use “anti vaxers” as a way to belittle or dismiss them when quite frankly many of them have extremely valid intelligent arguments as to their stance.
1	I love how when you present scientific evidence, people still don’t believe you and say you’re being paid for this and/or pushing an agenda. Believe your conspiracy theories all you want... I’m going to choose to not live in fear.
1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one, I'm old and at high risk. that's why I can't get one
0	I prefer to rely on my natural immune system, nourished by real food that we were designed to eat, good hygiene and a healthy lifestyle.
1	I received the vaccine yesterday! i am in healthcare. i have only had a sore arm and a slight feeling of hotness. other than that i feel great!
0	I reject your 666 inject!
1	I still think the odds are better than good and would take it. Send it to Ontario.
0	I still wouldn't get covid vaccine. It's too hasty and too soon.
1	I sure hope so. I WANT one.
1	I think god just made covid 19 for eliminate all anti-vaxxers
1	I think the vaccine is ok.
1	I think they will probably make limitations for your daily life if you don’t take the vaccine so you will be kind of forced to take it :/
0	I too am refusing the vaccine!! Anytime you have to threaten people to take something raises a Red Flag for me!!!
1	I took both vaccines from pfizer and feel perfectly well, its my 10th day following the second shot. just a one day arm pain. Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1	I took my first dose of Pfizer's vaccine on Friday. I am happy.
1	I took the first Moderna vaccine 27 days ago. 14 days ago, my husband test positive for C-19 after he became symptomatic . My grandson and I tested five days later after my husband experienced symptoms. My grandson tested positive. I tested negative. I’am taking the second shot tomorrow! I’am a firm believer that the vaccine works!
0	I took vaccine from FLU when I was 10 with my brother it was so bad were seriously sick for 2 weeks very badly so since then don';t want to take any vaccines.
0	I trust my immune system more than the vaccines. So, No, thank u I better opt out for being a lab .
0	I trust my mask more than any of the Covid-19 Vaccines.
0	I trust that vaccine about as much as I trust the 2020 presidential election…
1	I want to be vaccinated
1	I was also one who worried about how quickly this vaccine was developed. In reality the scientists have used years...make that decades of research to develop it. When it comes right down to it, If we can’t trust science who can we trust? I’ll be ready to take the vaccine when my turn comes.
1	I was born in 1951. The measles vaccine wasn’t developed until 1963. I got measles as did many of my friends. One friend ended up with heart damage and another went deaf. So you bet my kids were vaccinated on schedule. For everything.
0	I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it’s being forced. I’m definitely NOT getting it 😂.
0	I was vaccine neutral until this mRNA injection came along... RED FLAGS everywhere.
0	I will NOT be forced to take a shot.
1	I will definitely get it but I don't mind waiting a bit for the people who really need it to have it first.
1	I will get it as soon as I'm able.
0	I will never let them jab me even if i have to quit my job... NEVER IM TALKING FIGHT
0	I will never take a coronavirus vaccine, there’s a reason why their blowing this all out of proportion
0	I will never take a vaccine that hasn't been through phase 3 testing. No one knows the long term effects of this.
0	I will never take dat poison!! You can have all my family’s doses!! Thank me later!!
0	I will never, ever understand why people actually think the government EVER has your best interests at heart.
0	I will not be no one's lab rat !! Thank you .
0	I will not. I do not find enough info in the studies to trust
0	I will rather take care of my COVID and treat it I don’t have COVID but it’s really stupid cause it’s like they put crack in the vaccine I’m glad I don’t take it
0	I will take my chances on a virus that has a 99.6% survival rate
1	I wish this kind of videos is what the media told in the news. I've never felt so hopeful about COVID until this video. Well done!
1	I wish we could send people back in time to see what it was like when huge percentages of children died from diseases before they reached age 5. It would offer some much-needed perspective.
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me I was sick for 6 months
0	I won't take it no matter what.
0	I wont take this vernomous poisons never
0	I won’t take this ever. I’ll rely on my immune system thanks
1	I work at a nursing home and I can’t wait for this to come out to us
0	I work in emergency medicine and would NEVER pump that poison into my body. Created in God's image, not about to change that fact.
0	I would NEVER consider myself an anti-vaxer but you gotta be out your damn mind to immediately take a vaccine that was characterized for being one of the fastest to make it through trials...
0	I would like to see doctors, politicians and rich people take the vaccine live on tv
1	I would rather deal with the issues of the vaccines than have my child die from those diseases that the vaccines have proven to prevent.
0	I would rather open fire on hundreds of people before I take the culling poison
0	I'd rather die, than let them change my DNA.
0	I'd rather eat glass.
0	I'd rather take my supplements...... you can have my share of the vaccine
1	I'll happily take both vaccines if there are so many idiots who will forfeit theirs.
0	I'll say no to a vaccine but I'll take a double triple bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four animal style, with a shimmy and a squeeze, burn it and let it swim
0	I'll take my chances with a 3 day cough instead of this vaccine.
0	I'll take my chances without getting the vaccine! Thank you very much
0	I'll take my chances without the vaccine thank you.
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel.
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel. Thank you Pfizer.
1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow
1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid
0	I'm donating mine to gov officials
1	I'm getting my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today and this comes up. thank you for such an informative video
1	I'm getting my first dose tomorrow and I feels so nice to have the end in sight I could almost cry
0	I'm good. My immune system is fine.
1	I'm hyped for this vaccine, even if I grow a third limb
1	I'm in Portugal and I'll take the first vaccine made available as soon as I can get one, that's the least I can do in the name of those who lost their lives and didn't get a fight chance.
1	I'm just happy this vaccine exists. The numbers regarding allergic reactions are reassuring, and catching the side effects of the vaccine looks comparatively better than catching the virus.
1	I'm looking forward to the day(s) I get mine. Living in Europe however, it is unclear when this will be. Until that day follow advice and stay safe.
0	I'm not an anti vax but I would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
0	I'm not anti vaccine but I have my concerns due to how fast they are being rushed out. I may wait a few months first
0	I'm not getting it for at least 1-2 years. And only if the virus evolves and it's necessary to have a base immunity
0	I'm not getting the vaccine I dont trust it .
0	I'm not kidding, you'd have to literally threaten my life in order for me to take any of these!!
0	I'm not taking it because the former Presidents will take it for me. It's funny how the mainstream media forcing and labeling people anti vaxx.
0	I'm not taking it, as it has not been trialled for long enough. Nobody knows the long-term effects.
0	I'm not taking the vaccine. I don't trust it. I'm not sick either & i have a strong immune system. No way vaccine
1	I'm not worried about taking it, but I already had covid, so it would be in better use for someone who needs it.
1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now. This is fantastic news! Merry Christmas everyone! 🎆💖🎄☃️☮️😊
0	I'm still not taking that evil vaccine
0	I'm still not taking this thrown together in less than a year vaccine... took me longer to plan my wedding
0	I'm still not taking this vaccine. More people survive this plandemic then deaths. They push this harder than anything else.
1	I'm vaccinated, everyone I know is vaccinated. 95% of my country is vaccinated. I don't see any negative effects of this.
0	I've already had COVID so why get the vaccine. That is what no one will explain.
0	I've been flush since I got it. I don't feel well and am always very tired. I would have not gotten if I knew this....
1	I've just got my first dose. I am proud of such used technology. Hope to see its effect in other ways.
0	ILL NEVER TAKE THE VACCINE
1	Iam am pro-vax and don't want a rushed vaccine.
0	If companies are so confident in their vaccines then they would be able to get sued for side effects
0	If it is so safe, why do they tell us they will not be held responsible for any adverse affects.
0	If it's going to take years anyway would it not have been better to just let it run its course?
0	If it's so great let's all vaccine companies get sued if things go wrong. Then people might take it.
0	If mRNA vaccines are totally new and have never been used before, why would the FDA think longterm side effects would reveal themselves within 2 months?
1	If my country is not available to get vaccine yet , could I travel to which country to get it?, thanks
1	If no one decided to take the vaccine, we wouldn't make any progress!
0	If the company is immune to being sued. Thats a super big RED FLAG
0	If the flu and COVID have similar mortality rates then why worry about it? Everyone doesn’t take a flu shot.....so why should anyone take a COVID shot?
0	If the government is pushing you to take something into your body be aware
0	If their so safe, then why have the government made it impossible for these companies that make them free from legal action for vaccine damage ?
0	If they lockdown again, I won’t trust the vaccine to keep me safe. No matter what the “experts” say.
0	If they try to inject me with this vaccine I'm gonna inject them with lead
0	If they were so sure it was safe they would make it legal to sue the company
1	If we get enough people vaccinated in the entire population, there won't be as many people to care for infected with SARS-COV-2. Here's hoping we can get to that point sooner rather than later.
0	If you want the vaccine, go take it. Me? No thanks.
0	If you’ve done your research from the real scientists you would know never to take this experimental gene therapy! 1,000’s have been injured or have died! This so called ‘vaccination’ isn’t even approved by the FDA! If you’re listening to Fauci you’re forked!!
1	Im from singapore . Already vaccinated and i feel strong
1	Im getting my covid vaccine
0	Im going to wait for ten or more years and if people still around i will take vaccine then NOT!
0	Im not having it, no way
1	Im pretty sure plenty rather have vaccine then catch covid
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be blackmailed into taking it..For a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it....
1	Immunization can be achieved as soon as possible after vaccination
0	In other words, WHO is saying all those who were vaccinated you are the guinea pigs for their experiment
1	Incredibly blessed to have gotten my second dose today. Feel lousy side effects but it’s worth it.
0	Infections in the United States are down by 44%. I believe that this is because everybody is already infected. The covid19 hibernates and the only way to detect hibernating covid19 is in the stool. So why do we need vaccines? Especially since masks and social distancing is still going to be required.
0	Instead of the population, why the same scientists who designed it, don't receive the first shots if they are so sure it won't risk their health?
1	Internet moms: vaccines are safe-ish Well it's better than having your child dead-ish
0	Is there a coffin included with vaccine ? What about costs my family has to pay.
0	It means the shot is poison, and the immune system is suffering.
1	It seems to me that there’s nothing about these vaccines that should cause problems. They’re mRNA delivery services. After that, it’s just the body/cells processing mRNA, as it always does.
0	It takes YEARS to find out if a new drug is safe.
0	It takes years and sometimes decade's to get it right. I think this one is a dangerous one.
0	It will mess up your DNA
1	It would be great to have a vaccine before contracting the virus. More conventional and similar to the flu shot.
0	It's a no for me dog! Hard Pass!
1	It's gonna be like a fucking freight train. Once we pick up speed we're golden. Especially once Biden invokes DPA and it's all hands on deck.
0	It's not safe they are trying to mess with our DNA
0	It's one year since this virus started spreading so probably by now almost everyone have had it...no need for a vaccine
1	It's really important vaccinate all people in the airports of the United States. All people who travel to the United States. Thank you.
0	It's sad and it just amazes me sometimes how you say that all the side effects are minor and whatever side effects there are that they're being dealt with and they're better afterwards when I've seen evidence of people that had neurological problems like problems that they basically did not come back from but we're not talking about that
0	It's scary that we are putting this in so many people when it was developed so recently and we don't know what the long-term implications are.
0	It's simple. If someone is pushing the vaccine, don't trust them.
0	It’s a no from me, I will never get a vaccine, end of story!
1	It’s almost like, and stay with me here, but it’s almost like the vaccines work!
0	It’s an experiment on gullible humans.
0	It’s going to change our dna???! Yea no
1	It’s totally safe, they wouldn’t approve it if it wasn’t. Also the vaccine is based off other vaccine technologies that already exist that don’t harm people.
1	Ive been working as a volunteer trying to book people into get their vaccines, this video has some great easy to understand and relay information that I can let people know about so they feel safe and confident so thankyou.
0	I’ll be getting my vaccine on Neveruary 32nd.
0	I’ll never take this jab!!!
0	I’ll pass for now, stay on unemployment, keep wearing masks, laying low, and taking supplements for my immune system...while going to school on line...
0	I’ll take my chances with getting covid. I don’t trust our government AT ALL
1	I’m a week out of my pfirst Pfizer vaccine and pso pfar pso good. I haven’t experienced any pside effects, and I’m pfeeling pretty pfenomenal
1	I’m conservative and I always wear a mask. I got the Pfizer vaccine.
1	I’m fully dosed!
1	I’m happy about pfizer and the coronavirus vaccine
1	I’m just glad I’m educated enough to not abuse my children by preventing them from being Vaccinated.
0	I’m never going to take that vaccine pfffff hell to the no
0	I’m not getting this political vaccine
0	I’m not taking an mRNA ever. It’s DNA ALTERING
0	I’m not taking the vaccine AND I’m not taking off my tinfoil hat!
1	I’m so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
0	I’m still not gonna take it, I don’t trust a vaccine that has been made in 9 months, when its supposed to take 5-10 years to even make and get trusted.
1	I’m trying to convince my mom and dad to get there vaccine
1	I’m watching this now and I just got my vaccine yesterday. I want to stay safe for my mom which has diabetes.
0	I’ve had covid. So has my husband. I’d rather have it over and over again each year than take vaccine. I’m not okay with being lab rat for virus that has high recovery rate.
1	I’ve had my first dose of the oxford vaccine and can verify myself and family and friends who have had it had no serious side effects at all.
1	I’ve received both of mine! It’s nice to know I can protect myself, my patients and my family.
0	Johns and Johns is just a bad company lawsuit, now blood clots, I never us their products
1	Just because it happened to one guy, it doesn't mean it'll happen to every one of us. How many people die from medications for other diseases? Why hasn't that been put out on the news?
1	Just finished my first shift volunteering at the local Covid-19 vaccination centre and I got vaccinated as well!
1	Just got mine right now! Feeling great.
1	Just got mine this week, no side effects except some pain in my shoulder but it's not that big of a deal, like i hit the door or something
1	Just got my first Pfizer vaccine and it was very easy, it’s impressive the efficiency and organization I’ve seen at several of these vaccination locations.
1	Just got my first dose today. My arm is sore but I'm happy.
1	Just got my first dose u should really get the shot
1	Just got my first!
1	Just got my second dose Sunday and all I got was a sore arm. The next day I felt just the sore arm and by night time I was good. The next day all normal. Just get it done you’ll be happy and glad you’re done with already. Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
1	Just got my second!!
1	Just got my vaccine Pfizer...no side effects.
1	Just got my vaccine today, couldn't be more grateful and excited, so far so good
1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine I feel great
1	Just got vaccinated
1	Just signed up for my first dose, but really anxious about the side effect of it making me sick as im a type 2 diabetic that already takes forever to get over sickness, but hoping for the best
1	Just want to say thanks for explaining this! This really puts those numbers into perspective. And it's good to know that despite the difference in the numbers, each vaccine is safe enough to keep me away from the hospital or death.
1	Karens: "tHeRE'S nOThIng nAtUraL aBOUt VAcINes!1!!11" Immune System: *does 80% of the work of a vaccine*
1	Keep it going Moderna and thank you. Completely agree we have an engineering problem. We need the military to take over once these products come off the production lines and deliver the shot - no pun intended.
1	Keep making those doses. Good work.
0	Keep your poison
0	LAB RAT VACCINE DEPOPULATON PROGRAMME !
0	LIES - I wonder if you both can be sued? Keeping this if a family or friend die after taking this POISON!
1	Less than 1 in a MILLION side effects which is less than aspririne, less than having a plane fall on your head and even less than eating common food
1	Let's appreciate and applaud the doctors for helping us all
1	Let's not forget the time people thought A&W's third pounder burgers had less meat than McD's quarter pounders. Numbers are hard for some people.
0	Let's see how the vaccinated do after weeks, months and years. It could come out over time that the mortality rate for the vaccine is higher than the virus.
0	Lie. The best way to protect yourself from viruses is with a healthy robust immune system, which vaccines can actually damage.
1	Listen guys... I realize that some people have had adverse reactions to vaccines; but what you must realize is that it's generally a small minority of people that have any kind of severe reaction to a particular vaccine. If you weigh the benefits to the drawbacks, it just makes way more sense to get the vaccine, rather than risk getting Covid and having a severe reaction.
1	Literally just got my 2nd moderna shot 45 seconds ago! Woooo
0	Lol, well you sure rushed the first batch of poison through didn’t ya
0	MY BODY MY Choice. Forcing this is threatening a war on Humans.
1	Mail it to me.
0	Man I can't wait until I get this mysterious poison injected into my arm! It will save me from that virus that I haven't seen one person suffer from
1	Man imagine being one of those kids that never paid attention in high school and now thinks that all science is fake and that this vaccine is some brainwashing poison made by the government. Crazy what happens when kids are raised to not respect nor value the exact science meant to keep them alive longer.
0	Man will now be like a desk top computer they will be getting injected with anti virus vaccines every after three months this evil is being pushed by an evil hand
1	Mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations are the way to go. Maximum suppression is the best approach to isolate this virus, and the only way to make it safe to reopen schools from kindergarten through college.
0	Many companies’ vaccines have been revealed to be defective
0	Many who will do their own research will never fool with vaccines ....
0	Maybe moderna can tell us about the mice that died during the SARS COV -1 mRNA trials? And maybe a follow up question to see if they studied second time covid-19 exposure post injection because im just confused that they weren't concerned about all the mice dieing upon second contact of sars cov-1 after injection.
1	Me and my whole office did Sputnik-V. Half a year later no problem so far!
0	Met a man who’s 34 year old sister in law died 10 days after getting the vaccine. She was a police officer in Peru. Background that
1	Moderna side effects are rough, but I ll take it over catching Covid-19 again. It sucks big time!!
0	My aunt just got the second moderna and is feeling pain from head to toe.
0	My best friends dad died the following morning after receiving a vaccine. DO NOT PUT THIS EXPERIMENTAL POISON IN YOUR BODY!
0	My body my choice! I would NOT put that poison into my body!
0	My body, my choice
1	My brother had (predicted) complications from his measles vaccine (and other vaccines) as a kid, but he had a somewhat underdeveloped immune system in his early childhood, so if he'd gotten actual measles, he would've likely died. He got a fever for a few days and was groggy for a while. Nothing else happened, except he didn't get sick from these horrible diseases. And he was somewhat of a worst-case-scenario and he's fine. Now he's 20 and healthy. Vaccinate your kids, peeps, or they may not make it as far as he did.
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1	My dad over age 60 is scheduled to get a vaccine within weeks, we'll get it later due to eligibility.
0	My dad works in an assisted living facility where covid vaccines were administered to every resident. Within 5 days of giving vaccines, 3 residents died. All were physically heathy. The facility, state, and vaccine company refuse to say the vaccine had anything to do with it. No media coverage either. There is massive silencing of covid vaccine related deaths around the world.
0	My exhusbands father just died 2 weeks after getting his 2nd shot. I'm good. I do not need to get the shot. I wear a mask and stay out of big public places. Take vitamins people... Stay safe!!!
0	My family and I don't believe of the vaccine !! So we pass !! We will never take them nooooooo wayyyyyy !!!!!
0	My family doctor died two days after Covid 19 vaccine but they said his heart attack was not related.
0	My family is fully vaccinated but as for this experimental vaccine we're not going to take it yet we're young enough that we will survive if we get the virus and if it's safe we'll take it in the future
0	My favorite famous boxer Marvin Hagler, who has stronger body than a German Panzer, has just died today after receiving the covid-19 vaccine
1	My first jab of the Moderna I had a sore arm for a couple of days. My second jab of the Moderna I felt like I had been run over by a truck. Well, maybe by a small child driving a go-cart. It was unpleasant, but not brutal. And I would do it again knowing what was coming.
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	My household are fully vaccinated.
1	My husband, my Dad, and I are getting our first vaccination tomorrow. We are happy to get it.
0	My immune system will be my protection.
1	My mom (75), my partner and i (42) all got the pfizer. Tired the day after but that was it.
0	My mom died a few days after taking the 2nd vaccine shot, this last Saturday March 27th. I’m completely lost. She was just fine
0	My mother took this vaccine on 3rd April and today is 9th she is covid positive
1	My parents all grew up during the 50s/60s. They all knew multiple families that lost children to measles. I was pretty much vaccinated for anything they could get me for and I am perfectly healthy. Vaccinate your children, it saves lives.
0	My respect to all those that refuse this poison.
0	My sister works for one of these biotech companies that make the vaccine and she said it's all about the money.
0	My son says so many of his health problems stem from all the vaccines he got in the Navy!
0	My vaccine is Jesus Christ
0	NO COVID 19 HERE IN BURUNDI. WE ARE ALL WELL AND SAFE, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE COMING FROM ABROAD ONCE THEY REACH HERE THEY ARE COVERED WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS, SO, THERE IS NO NEED TO BRING THIS SATANIC VACCINE. AWAY FROM US IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
0	Nah.. nah..nah.. vaccine sounds so creepy to me, Boost Your own Immune System Peoples !!!
0	Neither safe nor effective. Enjoy your Poison.
0	Never ever I don’t want to I don’t trust any vaccines

I got vaccinated with covidsheild....feeling better after watching your video....I am safe... even I get infected after vaccination... No risk of hospitalization of death.... Thank you Nicely explained beautiful animation
0	No chance I'm taking it. Keep your toxins psychopaths
1	No negative effects please get vaccinated
0	No one is forcing me to take that poison.
0	No thank you.
0	No thanks - the vaccine is more dangerous than covid for me
0	No thanks I trust in the lord to keep me well
0	No thanks I'll see what people look like in 5 years who had the jab if they are still living!
0	No to forced or coerced injections.
0	No vaccine ever. You will not inject something I don’t want in my body
0	No vaccine for aids, cancer, but in one year y'all have vaccine for covid
0	No vaccine for me
0	No vaccines are any good for you
0	No vaccines or mask. Open the country and start living again without fear.
0	No way I'm taking this poison there going to have to force me or arrest me.
0	No way am I getting hurt by Flu vaccines again! No jab for me!
0	No way in hell I'll ever take the jab!
0	No way, it is not a vaccine it is an experimental drug.
0	No, I wont take it for sure! I don’t believe that this ‘virus’ is as deadly as they say firstly. Secondly the ‘vaccine’ is of no use at all.
0	Nope enjoy you side effect crap
0	Nope not taking a rushed experimental vaccine
0	Nope not taking it! No matter what the “Experts” say!
0	Nope, nope and nope............ not putting that stuff in me...........
0	Nope. This sounds like stuff from a sci fi movie. Telling my cells to make a protein it wasn't meant to make, to look like the virus. What could possible go wrong?
0	Norwegian officials said 23 people had died in the country a short time after receiving their first dose of the vaccine.
0	Not all of us are simple minded sheep like special interests were hoping.
1	Not being vaccinated is like starting life on hard mode.
0	Not in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
1	Nothing terrifies me more than seeing the increasing amount of cavemen who are against science. I expect at least 14 replies about why I should be as well. I can't wait
1	Now if only the conspiracy theorists actually cared about facts.
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types! 🤣
1	Number 2 baby! Arm already sore #Vaccinate
0	Of course it won’t hurt you immediately duh. The side effects kicks in later.
0	Of course they pressure parents & make them feel bad if you don't do it. Sick industry.
1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1	Of course.Most of all to be a patriot and protect all other humans.
0	One doctor in Florida died after the vaccine but of course you won’t hear about it
0	One thing to remember is once anything is shot into your body, you can't later change your mind and undo it.
1	Only in America would people protest against getting a vaccine that would protect you and your family from a virus.
0	Only trusting in the Lord.
1	Our technology is incredible and ill be one of the first to take this vaccine. It'll be way better then any vaccine seen today.
1	Out of all the people I know that got vaccinated, it was safe and quick for them
1	People are so stupid nowdays, I can't believe random people in the comment section think they know any better than medical professionals that went through extensive education for 12+ years and spent even more time in this field.
0	People are waking up. After my cousin's son had his shots he completely changed. They gave him more shots than he was due because he had been sick and was behind. I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0	People dying from vaccines!
0	People need to research this crap. Good luck sheep
1	People who refuse the vaccine should have to pay private for COVID treatment. These anti vax morons are so thick I doubt they can spell their own name without deep, deep thought.
0	Pfizer has no liability, and they are immune from prosecution. Let that sink in.
0	Pharma Industry = Big Scammers
0	Phase 3 trials won’t be completed until 2023 so are we the test subjects?
1	Planning on getting my vaccine shot really soon!
1	Please announce early as possible that vaccine is free far all please.
0	Please folks...do not take this experimental death serum.
0	Please save us from people who claim to care about our health at the same time medically rape us thru injection filling us with POISON
0	Poison vaccines
0	Poison. That’s all to it folks!
0	Pushing a vaccine for a virus with a high recovery rate? And not Health? Shameful!
1	Rather than attempting to shame those who've been offered the vaccine, support and encourage them. After all, as more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for everyone--including you.
1	Received my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday and besides a little injection site pain I’ve felt no symptoms.
1	Received my first Pfizer Vaccine yesterday evening, woke up with nothing but a sore arm, fatigue and a slight headache. Nothing a little over the counter medicine won't help! Definitely prefer these symptoms vs the alternative!
1	Sadly, there's no vaccine against stupidity.
0	Say no to vaccines!!!!
1	Science is real!!!!!
0	Scientific evidences? Who provides scientific evidences? The same that sell you the vaccine :-) Hahahaha
1	Seriously each and everyone must take vaccination as early as possible.This is the only way to control the covid.
0	Side Effects "You just might die" lmao
1	Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
0	Sir I'm so much scarred to take vaccine
0	So all the old people who died within 28 days of a faulty test definitely died of covid but those old people who died after the vaccine definitely didn't die of the vaccine. Ok.
0	So basically you are using the public as guinea pigs
1	So everyone is freaking out about 6 people out of 7 million. Ok
0	So far there's no sufficient evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission. Me taking it won't protect someone else's life. I'm a young guy in his 20s so the vaccine most likely won't save my life either. It might make it a more pleasant experience, but its not worth the risk of the hangover side effects. Human trials need 2 years to properly research potential long term effects anyway.
0	So glad I’m not going to be taking the vaccine.
1	So happy to have had my first covid vaccine
0	So let's see same shots same outcomes same problems same injuries same medical conditions same autism but vaccines no connection LOL
1	So much people are concerned but my mother and sister and their coworkers took the vaccine and had no symptoms other then a sore arm which is reasonable and if you are scared just wait to see the outcome
1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine.
0	So we DOOOOO have an immune system that can heal us without introducing unstable vaccines with little research and no long term cause information.
0	So you Knowillingly are injecting the public with toxic poison then?
0	So, when someone dies before vaccination, it’s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it; but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventative action is necessary...interesting.
0	So...who's still going to get any of the vaccines? Glad I didn't!
0	Sometimes you just can feel where something is not right and that most definitely includes this Vaccine
0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it
0	Stay away from me with that crap!
0	Stick yourselves we are out. THE PEOPLE
0	Still never taking this poison shot 🖕
0	Still not putting that shit in my arm.
0	Still not touching it with a barge pole - sorry! Have done too much research of my own. See the research of Celeste Solum and Deborah Tavares of Stop the Crime.Net for the truth.
0	Still scared to get the vaccine though. What if it genetically modifies my cell and gives me cancer or something like that
1	Stop panicking the word here is "rare"! As for the people not now going to have the Vaccine because of this risk, do you or your partner still take the contraceptive pill? As that is known to also cause blood colts!! Everything runs a risk!
0	Such lies! It’s all toxic crap injected into your body- which will bring about unhealthy side effects! It’s so sad seeing the world buying into governmental mind bending world alternating facts. The truth is out there people but you need to use your God given brain!
1	Sure hope there is a great cure fer it an hopefully there isnt anymore coming . it is a real bad thing . Stay home everyone if you can please.
0	Swine flu vaccine has caused narcolepsy in a good few people in Ireland, recent case settled linked below. There wasn't nearly as much pressure (or profit to be had) to be first to market with that vaccine compared to that of Covid now. I'd definitely be slightly hesitant to be first in line for a Covid vaccine.
0	Take the vaccine then the real health problems begin. These sheep never learn.
0	Take your shot and deal with it's side effects, why are so many willing to take it when they don't know anything about it? and if you die or have side effects they aren't liable...You forgot to mention the chip to verify you have gotten it.
1	Taking the vaccine will safe people
0	Tell that to the people who have died from the vaccine.
1	Tens of thousands of people die yearly from medical mistakes and drug reactions but people afraid of vaccines
1	Than you Pfizer for your vaccine. Please make a booster so that we're protected from these other variants.
1	Thank god its working
1	Thank you ,Doctor. You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion.
1	Thank you Moderna!!
1	Thank you Pfizer for your tireless effort and determination to help the whole world.
1	Thank you baby Jesus for the mRNA vaccines
1	Thank you for destroying antivaxxers and covidiots with logic and scientifical evidences. To be honest, I feel so impressed on how scientists and experts can develop vaccine for COVID-19 faster than ever, thanks to medical science and technology that advanced farther.
1	Thank you for making this video to clear up the misconceptions people may have! Im from Texas, USA, and a lot of healthcare workers have been administered their first dose (yay)!!!
1	Thank you for your vaccine. I was able to visit my 98 y.o. grandma for the first time in 18 months.
1	Thank you scientists for working hard!
1	Thank you. Unfortunately, most science deniers will just ignore you. Some people fail to appreciate the effort of dedicated health workers, virologist, physicians. Thank You
1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine... I appreciate the explanation ...
1	Thanks I really needed this because I haven’t been able to see my grand parents so I finally will
1	Thanks for creating this video! There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
1	Thanks for the video. It has helped convince my wife to get the vaccine.
1	Thanks so much, for the info on vaccines.
1	Thanks to both of you for the great information. Where can I find more information about getting vaccinated in my state? Az
1	That shot was so quick and smooth
0	That’s odd. Yet there’s been how many deaths of healthy young people after receiving mRNA vaccines, but they claim- nothing to see here
0	The Covid vaccine is basically that medicine that does more damage than it fixes
1	The anti vaxxers are stuck In a dangerous cult. It's a hard one who will I listen to a medical doctor with years of experience or someone with no medical training. Yeah sure a small number of people can have adverse reactions it's sad but this is a tiny percentage. Vaccines have saved so many lifes.
0	The big pharma insisting on having no liability is enough for me to say HELL NO!!
0	The bigiest lie in history
0	The country has lost its damn mind. Do not get vaccinated with an experimental vaccine while you're pregnant. Just because a doc says it's OK doesn't mean it is. Look at all the thalidomide babies! Good lord.
0	The covid 19 vaccines are killing and maming people this is a fact! How about telling people they may expect death or disability after their vaccine
0	The fact that Big Tech and Gov and Pharma along with Tik Tok nurses have combined forces to shame the world into taking this cocktail is enough reason to run from it
0	The fact that they’re even considering giving this out to children who are not even affected is incredibly disturbing. These people are so crooked.
0	The fact that those vaccine makers have legal immunity tells you everything you need to know about those toxic warp speed concoctions.
0	The fact the government has to keep using various methods to convince us that the vaccine is safe to take makes me never want to touch the damn thing
1	The fastest way out of this pandemic is through mass vaccination. This INCLUDES children. We can't vaccinate children without safety data - & to do that we need children in trials. If you have an adolescent interested - here's info about Moderna's trial.
0	The figures are reported if you die from covid but censored if you die from the vaccine. Hmmm.
0	The government dont give AF about any of us!! All this is so fishy that its scary!
0	The government intervened in the promotion of vaccines, which made the vaccine lose a certain degree of credibility
1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action.
1	The infection rate is 30k ish a day. Our vaccination is 20x better. Eat that COVID!
0	The ingredients wouldn't help a fly get better it's all nasty stuff why would anyone think those ingredients would keep you immunized it's ridiculous it's like the emperor's new clothes
1	The more people who are vaccinated, the more lives will be saved and the less the virus is in circulating the lower the chance of variants developing. It is right and sensible to take up the offer.
0	The next morning, Ching’s pharmacy was bombarded with calls from people anxious to be vaccinated. He had no shots left.
0	The only thing I'm concerned about is that I'm hearing that people are still getting Covid-19 after getting vaccinated! What's the point of getting the vaccine if you can still get Covid?
0	The point is you can get infected and recover without a vaccine, so why should I take it when there are no guarantees both ways?
1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research. Thanks for this video
0	The problem with this vaccine is that it sounds really shady and I don't like stuff that is shady.
0	The same people who have gaslighted and lied to us all these years are now pushing this rushed vaccine HARD. I’ll take my chances with the 99% survival rate of covid
0	The scariest thing about all of this is how naive and ignorant people are, they buy anything the media throws at them.
1	The science behind these new vaccines is so incredibly cool. What a time to be alive!
0	The vaccine brain damage has already got these people.
1	The vaccine has a low probability of side effects
0	The vaccine is a gateway to treatments more controversial...genetic instructions...Yay!
0	The vaccine is definitely some kind of thing to destroy the population
1	The vaccine is effective against the covid19
1	The vaccine is safe... study the ingredients, do research on the ingredients
1	The vaccine is working well
0	The vaccine will change your DNA forever
1	The worst part is the anti-vaxxers.
0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK
0	There is a multilevel agenda and much of this content endorses it. Keep that 💩 far tf away from me and my healthy family!
0	There is evidence that it has saved 10s of thousands of lives??? I dont think so!!
0	There’s no way they’re putting this Dragon piss in my arm!
0	These are not vaccines in a traditional sense. They are playing with your genes.
0	They are forcing me to take that poison!!
0	They are safe for no one
0	They can keep their needle. No thanks.
1	They know the vaccine is safe already. They had to trash its reputation in order to stop demand for something they simply do not have due to their useless preparations.
1	They need to focus on vaccinate everyone above 55 like ASAP. Even in third world countries bc that thing keeps goin around around and who knows wth is gonna turn into. And old ppl are the most at risk, once theyre vaccinated they can give it to younger ppl and get that virus under control.
0	They're missing the point - it's not about whether or not the vaccine works; it's your right to deny it if you wish, because it's your body.
0	This confirmed my decision I made a while ago...I'm not taking
0	This demon can’t even keep viruses out of windows, now he wants to vaccinate the whole world. oh my god, somebody wake up!!!
0	This is a experimental vaccin , you are the experiment.!
1	This is by far the best news since the vaccine came out imo. Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news
1	This is good news! I can see this is the beginning of the end of this pandemic. Hopefully, this virus will be completely eradicated by next year including the new variant.
1	This is incredibly reassuring. My sister and her boyfriend both just got J&J and I was a bit concerned for them, that they wouldn't be as protected as me or other people who got Pfizer or moderna.
1	This is objectively very fucking good.
0	This is the mark of the beast. Those who don't get it will suffer but not as much as those who do get it.
0	This is why it is better by far to go through proper extended testing instead of rushing in to mass vaccination.
1	This kind of educational videos about the vaccines should be aired all over the world and over mass media so that we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
1	This should be required viewing for every person who doesn't want to take it because they think the vaccine (for Covid19) is a hoax
0	This vaccine was quickly pushed through without knowing the long term effects or short term effects.This is a big no no .
0	Those were not intelligent people because they did not give valid facts or good reasons why they're not interested. My reason is simple ( the shot has things in it that disrupt the immune system ) , plus I have an immune system thats strong and works. ( Sunday April 4rth 2021 Happy Resurrection DAY )
0	Thumbs DOWN.......DONT TAKE IT...
1	Today is my birthday and I couldn’t have asked for a better gift then to break all these vaccine records, awesome news!
1	Took mine no side effects at all just arm was a little sore
1	Took my first dose today in Illinois, feeling good!
1	Took my first part of the vaccine, didn't feel a thing...
0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years. I understand we can't do that right now. But who knows what it's going to show long-term
1	Trump lies even when the truth will do. The tens of thousands of lies he has told that his adoring followers believe (a fair share of those lies being about COVID-19) has so polluted the Republican Party that it has morphed into America's Fifth Column. The reluctance by his followers to get vaccinated is based on lies told by him and other Republican politicians, and not only puts all of us at risk, but all of the world's population at risk. Moreover, there has been evidence that mammalian animal species such as cats (big and small), dogs and minks can be infected with COVID-19, aka SARS-CoV-2. While these animals currently do not seem to become seriously ill or even to die the possibility exists that they could become reservoirs or vectors of the virus that they could then pass on, possibly as a lethal variant, back to humans. Mississippi, wake up! America, wake up! Get vaccinated!
0	Ummm, I'll pass on that. I'll wait until these politicians and celebrities shows how effective it is. It seems like the side effects is worst than Covid-19 itself
1	Unvaccinated kids are just speedrunning life
1	Vacations are wonderful.
1	Vaccinate the working population first and the teachers get the kids back to school and the people back to work it makes more sense before we all die from starvation
1	Vaccination is a human right .
0	Vaccine and illuminate sign this vaccine is number 666 sign that if you have no this vaccine 666 you can't buy a sell Satan program. Don't agree this .
0	Vaccine is not an appropriate word. The word is experimental. Please do your research before deciding to have an EXPERIMENTAL AGENT injected into your body. Stay safe.
1	Vaccines and medications aren’t destroying humanity, no — it’s the anti-vaxxer community’s complete ignorance and misinformation that’s destroying humanity from being able to save itself.
1	Vaccines are really good for you.
1	Vaccines are safe
1	Vaccines are safe, and save lives.
1	Vaccines are wonderful. However, I will wait a bit before getting this one. Many different vaccines for COVID-19 and Astra Zeneca one has been halted.
1	Vaccines can have a certain effect
1	Vaccines can help to improve your immunity
1	Vaccines can't fight COVID-19 when people are unwilling to take them.
0	Vaccines do not cause autism. Sure. I have autistic daughter. When she was 8 month she was vaccinated (6in1). Next day she got fever, she got normal after 3-4 days. But after 2 weeks she stopped to laugh, look in the eyes and play with her toys. She became quiet, kind of thinking inside. Now she's 10 yo. She can't talk and shows typical autism symptoms. I've done her hair analysis and it clearly showed that after vaccination the level of aluminium in her body raised multiple times above secure levels. Continue to lie.
1	Vaccines help boost immunity
1	Vaccines save lives! Please don't hesitate to be a part of this universal fight against #COVID19
1	Very rare 1:100,000 to 1:600,000 risk of clots with vaccine
1	Very well said as the proper treatment will save the lives of millions of people.
0	Vitamin D. Zinc. Vitamin C and others are the way for me.
0	WAKE UP!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTH!!! BEING SICK IS A BUSINESS $$$$
1	WELL THANK GOD FOR THIS VACCINE
0	WORD OF THE LORD: DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE. PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY BECOME ZOMBIES WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS!!! Pray and confirm before you mock and scoff!
0	Was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after being vaccinated
1	Was finally able to get my first dose Wednesday, feeling good no side effects
1	Watching this after getting my first dose of Moderna Vaccine!
0	We all been told 10 months ago: use sanitiser and wear face masks, and everything is going to be okay. And what happened? Nothing! We all still sitting at home, without jobs, loosen our businesses. And you telling us now again: use vaccine which was tested couple of months, and everything is going to be okay. No thanks...)))
1	We are all in this together you good little citizens!
0	We are just guinea pigs. This is what you get when you put murdered baby material into people's arms.
0	We as the people need to fight back by not taking it n if they try to force it that means war time
1	We can do it! I'm literally sitting in the waiting area after getting my first shot right now!
0	We don't need a "vaccine" for something with a 98% survival rate!
0	Well I WONT BE GETTING ANY BLOODY Needle, there is no way this is ready for release , it's still mutating .
1	Well you've got more chance of catching Covid and developing severe blood clots from that than you do from any vaccine. FACT.
0	What about the part that changes the host (our) DNA? And please, don't even try to obfuscate the fact that it does - because it does change it! Or that is why the leading scientists, doctors, phd holders which confirm and prove this with evidence are being silenced, conditioned, discredited, prosecuted... People are not stupid!!! They know your game...
0	What could possibly go wrong? Never made a coronavirus vaccine before, never used mRNA before, but we're gonna do it now, as fast as possible? Yikes.
0	When you eat something it is mandatory to have the ingredients on the label when you get a vaccine questioning what the ingrdience is taboo because if you understood you would never agree to injecting poison into your body
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
0	Who else is packing up for this zombie apocalypse
1	Why are people anti-vaxxers? I don’t get it
0	Why are people taking a experimental vaccine, for a virus with a 99% survival rate?
0	Why do you have to explain this over and over is it even worth it? Here in Zimbabwe we are using natural remedies and have proven effective so far so good
0	Why don't you properly test these drugs first ffs?!
0	Why get a vaccine when it is proven that you can get the virus again even after the vaccine. I would rather get the virus again and not get a dirty old vaccine.
0	Why get the vaccine if you can still get COVID if you get it??
0	Why in bloody hell world anyone want to take this vaccine when you've got a better then 99% chance of not dying
0	Why is the vaccine wait the zombies is there gonna be zombies
0	Why not speak about the long term affects of all the covid vaccines? Because nobody knows for sure
0	Why would I put something in my body when I don’t even know what’s in it?
0	Why would a healthy fit person need to take it of whatever age when it has been created in less than 8 months not knowing long term side effects.
0	Why would young healthy people get a vaccination for a virus with a 98% survival rate?
1	Wife and I received our pfizer today, and nothing but a sore arm.
0	Will I take this vaccine, let me think for a minute, NOOOOOOOO
0	Won't be going anywhere near this poison!!
1	Woohoo! Just got home from getting my second shot (Pfizer)
1	Would have loved it more if it had dedicated more explaining about the mRNA part, cause that’s the part antivaxxers use to spread fear.
0	Y'all can have my doses. Enjoy........
0	Y'all stupid if u think I'm a take a vaccine
1	Yay! I get the J&J Tuesday! Can’t wait!!!
0	Yea right, no one knows the effects of this new vaccine product, long term especially. The world is the project.
1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take.
0	Yeah it’s dangerous for us to think outside public opinion... that means we’re probably doing something right
0	Yeah passing on all of it.
1	Yes Moderna or RNA is very effective, I am done with 2 shots already, No side effect whatsoever.
1	Yes! Everyone associated with healthcare needs to be vaccinated. Thank you.
1	Yes, absolutely. I will get it when it is available to me given my spot on the priority list.
1	Yes, please let the public know that our scientists and medical professionals are working hard for the good of the people! ALL PEOPLE!!
0	You call it side effects, I call it direct effects. No poison in my body!
0	You can expect blood clots
0	You can have my dose.....keep that experimental biological agent. If I wanted to participate in a clinical trial, it would be for something legitimate....
0	You can have my shots since you are so confident.
0	You couldn't pay me to take that poison
0	You don't need to be vaccinated against a virus with a 99% recovery rate!
1	You guys are ok to be a little scared, it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine.
1	You just convinced me to not be picky about vaccines. Thank You!
0	You just won the jackpot of one million blood clots. Congratulations.
1	You know right now we really need a covid vaccine right now
1	You should make vaccines As early as you can
0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious????????????????????
0	You won’t know what it’s done to your body for years to come
0	You're all lairs and' very unfair and' so unfaithful to the peoples' worldwide's pleasing bill gates and melinda gates' hates crimes just for money
1	You're more likely to get hit by a falling coconut than get a blood clot from AstraZeneca.
1	Yup. By the time I get it it'll have been more than a year since I last saw my mum, so after getting injected I'll be heading directly to the airport.
1	a similar vaccine, had a similar case during clinical trials
0	a vax for flu & colds is a profit making venture not a humanitarian effort ..
1	all the dislikes are anti survivers
1	all the people scared of a VACCINE in the comments are pathetic. id rather be injected with a faulty vaccine than be infected with a disease that KILLS PEOPLE
1	am.full support of the vaccine I we always against those people that says bad thing about the vaccine
0	and now they want to vaccinate the entire world with their covid vaccine and ignoring all these adverse reactions from these other vaccines to our children!
0	bad sales pitch for the COVID vaccine. NOPE NOT TAKING IT
1	basically if you get side effects from the vaccine it means it's working. I wish people can understand this.
0	continue with the testing and ensure it's safe before distribution
0	don't take their vaccines, do your own research please people. information is being silenced
1	don’t feel bad after the vaccine
1	feel better being protected
1	feel good after injecting
0	feel unwell after the vaccine
1	fighting this pandemic
1	funny thing is... you are probably only still alive now because of the vaccines you and others have already taken
0	good luck with your poison shots!
1	got my first dose of pfizer yesterday. been feeling like shit for a while now. but glad i got one
1	have been vaccinated and think it’s not bad
1	help to get antibodies
0	herd immunity will come
1	i don’t care how long it lasts, if i need to get another dose next week, i’ll be the first in line!
1	i finally realised why i was sick for 2 weeks after getting the needles in me. it's to build memory cell so in the future i don't get sick easily and fight off bacteria faster.
1	i got my Pfizer second dose yesterday!
0	i live in NH. my doctor tried talking me into the vaccine today i’m pregnant... they have no studies on how that would effect the baby or me 😂 she goes well we think it’s safe. y’all also thought the polio vaccine was safe and look how that worked out.
0	i love how they leave out the fact these trails are expected to be finished by 2023 and none of these vaccines are FDA approved
0	i was anti vaxxed and i have not gotten sick for 3 years before and how are wild animals ok if they were not vaccinated?
